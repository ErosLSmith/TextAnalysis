HORROR and fatality have been stalking abroad in all ages.|0|1|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Why then give a date to this story I have to tell?|1|1|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Let it suffice to say, that at the period of which I speak, there existed, in the interior of Hungary, a settled although hidden belief in the doctrines of the Metempsychosis.|2|1|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Of the doctrines themselves–that is, of their falsity, or of their probability–I say nothing.|3|1|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"I assert, however, that much of our incredulity–as La Bruyere says of all our unhappiness–""vient de ne pouvoir etre seuls""."|4|1|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
But there are some points in the Hungarian superstition which were fast verging to absurdity.|0|2|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
They–the Hungarians–differed very essentially from their Eastern authorities.|1|2|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"For example, ""The soul,"" said the former–I give the words of an acute and intelligent Parisian–""ne demeure qu'un seul fois dans un corps sensible: au reste–un cheval, un chien, un homme meme, n'est que la ressemblance peu tangible de ces animaux""."|2|2|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
The families of Berlifitzing and Metzengerstein had been at variance for centuries.|0|3|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Never before were two houses so illustrious, mutually embittered by hostility so deadly.|1|3|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"Indeed at the era of this history, it was observed by an old crone of haggard and sinister appearance, that ""fire and water might sooner mingle than a Berlifitzing clasp the hand of a Metzengerstein""."|2|3|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"The origin of this enmity seems to be found in the words of an ancient prophecy–""A lofty name shall have a fearful fall when, as the rider over his horse, the mortality of Metzengerstein shall triumph over the immortality of Berlifitzing""."|3|3|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
To be sure the words themselves had little or no meaning.|0|4|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
But more trivial causes have given rise–and that no long while ago–to consequences equally eventful.|1|4|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Besides, the estates, which were contiguous, had long exercised a rival influence in the affairs of a busy government.|2|4|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Moreover, near neighbors are seldom friends; and the inhabitants of the Castle Berlifitzing might look, from their lofty buttresses, into the very windows of the palace Metzengerstein.|3|4|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Least of all had the more than feudal magnificence, thus discovered, a tendency to allay the irritable feelings of the less ancient and less wealthy Berlifitzings.|4|4|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
What wonder then, that the words, however silly, of that prediction, should have succeeded in setting and keeping at variance two families already predisposed to quarrel by every instigation of hereditary jealousy?|5|4|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
The prophecy seemed to imply–if it implied anything–a final triumph on the part of the already more powerful house; and was of course remembered with the more bitter animosity by the weaker and less influential.|6|4|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Wilhelm, Count Berlifitzing, although loftily descended, was, at the epoch of this narrative, an infirm and doting old man, remarkable for nothing but an inordinate and inveterate personal antipathy to the family of his rival, and so passionate a love of horses, and of hunting, that neither bodily infirmity, great age, nor mental incapacity, prevented his daily participation in the dangers of the chase.|0|5|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Frederick, Baron Metzengerstein, was, on the other hand, not yet Mary, followed him quickly after.|0|6|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Frederick was, at that time, in his fifteenth year.|1|6|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
In a city, fifteen years are no long period–a child may be still a child in his third lustrum: but in a wilderness–in so magnificent a wilderness as that old principality, fifteen years have a far deeper meaning.|2|6|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
The beautiful Lady Mary!|0|7|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
How could she die?|1|7|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
–and of consumption!|2|7|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
But it is a path I have prayed to follow.|3|7|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
I would wish all I love to perish of that gentle disease.|4|7|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
How glorious–to depart in the heyday of the young blood–the heart of all passion–the imagination all fire–amid the remembrances of happier days–in the fall of the year- and so be buried up forever in the gorgeous autumnal leaves!|5|7|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Thus died the Lady Mary.|0|8|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
The young Baron Frederick stood without a living relative by the coffin of his dead mother.|1|8|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
He placed his hand upon her placid forehead.|2|8|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
No shudder came over his delicate frame–no sigh from his flinty bosom.|3|8|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Heartless, self-willed and impetuous from his childhood, he had reached the age of which I speak through a career of unfeeling, wanton, and reckless dissipation; and a barrier had long since arisen in the channel of all holy thoughts and gentle recollections.|4|8|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
From some peculiar circumstances attending the administration of his father, the young Baron, at the decease of the former, entered immediately upon his vast possessions.|0|9|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Such estates were seldom held before by a nobleman of Hungary.|1|9|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
His castles were without number.|2|9|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"The chief in point of splendor and extent was the ""Chateau Metzengerstein""."|3|9|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
The boundary line of his dominions was never clearly defined; but his principal park embraced a circuit of fifty miles.|4|9|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Upon the succession of a proprietor so young, with a character so well known, to a fortune so unparalleled, little speculation was afloat in regard to his probable course of conduct.|0|10|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
And, indeed, for the space of three days, the behavior of the heir out-heroded Herod, and fairly surpassed the expectations of his most enthusiastic admirers.|1|10|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Shameful debaucheries–flagrant treacheries–unheard-of atrocities–gave his trembling vassals quickly to understand that no servile submission on their part–no punctilios of conscience on his own–were thenceforward to prove any security against the remorseless fangs of a petty Caligula.|2|10|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
On the night of the fourth day, the stables of the castle Berlifitzing were discovered to be on fire; and the unanimous opinion of the neighborhood added the crime of the incendiary to the already hideous list of the Baron's misdemeanors and enormities.|3|10|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
But during the tumult occasioned by this occurrence, the young nobleman himself sat apparently buried in meditation, in a vast and desolate upper apartment of the family palace of Metzengerstein.|0|11|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
The rich although faded tapestry hangings which swung gloomily upon the walls, represented the shadowy and majestic forms of a thousand illustrious ancestors.|1|11|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Here, rich-ermined priests, and pontifical dignitaries, familiarly seated with the autocrat and the sovereign, put a veto on the wishes of a temporal king, or restrained with the fiat of papal supremacy the rebellious sceptre of the Arch-enemy.|2|11|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
There, the dark, tall statures of the Princes Metzengerstein–their muscular war-coursers plunging over the carcasses of fAllan foes–startled the steadiest nerves with their vigorous expression; and here, again, the voluptuous and swan-like figures of the dames of days gone by, floated away in the mazes of an unreal dance to the strains of imaginary melody.|3|11|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
But as the Baron listened, or affected to listen, to the gradually increasing uproar in the stables of Berlifitzing–or perhaps pondered upon some more novel, some more decided act of audacity–his eyes became unwittingly rivetted to the figure of an enormous, and unnaturally colored horse, represented in the tapestry as belonging to a Saracen ancestor of the family of his rival.|0|12|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
The horse itself, in the foreground of the design, stood motionless and statue-like–while farther back, its discomfited rider perished by the dagger of a Metzengerstein.|1|12|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
On Frederick's lip arose a fiendish expression, as he became aware of the direction which his glance had, without his consciousness, assumed.|0|13|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Yet he did not remove it.|1|13|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
On the contrary, he could by no means account for the overwhelming anxiety which appeared falling like a pall upon his senses.|2|13|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
It was with difficulty that he reconciled his dreamy and incoherent feelings with the certainty of being awake.|3|13|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
The longer he gazed the more absorbing became the spell–the more impossible did it appear that he could ever withdraw his glance from the fascination of that tapestry.|4|13|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
But the tumult without becoming suddenly more violent, with a compulsory exertion he diverted his attention to the glare of ruddy light thrown full by the flaming stables upon the windows of the apartment.|5|13|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
The action, however, was but momentary, his gaze returned mechanically to the wall.|0|14|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
To his extreme horror and astonishment, the head of the gigantic steed had, in the meantime, altered its position.|1|14|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
The neck of the animal, before arched, as if in compassion, over the prostrate body of its lord, was now extended, at full length, in the direction of the Baron.|2|14|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
The eyes, before invisible, now wore an energetic and human expression, while they gleamed with a fiery and unusual red; and the distended lips of the apparently enraged horse left in full view his gigantic and disgusting teeth.|3|14|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Stupefied with terror, the young nobleman tottered to the door.|0|15|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
As he threw it open, a flash of red light, streaming far into the chamber, flung his shadow with a clear outline against the quivering tapestry, and he shuddered to perceive that shadow–as he staggered awhile upon the threshold–assuming the exact position, and precisely filling up the contour, of the relentless and triumphant murderer of the Saracen Berlifitzing.|1|15|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
To lighten the depression of his spirits, the Baron hurried into the open air.|0|16|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
At the principal gate of the palace he encountered three equerries.|1|16|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
With much difficulty, and at the imminent peril of their lives, they were restraining the convulsive plunges of a gigantic and fiery-colored horse.|2|16|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"""Whose horse?"|0|17|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"Where did you get him""?"|1|17|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
demanded the youth, in a querulous and husky tone of voice, as he became instantly aware that the mysterious steed in the tapestried chamber was the very counterpart of the furious animal before his eyes.|2|17|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"""He is your own property, sire,"" replied one of the equerries, ""at least he is claimed by no other owner."|0|18|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
We caught him flying, all smoking and foaming with rage, from the burning stables of the Castle Berlifitzing.|1|18|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Supposing him to have belonged to the old Count's stud of foreign horses, we led him back as an estray.|2|18|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
But the grooms there disclaim any title to the creature; which is strange, since he bears evident marks of having made a narrow escape from the flames.|3|18|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"""The letters W. V. B. are also branded very distinctly on his forehead,"" interrupted a second equerry, ""I supposed them, of course, to be the initials of Wilhelm Von Berlifitzing–but all at the castle are positive in denying any knowledge of the horse""."|0|19|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"""Extremely singular""!"|0|20|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
said the young Baron, with a musing air, and apparently unconscious of the meaning of his words.|1|20|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"""He is, as you say, a remarkable horse–a prodigious horse!"|2|20|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"although, as you very justly observe, of a suspicious and untractable character, let him be mine, however,"" he added, after a pause, ""perhaps a rider like Frederick of Metzengerstein, may tame even the devil from the stables of Berlifitzing""."|3|20|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"""You are mistaken, my lord; the horse, as I think we mentioned, is not from the stables of the Count."|0|21|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"If such had been the case, we know our duty better than to bring him into the presence of a noble of your family""."|1|21|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"""True""!"|0|22|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
observed the Baron, dryly, and at that instant a page of the bedchamber came from the palace with a heightened color, and a precipitate step.|1|22|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
He whispered into his master's ear an account of the sudden disappearance of a small portion of the tapestry, in an apartment which he designated; entering, at the same time, into particulars of a minute and circumstantial character; but from the low tone of voice in which these latter were communicated, nothing escaped to gratify the excited curiosity of the equerries.|2|22|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
The young Frederick, during the conference, seemed agitated by a variety of emotions.|0|23|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
He soon, however, recovered his composure, and an expression of determined malignancy settled upon his countenance, as he gave peremptory orders that a certain chamber should be immediately locked up, and the key placed in his own possession.|1|23|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"""Have you heard of the unhappy death of the old hunter Berlifitzing""?"|0|24|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
said one of his vassals to the Baron, as, after the departure of the page, the huge steed which that nobleman had adopted as his own, plunged and curvetted, with redoubled fury, down the long avenue which extended from the chateau to the stables of Metzengerstein.|1|24|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"""No""!"|0|25|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"said the Baron, turning abruptly toward the speaker, ""dead!"|1|25|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"say you""?"|2|25|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"""It is indeed true, my lord; and, to a noble of your name, will be, I imagine, no unwelcome intelligence""."|0|26|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
A rapid smile shot over the countenance of the listener.|0|27|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"""How died he""?"|1|27|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"""In his rash exertions to rescue a favorite portion of his hunting stud, he has himself perished miserably in the flames""."|0|28|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"""I-n-d-e-e-d-""!"|0|29|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
ejaculated the Baron, as if slowly and deliberately impressed with the truth of some exciting idea.|1|29|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"""Indeed;"" repeated the vassal."|0|30|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"""Shocking""!"|0|31|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
said the youth, calmly, and turned quietly into the chateau.|1|31|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
From this date a marked alteration took place in the outward demeanor of the dissolute young Baron Frederick Von Metzengerstein.|0|32|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Indeed, his behavior disappointed every expectation, and proved little in accordance with the views of many a manoeuvering mamma; while his habits and manner, still less than formerly, offered any thing congenial with those of the neighboring aristocracy.|1|32|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
He was never to be seen beyond the limits of his own domain, and, in this wide and social world, was utterly companionless–unless, indeed, that unnatural, impetuous, and fiery-colored horse, which he henceforward continually bestrode, had any mysterious right to the title of his friend.|2|32|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Numerous invitations on the part of the neighborhood for a long time, however, periodically came in.|0|33|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"""Will the Baron honor our festivals with his presence""?"|1|33|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"""Will the Baron join us in a hunting of the boar""?"|2|33|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"–""Metzengerstein does not hunt;"" ""Metzengerstein will not attend,"" were the haughty and laconic answers."|3|33|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
These repeated insults were not to be endured by an imperious nobility.|0|34|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Such invitations became less cordial–less frequent–in time they ceased altogether.|1|34|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"The widow of the unfortunate Count Berlifitzing was even heard to express a hope ""that the Baron might be at home when he did not wish to be at home, since he disdained the company of his equals; and ride when he did not wish to ride, since he preferred the society of a horse""."|2|34|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
This to be sure was a very silly explosion of hereditary pique; and merely proved how singularly unmeaning our sayings are apt to become, when we desire to be unusually energetic.|3|34|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
The charitable, nevertheless, attributed the alteration in the conduct of the young nobleman to the natural sorrow of a son for the untimely loss of his parents–forgetting, however, his atrocious and reckless behavior during the short period immediately succeeding that bereavement.|0|35|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Some there were, indeed, who suggested a too haughty idea of self-consequence and dignity.|1|35|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Others again (among them may be mentioned the family physician) did not hesitate in speaking of morbid melancholy, and hereditary ill-health; while dark hints, of a more equivocal nature, were current among the multitude.|2|35|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Indeed, the Baron's perverse attachment to his lately-acquired charger–an attachment which seemed to attain new strength from every fresh example of the animal's ferocious and demon-like propensities- at length became, in the eyes of all reasonable men, a hideous and unnatural fervor.|0|36|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
In the glare of noon–at the dead hour of night–in sickness or in health–in calm or in tempest–the young Metzengerstein seemed rivetted to the saddle of that colossal horse, whose intractable audacities so well accorded with his own spirit.|1|36|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
There were circumstances, moreover, which coupled with late events, gave an unearthly and portentous character to the mania of the rider, and to the capabilities of the steed.|0|37|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
The space passed over in a single leap had been accurately measured, and was found to exceed, by an astounding difference, the wildest expectations of the most imaginative.|1|37|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
The Baron, besides, had no particular name for the animal, although all the rest in his collection were distinguished by characteristic appellations.|2|37|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
His stable, too, was appointed at a distance from the rest; and with regard to grooming and other necessary offices, none but the owner in person had ventured to officiate, or even to enter the enclosure of that particular stall.|3|37|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
It was also to be observed, that although the three grooms, who had caught the steed as he fled from the conflagration at Berlifitzing, had succeeded in arresting his course, by means of a chain-bridle and noose–yet no one of the three could with any certainty affirm that he had, during that dangerous struggle, or at any period thereafter, actually placed his hand upon the body of the beast.|4|37|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Instances of peculiar intelligence in the demeanor of a noble and high-spirited horse are not to be supposed capable of exciting unreasonable attention–especially among men who, daily trained to the labors of the chase, might appear well acquainted with the sagacity of a horse–but there were certain circumstances which intruded themselves per force upon the most skeptical and phlegmatic; and it is said there were times when the animal caused the gaping crowd who stood around to recoil in horror from the deep and impressive meaning of his terrible stamp–times when the young Metzengerstein turned pale and shrunk away from the rapid and searching expression of his earnest and human-looking eye.|5|37|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
Among all the retinue of the Baron, however, none were found to doubt the ardor of that extraordinary affection which existed on the part of the young nobleman for the fiery qualities of his horse; at least, none but an insignificant and misshapen little page, whose deformities were in everybody's way, and whose opinions were of the least possible importance.|0|38|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
He–if his ideas are worth mentioning at all–had the effrontery to assert that his master never vaulted into the saddle without an unaccountable and almost imperceptible shudder, and that, upon his return from every long-continued and habitual ride, an expression of triumphant malignity distorted every muscle in his countenance.|1|38|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
One tempestuous night, Metzengerstein, awaking from a heavy slumber, descended like a maniac from his chamber, and, mounting in hot haste, bounded away into the mazes of the forest.|0|39|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
An occurrence so common attracted no particular attention, but his return was looked for with intense anxiety on the part of his domestics, when, after some hours' absence, the stupendous and magnificent battlements of the Chateau Metzengerstein, were discovered crackling and rocking to their very foundation, under the influence of a dense and livid mass of ungovernable fire.|1|39|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
As the flames, when first seen, had already made so terrible a progress that all efforts to save any portion of the building were evidently futile, the astonished neighborhood stood idly around in silent and pathetic wonder.|0|40|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
But a new and fearful object soon rivetted the attention of the multitude, and proved how much more intense is the excitement wrought in the feelings of a crowd by the contemplation of human agony, than that brought about by the most appalling spectacles of inanimate matter.|1|40|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
"Up the long avenue of aged oaks which led from the forest to the main entrance of the Chateau Metzengerstein, a steed, bearing an unbonneted and disordered rider, was seen leaping with an impetuosity which outstripped the very Demon of the Tempest, and extorted from every stupefied beholder the ejaculation–""horrible""."|0|41|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
The career of the horseman was indisputably, on his own part, uncontrollable.|0|42|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
The agony of his countenance, the convulsive struggle of his frame, gave evidence of superhuman exertion: but no sound, save a solitary shriek, escaped from his lacerated lips, which were bitten through and through in the intensity of terror.|1|42|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
One instant, and the clattering of hoofs resounded sharply and shrilly above the roaring of the flames and the shrieking of the winds–another, and, clearing at a single plunge the gate-way and the moat, the steed bounded far up the tottering staircases of the palace, and, with its rider, disappeared amid the whirlwind of chaotic fire.|2|42|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
The fury of the tempest immediately died away, and a dead calm sullenly succeeded.|0|43|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire
A white flame still enveloped the building like a shroud, and, streaming far away into the quiet atmosphere, shot forth a glare of preternatural light; while a cloud of smoke settled heavily over the battlements in the distinct colossal figure of–a horse.|1|43|Metzengerstein|January 14, 1832|Horror / Satire

"The author of the Parnasse Reforme makes him thus speak in Hades:–""L'homme donc qui voudrait savoir ce dont Je suis morte, qu'il ne demande pas si'l fut de fievre ou de podagre ou d'autre chose, mais qui'l entende que ce fut de 'L'Andromache."|1|3|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor

From its queenly possessor La Bellissima, to the Duc De L'Omelette, six peers of the empire conveyed the happy bird.|1|4|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
That night the Duc was to sup alone.|0|5|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
In the privacy of his bureau he reclined languidly on that ottoman for which he sacrificed his loyalty in outbidding his king–the notorious ottoman of Cadet.|1|5|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
He buries his face in the pillow.|0|6|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
The clock strikes!|1|6|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
Unable to restrain his feelings, his Grace swallows an olive.|2|6|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
At this moment the door gently opens to the sound of soft music, and lo!|3|6|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
the most delicate of birds is before the most enamored of men!|4|6|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
But what inexpressible dismay now overshadows the countenance of the Duc?|5|6|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
"- ""Horreur!"|6|6|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
–chien!|7|6|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor

ah, bon Dieu!|10|6|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
"cet oiseau modeste que tu as deshabille de ses plumes, et que tu as servi sans papier""!"|11|6|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
It is superfluous to say more:–the Duc expired in a paroxysm of disgust.|12|6|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
"""Ha!"|0|7|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor

"Who are you, pray, that I, Duc De L'Omelette, Prince de Foie-Gras, just come of age, author of the 'Mazurkiad,' and Member of the Academy, should divest myself at your bidding of the sweetest pantaloons ever made by Bourdon, the daintiest robe-de-chambre ever put together by Rombert–to say nothing of the taking my hair out of paper–not to mention the trouble I should have in drawing off my gloves""?"|3|11|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
"""Who am I?"|0|12|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor

I am Baal-Zebub, Prince of the Fly.|2|12|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
I took thee, just now, from a rose-wood coffin inlaid with ivory.|3|12|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
Thou wast curiously scented, and labelled as per invoice.|4|12|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
Belial sent thee,–my Inspector of Cemeteries.|5|12|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
"The pantaloons, which thou sayest were made by Bourdon, are an excellent pair of linen drawers, and thy robe-de-chambre is a shroud of no scanty dimensions""."|6|12|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
"""Sir""!"|0|13|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor

- Sir!|2|13|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
I shall take the earliest opportunity of avenging this insult!|3|13|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor

"in the meantime au revoir""!"|6|13|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
–and the Duc was bowing himself out of the Satanic presence, when he was interrupted and brought back by a gentleman in waiting.|7|13|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
Hereupon his Grace rubbed his eyes, yawned, shrugged his shoulders, reflected.|8|13|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
Having become satisfied of his identity, he took a bird's eye view of his whereabouts.|9|13|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
The apartment was superb.|0|14|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
Even De L'Omelette pronounced it bien comme il faut.|1|14|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
It was not its length nor its breadth,–but its height–ah, that was appalling!|2|14|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
–There was no ceiling–certainly none- but a dense whirling mass of fiery-colored clouds.|3|14|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
His Grace's brain reeled as he glanced upward.|4|14|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
From above, hung a chain of an unknown blood-red metal–its upper end lost, like the city of Boston, parmi les nues.|5|14|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
From its nether extremity swung a large cresset.|6|14|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
The Duc knew it to be a ruby; but from it there poured a light so intense, so still, so terrible, Persia never worshipped such–Gheber never imagined such–Mussulman never dreamed of such when, drugged with opium, he has tottered to a bed of poppies, his back to the flowers, and his face to the God Apollo.|7|14|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
The Duc muttered a slight oath, decidedly approbatory.|8|14|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
The corners of the room were rounded into niches.|0|15|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
Three of these were filled with statues of gigantic proportions.|1|15|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
Their beauty was Grecian, their deformity Egyptian, their tout ensemble French.|2|15|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
In the fourth niche the statue was veiled; it was not colossal.|3|15|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
But then there was a taper ankle, a sandalled foot.|4|15|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
De L'Omelette pressed his hand upon his heart, closed his eyes, raised them, and caught his Satanic Majesty–in a blush.|5|15|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
But the paintings!|0|16|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
–Kupris!|1|16|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
Astarte!|2|16|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor

And Rafaelle has beheld them!|5|16|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
Yes, Rafaelle has been here, for did he not paint the ---?|6|16|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
and was he not consequently damned?|7|16|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
The paintings–the paintings!|8|16|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
O luxury!|9|16|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
O love!|10|16|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
–who, gazing on those forbidden beauties, shall have eyes for the dainty devices of the golden frames that besprinkled, like stars, the hyacinth and the porphyry walls?|11|16|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
But the Duc's heart is fainting within him.|0|17|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
He is not, however, as you suppose, dizzy with magnificence, nor drunk with the ecstatic breath of those innumerable censers.|1|17|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
C'est vrai que de toutes ces choses il a pense beaucoup–mais!|2|17|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
The Duc De L'Omelette is terror-stricken; for, through the lurid vista which a single uncurtained window is affording, lo!|3|17|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
gleams the most ghastly of all fires!|4|17|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
Le pauvre Duc!|0|18|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
He could not help imagining that the glorious, the voluptuous, the never-dying melodies which pervaded that hall, as they passed filtered and transmuted through the alchemy of the enchanted window-panes, were the wailings and the howlings of the hopeless and the damned!|1|18|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
And there, too!|2|18|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
–there!|3|18|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
–upon the ottoman!|4|18|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
–who could he be?|5|18|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
–he, the petitmaitre–no, the Deity–who sat as if carved in marble, et qui sourit, with his pale countenance, si amerement?|6|18|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
Mais il faut agir–that is to say, a Frenchman never faints outright.|0|19|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
Besides, his Grace hated a scene–De L'Omelette is himself again.|1|19|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
There were some foils upon a table–some points also.|2|19|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
The Duc s'echapper.|3|19|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
He measures two points, and, with a grace inimitable, offers his Majesty the choice.|4|19|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
Horreur!|5|19|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor

Mais il joue!|0|20|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
–how happy a thought!|1|20|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
–but his Grace had always an excellent memory.|2|20|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
"He had dipped in the ""Diable"" of Abbe Gualtier."|3|20|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
"Therein it is said ""que le Diable n'ose pas refuser un jeu d'ecarte""."|4|20|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
But the chances–the chances!|0|21|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
True–desperate: but scarcely more desperate than the Duc.|1|21|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
Besides, was he not in the secret?|2|21|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
–had he not skimmed over Pere Le Brun?|3|21|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
–was he not a member of the Club Vingt-un?|4|21|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
"""Si je perds,"" said he, ""je serai deux fois perdu–I shall be doubly dammed–voila tout!"|5|21|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor

") Si je gagne, je reviendrai a mes ortolans–que les cartes soient preparees""!"|7|21|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
His Grace was all care, all attention–his Majesty all confidence.|0|22|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
A spectator would have thought of Francis and Charles.|1|22|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
His Grace thought of his game.|2|22|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
His Majesty did not think; he shuffled.|3|22|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
The Duc cut.|4|22|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
The cards were dealt.|0|23|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
The trump is turned–it is–it is–the king!|1|23|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
No–it was the queen.|2|23|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
His Majesty cursed her masculine habiliments.|3|23|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
De L'Omelette placed his hand upon his heart.|4|23|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
They play.|0|24|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
The Duc counts.|1|24|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
The hand is out.|2|24|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
His Majesty counts heavily, smiles, and is taking wine.|3|24|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
The Duc slips a card.|4|24|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
"""C'est a vous a faire,"" said his Majesty, cutting."|0|25|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
His Grace bowed, dealt, and arose from the table en presentant le Roi.|1|25|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
His Majesty looked chagrined.|0|26|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor
"Had Alexander not been Alexander, he would have been Diogenes; and the Duc assured his antagonist in taking leave, ""que s'il n'eut ete De L'Omelette il n'aurait point d'objection d'etre le Diable""."|0|27|The Duc De L'Omelette|March 3, 1832|Humor

"""LET us hurry to the walls,"" said Abel-Phittim to Buzi-Ben-Levi and Simeon the Pharisee, on the tenth day of the month Thammuz, in the year of the world three thousand nine hundred and forty-one–""let us hasten to the ramparts adjoining the gate of Benjamin, which is in the city of David, and overlooking the camp of the uncircumcised; for it is the last hour of the fourth watch, being sunrise; and the idolaters, in fulfilment of the promise of Pompey, should be awaiting us with the lambs for the sacrifices""."|0|2|A Tale Of Jerusalem|June 9, 1832|Humor
Simeon, Abel-Phittim, and Buzi-Ben-Levi, were the Gizbarim, or sub-collectors of the offering, in the holy city of Jerusalem.|0|3|A Tale Of Jerusalem|June 9, 1832|Humor
"""Verily,"" replied the Pharisee, ""let us hasten: for this generosity in the heathen is unwonted; and fickle-mindedness has ever been an attribute of the worshippers of Baal""."|0|4|A Tale Of Jerusalem|June 9, 1832|Humor
"""That they are fickle-minded and treacherous is as true as the Pentateuch,"" said Buzi-Ben-Levi, ""but that is only towards the people of Adonai."|0|5|A Tale Of Jerusalem|June 9, 1832|Humor
When was it ever known that the Ammonites proved wanting to their own interests?|1|5|A Tale Of Jerusalem|June 9, 1832|Humor
"Methinks it is no great stretch of generosity to allow us lambs for the altar of the Lord, receiving in lieu thereof thirty silver shekels per head""!"|2|5|A Tale Of Jerusalem|June 9, 1832|Humor
"""Thou forgettest, however, Ben-Levi,"" replied Abel-Phittim, ""that the Roman Pompey, who is now impiously besieging the city of the Most High, has no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus purchased for the altar, to the sustenance of the body, rather than of the spirit""."|0|6|A Tale Of Jerusalem|June 9, 1832|Humor
"""Now, by the five corners of my beard""!"|0|7|A Tale Of Jerusalem|June 9, 1832|Humor
"shouted the Pharisee, who belonged to the sect called The Dashers (that little knot of saints whose manner of dashing and lacerating the feet against the pavement was long a thorn and a reproach to less zealous devotees–a stumbling-block to less gifted perambulators)–""by the five corners of that beard which, as a priest, I am forbidden to shave!"|1|7|A Tale Of Jerusalem|June 9, 1832|Humor
–have we lived to see the day when a blaspheming and idolatrous upstart of Rome shall accuse us of appropriating to the appetites of the flesh the most holy and consecrated elements?|2|7|A Tale Of Jerusalem|June 9, 1832|Humor
"""Let us not question the motives of the Philistine,"" interrupted Abel-Phittim, ""for to-day we profit for the first time by his avarice or by his generosity, but rather let us hurry to the ramparts, lest offerings should be wanting for that altar whose fire the rains of heaven cannot extinguish, and whose pillars of smoke no tempest can turn aside""."|0|8|A Tale Of Jerusalem|June 9, 1832|Humor
That part of the city to which our worthy Gizbarin now hastened, and which bore the name of its architect, King David, was esteemed the most strongly fortified district of Jerusalem; being situated upon the steep and lofty hill of Zion.|0|9|A Tale Of Jerusalem|June 9, 1832|Humor
Here, a broad, deep, circumvallatory trench, hewn from the solid rock, was defended by a wall of great strength erected upon its inner edge.|1|9|A Tale Of Jerusalem|June 9, 1832|Humor
This wall was adorned, at regular interspaces, by square towers of white marble; the lowest sixty, and the highest one hundred and twenty cubits in height.|2|9|A Tale Of Jerusalem|June 9, 1832|Humor
But, in the vicinity of the gate of Benjamin, the wall arose by no means from the margin of the fosse.|3|9|A Tale Of Jerusalem|June 9, 1832|Humor
On the contrary, between the level of the ditch and the basement of the rampart, sprang up a perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty cubits, forming part of the precipitous Mount Moriah.|4|9|A Tale Of Jerusalem|June 9, 1832|Humor
So that when Simeon and his associates arrived on the summit of the tower called Adoni-Bezek–the loftiest of all the turrets around about Jerusalem, and the usual place of conference with the besieging army–they looked down upon the camp of the enemy from an eminence excelling by many feet that of the Pyramid of Cheops, and, by several, that of the temple of Belus.|5|9|A Tale Of Jerusalem|June 9, 1832|Humor
"""Verily,"" sighed the Pharisee, as he peered dizzly over the precipice, ""the uncircumcised are as the sands by the seashore–as the locusts in the wilderness!"|0|10|A Tale Of Jerusalem|June 9, 1832|Humor

"""Lower away the basket with the shekels of silver""!"|0|12|A Tale Of Jerusalem|June 9, 1832|Humor
"here shouted a Roman soldier in a hoarse, rough voice, which appeared to issue from the regions of Pluto–""lower away the basket with the accursed coin which it has broken the jaw of a noble Roman to pronounce!"|1|12|A Tale Of Jerusalem|June 9, 1832|Humor
Is it thus you evince your gratitude to our master Pompeius, who, in his condescension, has thought fit to listen to your idolatrous importunities?|2|12|A Tale Of Jerusalem|June 9, 1832|Humor
The god Phoebus, who is a true god, has been charioted for an hour–and were you not to be on the ramparts by sunrise?|3|12|A Tale Of Jerusalem|June 9, 1832|Humor

The main fury of the blast had already blown over, and we apprehended little danger from the violence of the wind; but we looked forward to its total cessation with dismay; well believing, that, in our shattered condition, we should inevitably perish in the tremendous swell which would ensue.|11|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
But this very just apprehension seemed by no means likely to be soon verified.|12|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
For five entire days and nights --during which our only subsistence was a small quantity of jaggeree, procured with great difficulty from the forecastle --the hulk flew at a rate defying computation, before rapidly succeeding flaws of wind, which, without equalling the first violence of the Simoom, were still more terrific than any tempest I had before encountered.|13|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure

--There were no clouds apparent, yet the wind was upon the increase, and blew with a fitful and unsteady fury.|17|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
About noon, as nearly as we could guess, our attention was again arrested by the appearance of the sun.|18|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
It gave out no light, properly so called, but a dull and sullen glow without reflection, as if all its rays were polarized.|19|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
Just before sinking within the turgid sea, its central fires suddenly went out, as if hurriedly extinguished by some unaccountable power.|20|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
It was a dim, sliver-like rim, alone, as it rushed down the unfathomable ocean.|21|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
We waited in vain for the arrival of the sixth day --that day to me has not arrived --to the Swede, never did arrive.|0|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
Thenceforward we were enshrouded in patchy darkness, so that we could not have seen an object at twenty paces from the ship.|1|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
Eternal night continued to envelop us, all unrelieved by the phosphoric sea-brilliancy to which we had been accustomed in the tropics.|2|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
We observed too, that, although the tempest continued to rage with unabated violence, there was no longer to be discovered the usual appearance of surf, or foam, which had hitherto attended us.|3|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
All around were horror, and thick gloom, and a black sweltering desert of ebony.|4|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
--Superstitious terror crept by degrees into the spirit of the old Swede, and my own soul was wrapped up in silent wonder.|5|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
We neglected all care of the ship, as worse than useless, and securing ourselves, as well as possible, to the stump of the mizen-mast, looked out bitterly into the world of ocean.|6|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
We had no means of calculating time, nor could we form any guess of our situation.|7|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
We were, however, well aware of having made farther to the southward than any previous navigators, and felt great amazement at not meeting with the usual impediments of ice.|8|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
In the meantime every moment threatened to be our last --every mountainous billow hurried to overwhelm us.|9|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
The swell surpassed anything I had imagined possible, and that we were not instantly buried is a miracle.|10|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
My companion spoke of the lightness of our cargo, and reminded me of the excellent qualities of our ship; but I could not help feeling the utter hopelessness of hope itself, and prepared myself gloomily for that death which I thought nothing could defer beyond an hour, as, with every knot of way the ship made, the swelling of the black stupendous seas became more dismally appalling.|11|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
At times we gasped for breath at an elevation beyond the albatross --at times became dizzy with the velocity of our descent into some watery hell, where the air grew stagnant, and no sound disturbed the slumbers of the kraken.|12|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
We were at the bottom of one of these abysses, when a quick scream from my companion broke fearfully upon the night.|0|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
"""See!"|1|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure

"see""!"|5|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
As he spoke, I became aware of a dull, sullen glare of red light which streamed down the sides of the vast chasm where we lay, and threw a fitful brilliancy upon our deck.|6|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
Casting my eyes upwards, I beheld a spectacle which froze the current of my blood.|7|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
At a terrific height directly above us, and upon the very verge of the precipitous descent, hovered a gigantic ship of, perhaps, four thousand tons.|8|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
Although upreared upon the summit of a wave more than a hundred times her own altitude, her apparent size exceeded that of any ship of the line or East Indiaman in existence.|9|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
Her huge hull was of a deep dingy black, unrelieved by any of the customary carvings of a ship.|10|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
A single row of brass cannon protruded from her open ports, and dashed from their polished surfaces the fires of innumerable battle-lanterns, which swung to and fro about her rigging.|11|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
But what mainly inspired us with horror and astonishment, was that she bore up under a press of sail in the very teeth of that supernatural sea, and of that ungovernable hurricane.|12|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
When we first discovered her, her bows were alone to be seen, as she rose slowly from the dim and horrible gulf beyond her.|13|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
For a moment of intense terror she paused upon the giddy pinnacle, as if in contemplation of her own sublimity, then trembled and tottered, and --came down.|14|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
At this instant, I know not what sudden self-possession came over my spirit.|0|10|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
Staggering as far aft as I could, I awaited fearlessly the ruin that was to overwhelm.|1|10|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
Our own vessel was at length ceasing from her struggles, and sinking with her head to the sea.|2|10|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
The shock of the descending mass struck her, consequently, in that portion of her frame which was already under water, and the inevitable result was to hurl me, with irresistible violence, upon the rigging of the stranger.|3|10|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
As I fell, the ship hove in stays, and went about; and to the confusion ensuing I attributed my escape from the notice of the crew.|0|11|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
With little difficulty I made my way unperceived to the main hatchway, which was partially open, and soon found an opportunity of secreting myself in the hold.|1|11|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
Why I did so I can hardly tell.|2|11|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
An indefinite sense of awe, which at first sight of the navigators of the ship had taken hold of my mind, was perhaps the principle of my concealment.|3|11|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
I was unwilling to trust myself with a race of people who had offered, to the cursory glance I had taken, so many points of vague novelty, doubt, and apprehension.|4|11|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
I therefore thought proper to contrive a hiding-place in the hold.|5|11|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
This I did by removing a small portion of the shifting-boards, in such a manner as to afford me a convenient retreat between the huge timbers of the ship.|6|11|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
I had scarcely completed my work, when a footstep in the hold forced me to make use of it.|0|12|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
A man passed by my place of concealment with a feeble and unsteady gait.|1|12|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
I could not see his face, but had an opportunity of observing his general appearance.|2|12|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
There was about it an evidence of great age and infirmity.|3|12|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
His knees tottered beneath a load of years, and his entire frame quivered under the burthen.|4|12|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
He muttered to himself, in a low broken tone, some words of a language which I could not understand, and groped in a corner among a pile of singular-looking instruments, and decayed charts of navigation.|5|12|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
His manner was a wild mixture of the peevishness of second childhood, and the solemn dignity of a God.|6|12|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
He at length went on deck, and I saw him no more.|7|12|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
A feeling, for which I have no name, has taken possession of my soul --a sensation which will admit of no analysis, to which the lessons of bygone times are inadequate, and for which I fear futurity itself will offer me no key.|0|13|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
To a mind constituted like my own, the latter consideration is an evil.|1|13|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
I shall never --I know that I shall never --be satisfied with regard to the nature of my conceptions.|2|13|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
Yet it is not wonderful that these conceptions are indefinite, since they have their origin in sources so utterly novel.|3|13|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
A new sense --a new entity is added to my soul.|4|13|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
It is long since I first trod the deck of this terrible ship, and the rays of my destiny are, I think, gathering to a focus.|0|14|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
Incomprehensible men!|1|14|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
Wrapped up in meditations of a kind which I cannot divine, they pass me by unnoticed.|2|14|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
Concealment is utter folly on my part, for the people will not see.|3|14|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
It was but just now that I passed directly before the eyes of the mate --it was no long while ago that I ventured into the captain's own private cabin, and took thence the materials with which I write, and have written.|4|14|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
I shall from time to time continue this Journal.|5|14|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
It is true that I may not find an opportunity of transmitting it to the world, but I will not fall to make the endeavour.|6|14|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
At the last moment I will enclose the MS.|7|14|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
in a bottle, and cast it within the sea.|8|14|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
An incident has occurred which has given me new room for meditation.|0|15|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
Are such things the operation of ungoverned Chance?|1|15|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
I had ventured upon deck and thrown myself down, without attracting any notice, among a pile of ratlin-stuff and old sails in the bottom of the yawl.|2|15|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
While musing upon the singularity of my fate, I unwittingly daubed with a tar-brush the edges of a neatly-folded studding-sail which lay near me on a barrel.|3|15|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
The studding-sail is now bent upon the ship, and the thoughtless touches of the brush are spread out into the word DISCOVERY.|4|15|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
I have made many observations lately upon the structure of the vessel.|0|16|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
Although well armed, she is not, I think, a ship of war.|1|16|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
Her rigging, build, and general equipment, all negative a supposition of this kind.|2|16|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
What she is not, I can easily perceive --what she is I fear it is impossible to say.|3|16|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
I know not how it is, but in scrutinizing her strange model and singular cast of spars, her huge size and overgrown suits of canvas, her severely simple bow and antiquated stern, there will occasionally flash across my mind a sensation of familiar things, and there is always mixed up with such indistinct shadows of recollection, an unaccountable memory of old foreign chronicles and ages long ago.|4|16|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
I have been looking at the timbers of the ship.|5|16|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
She is built of a material to which I am a stranger.|6|16|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
There is a peculiar character about the wood which strikes me as rendering it unfit for the purpose to which it has been applied.|7|16|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
I mean its extreme porousness, considered independently by the worm-eaten condition which is a consequence of navigation in these seas, and apart from the rottenness attendant upon age.|8|16|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
It will appear perhaps an observation somewhat over-curious, but this wood would have every, characteristic of Spanish oak, if Spanish oak were distended by any unnatural means.|9|16|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
In reading the above sentence a curious apothegm of an old weather-beaten Dutch navigator comes full upon my recollection.|0|17|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
"""It is as sure,"" he was wont to say, when any doubt was entertained of his veracity, ""as sure as there is a sea where the ship itself will grow in bulk like the living body of the seaman""."|1|17|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
About an hour ago, I made bold to thrust myself among a group of the crew.|0|18|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
They paid me no manner of attention, and, although I stood in the very midst of them all, seemed utterly unconscious of my presence.|1|18|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
Like the one I had at first seen in the hold, they all bore about them the marks of a hoary old age.|2|18|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
Their knees trembled with infirmity; their shoulders were bent double with decrepitude; their shrivelled skins rattled in the wind; their voices were low, tremulous and broken; their eyes glistened with the rheum of years; and their gray hairs streamed terribly in the tempest.|3|18|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
Around them, on every part of the deck, lay scattered mathematical instruments of the most quaint and obsolete construction.|4|18|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
I mentioned some time ago the bending of a studding-sail.|0|19|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
From that period the ship, being thrown dead off the wind, has continued her terrific course due south, with every rag of canvas packed upon her, from her trucks to her lower studding-sail booms, and rolling every moment her top-gallant yard-arms into the most appalling hell of water which it can enter into the mind of a man to imagine.|1|19|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
I have just left the deck, where I find it impossible to maintain a footing, although the crew seem to experience little inconvenience.|2|19|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
It appears to me a miracle of miracles that our enormous bulk is not swallowed up at once and forever.|3|19|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
We are surely doomed to hover continually upon the brink of Eternity, without taking a final plunge into the abyss.|4|19|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
From billows a thousand times more stupendous than any I have ever seen, we glide away with the facility of the arrowy sea-gull; and the colossal waters rear their heads above us like demons of the deep, but like demons confined to simple threats and forbidden to destroy.|5|19|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
I am led to attribute these frequent escapes to the only natural cause which can account for such effect.|6|19|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
--I must suppose the ship to be within the influence of some strong current, or impetuous under-tow.|7|19|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
I have seen the captain face to face, and in his own cabin --but, as I expected, he paid me no attention.|0|20|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
Although in his appearance there is, to a casual observer, nothing which might bespeak him more or less than man-still a feeling of irrepressible reverence and awe mingled with the sensation of wonder with which I regarded him.|1|20|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
In stature he is nearly my own height; that is, about five feet eight inches.|2|20|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
He is of a well-knit and compact frame of body, neither robust nor remarkably otherwise.|3|20|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
But it is the singularity of the expression which reigns upon the face --it is the intense, the wonderful, the thrilling evidence of old age, so utter, so extreme, which excites within my spirit a sense --a sentiment ineffable.|4|20|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
His forehead, although little wrinkled, seems to bear upon it the stamp of a myriad of years.|5|20|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
--His gray hairs are records of the past, and his grayer eyes are Sybils of the future.|6|20|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
The cabin floor was thickly strewn with strange, iron-clasped folios, and mouldering instruments of science, and obsolete long-forgotten charts.|7|20|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
His head was bowed down upon his hands, and he pored, with a fiery unquiet eye, over a paper which I took to be a commission, and which, at all events, bore the signature of a monarch.|8|20|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
He muttered to himself, as did the first seaman whom I saw in the hold, some low peevish syllables of a foreign tongue, and although the speaker was close at my elbow, his voice seemed to reach my ears from the distance of a mile.|9|20|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
The ship and all in it are imbued with the spirit of Eld.|0|21|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
The crew glide to and fro like the ghosts of buried centuries; their eyes have an eager and uneasy meaning; and when their fingers fall athwart my path in the wild glare of the battle-lanterns, I feel as I have never felt before, although I have been all my life a dealer in antiquities, and have imbibed the shadows of fAllan columns at Balbec, and Tadmor, and Persepolis, until my very soul has become a ruin.|1|21|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
When I look around me I feel ashamed of my former apprehensions.|0|22|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
If I trembled at the blast which has hitherto attended us, shall I not stand aghast at a warring of wind and ocean, to convey any idea of which the words tornado and simoom are trivial and ineffective?|1|22|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
All in the immediate vicinity of the ship is the blackness of eternal night, and a chaos of foamless water; but, about a league on either side of us, may be seen, indistinctly and at intervals, stupendous ramparts of ice, towering away into the desolate sky, and looking like the walls of the universe.|2|22|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
As I imagined, the ship proves to be in a current; if that appellation can properly be given to a tide which, howling and shrieking by the white ice, thunders on to the southward with a velocity like the headlong dashing of a cataract.|0|23|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
To conceive the horror of my sensations is, I presume, utterly impossible; yet a curiosity to penetrate the mysteries of these awful regions, predominates even over my despair, and will reconcile me to the most hideous aspect of death.|0|24|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
It is evident that we are hurrying onwards to some exciting knowledge --some never-to-be-imparted secret, whose attainment is destruction.|1|24|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
Perhaps this current leads us to the southern pole itself.|2|24|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
It must be confessed that a supposition apparently so wild has every probability in its favor.|3|24|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
The crew pace the deck with unquiet and tremulous step; but there is upon their countenances an expression more of the eagerness of hope than of the apathy of despair.|0|25|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
In the meantime the wind is still in our poop, and, as we carry a crowd of canvas, the ship is at times lifted bodily from out the sea --Oh, horror upon horror!|0|26|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
the ice opens suddenly to the right, and to the left, and we are whirling dizzily, in immense concentric circles, round and round the borders of a gigantic amphitheatre, the summit of whose walls is lost in the darkness and the distance.|1|26|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
But little time will be left me to ponder upon my destiny --the circles rapidly grow small --we are plunging madly within the grasp of the whirlpool --and amid a roaring, and bellowing, and thundering of ocean and of tempest, the ship is quivering, oh God!|2|26|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure
and --going down.|3|26|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure

"Found in a Bottle,"" was originally published in 1831 [1833], and it was not until many years afterwards that I became acquainted with the maps of Mercator, in which the ocean is represented as rushing, by four mouths, into the (northern) Polar Gulf, to be absorbed into the bowels of the earth; the Pole itself being represented by a black rock, towering to a prodigious height."|2|27|Ms. Found In A Bottle|October 19, 1833|Adventure

PLATO: SYMPOS.|1|0|Morella|April 1835|Horror
WITH a feeling of deep yet most singular affection I regarded my friend Morella.|0|1|Morella|April 1835|Horror
Thrown by accident into her society many years ago, my soul from our first meeting, burned with fires it had never before known; but the fires were not of Eros, and bitter and tormenting to my spirit was the gradual conviction that I could in no manner define their unusual meaning or regulate their vague intensity.|1|1|Morella|April 1835|Horror
Yet we met; and fate bound us together at the altar, and I never spoke of passion nor thought of love.|2|1|Morella|April 1835|Horror
She, however, shunned society, and, attaching herself to me alone rendered me happy.|3|1|Morella|April 1835|Horror
It is a happiness to wonder; it is a happiness to dream.|4|1|Morella|April 1835|Horror
Morella's erudition was profound.|0|2|Morella|April 1835|Horror
As I hope to live, her talents were of no common order–her powers of mind were gigantic.|1|2|Morella|April 1835|Horror
I felt this, and, in many matters, became her pupil.|2|2|Morella|April 1835|Horror
I soon, however, found that, perhaps on account of her Presburg education, she placed before me a number of those mystical writings which are usually considered the mere dross of the early German literature.|3|2|Morella|April 1835|Horror
These, for what reason I could not imagine, were her favourite and constant study–and that in process of time they became my own, should be attributed to the simple but effectual influence of habit and example.|4|2|Morella|April 1835|Horror
In all this, if I err not, my reason had little to do.|0|3|Morella|April 1835|Horror
My convictions, or I forget myself, were in no manner acted upon by the ideal, nor was any tincture of the mysticism which I read to be discovered, unless I am greatly mistaken, either in my deeds or in my thoughts.|1|3|Morella|April 1835|Horror
Persuaded of this, I abandoned myself implicitly to the guidance of my wife, and entered with an unflinching heart into the intricacies of her studies.|2|3|Morella|April 1835|Horror
And then–then, when poring over forbidden pages, I felt a forbidden spirit enkindling within me- would Morella place her cold hand upon my own, and rake up from the ashes of a dead philosophy some low, singular words, whose strange meaning burned themselves in upon my memory.|3|3|Morella|April 1835|Horror
And then, hour after hour, would I linger by her side, and dwell upon the music of her voice, until at length its melody was tainted with terror, and there fell a shadow upon my soul, and I grew pale, and shuddered inwardly at those too unearthly tones.|4|3|Morella|April 1835|Horror
And thus, joy suddenly faded into horror, and the most beautiful became the most hideous, as Hinnon became Ge-Henna.|5|3|Morella|April 1835|Horror
It is unnecessary to state the exact character of those disquisitions which, growing out of the volumes I have mentioned, formed, for so long a time, almost the sole conversation of Morella and myself.|0|4|Morella|April 1835|Horror
By the learned in what might be termed theological morality they will be readily conceived, and by the unlearned they would, at all events, be little understood.|1|4|Morella|April 1835|Horror
The wild Pantheism of Fichte; the modified Paliggenedia of the Pythagoreans; and, above all, the doctrines of Identity as urged by Schelling, were generally the points of discussion presenting the most of beauty to the imaginative Morella.|2|4|Morella|April 1835|Horror
That identity which is termed personal, Mr. Locke, I think, truly defines to consist in the saneness of rational being.|3|4|Morella|April 1835|Horror
And since by person we understand an intelligent essence having reason, and since there is a consciousness which always accompanies thinking, it is this which makes us all to be that which we call ourselves, thereby distinguishing us from other beings that think, and giving us our personal identity.|4|4|Morella|April 1835|Horror
But the principium indivduationis, the notion of that identity which at death is or is not lost for ever, was to me, at all times, a consideration of intense interest; not more from the perplexing and exciting nature of its consequences, than from the marked and agitated manner in which Morella mentioned them.|5|4|Morella|April 1835|Horror
But, indeed, the time had now arrived when the mystery of my wife's manner oppressed me as a spell.|0|5|Morella|April 1835|Horror
I could no longer bear the touch of her wan fingers, nor the low tone of her musical language, nor the lustre of her melancholy eyes.|1|5|Morella|April 1835|Horror
And she knew all this, but did not upbraid; she seemed conscious of my weakness or my folly, and, smiling, called it fate.|2|5|Morella|April 1835|Horror
She seemed also conscious of a cause, to me unknown, for the gradual alienation of my regard; but she gave me no hint or token of its nature.|3|5|Morella|April 1835|Horror
Yet was she woman, and pined away daily.|4|5|Morella|April 1835|Horror
In time the crimson spot settled steadily upon the cheek, and the blue veins upon the pale forehead became prominent; and one instant my nature melted into pity, but in, next I met the glance of her meaning eyes, and then my soul sickened and became giddy with the giddiness of one who gazes downward into some dreary and unfathomable abyss.|5|5|Morella|April 1835|Horror
Shall I then say that I longed with an earnest and consuming desire for the moment of Morella's decease?|0|6|Morella|April 1835|Horror
I did; but the fragile spirit clung to its tenement of clay for many days, for many weeks and irksome months, until my tortured nerves obtained the mastery over my mind, and I grew furious through delay, and, with the heart of a fiend, cursed the days and the hours and the bitter moments, which seemed to lengthen and lengthen as her gentle life declined, like shadows in the dying of the day.|1|6|Morella|April 1835|Horror
But one autumnal evening, when the winds lay still in heaven, Morella called me to her bedside.|0|7|Morella|April 1835|Horror
There was a dim mist over all the earth, and a warm glow upon the waters, and amid the rich October leaves of the forest, a rainbow from the firmament had surely fAllan.|1|7|Morella|April 1835|Horror
"""It is a day of days,"" she said, as I approached; ""a day of all days either to live or die."|0|8|Morella|April 1835|Horror
"It is a fair day for the sons of earth and life–ah, more fair for the daughters of heaven and death""!"|1|8|Morella|April 1835|Horror
"""I am dying, yet shall I live""."|0|10|Morella|April 1835|Horror
"""Morella""!"|0|11|Morella|April 1835|Horror
"""The days have never been when thou couldst love me–but her whom in life thou didst abhor, in death thou shalt adore""."|0|12|Morella|April 1835|Horror
"""Morella""!"|0|13|Morella|April 1835|Horror
"""I repeat I am dying."|0|14|Morella|April 1835|Horror
But within me is a pledge of that affection- ah, how little!|1|14|Morella|April 1835|Horror
–which thou didst feel for me, Morella.|2|14|Morella|April 1835|Horror
And when my spirit departs shall the child live–thy child and mine, Morella's.|3|14|Morella|April 1835|Horror
But thy days shall be days of sorrow–that sorrow which is the most lasting of impressions, as the cypress is the most enduring of trees.|4|14|Morella|April 1835|Horror
For the hours of thy happiness are over and joy is not gathered twice in a life, as the roses of Paestum twice in a year.|5|14|Morella|April 1835|Horror
"Thou shalt no longer, then, play the Teian with time, but, being ignorant of the myrtle and the vine, thou shalt bear about with thee thy shroud on the earth, as do the Moslemin at Mecca""."|6|14|Morella|April 1835|Horror
"""Morella""!"|0|15|Morella|April 1835|Horror
"I cried, ""Morella!"|1|15|Morella|April 1835|Horror
"how knowest thou this""?"|2|15|Morella|April 1835|Horror
but she turned away her face upon the pillow and a slight tremor coming over her limbs, she thus died, and I heard her voice no more.|3|15|Morella|April 1835|Horror
Yet, as she had foretold, her child, to which in dying she had given birth, which breathed not until the mother breathed no more, her child, a daughter, lived.|0|16|Morella|April 1835|Horror
And she grew strangely in stature and intellect, and was the perfect resemblance of her who had departed, and I loved her with a love more fervent than I had believed it possible to feel for any denizen of earth.|1|16|Morella|April 1835|Horror
But, ere long the heaven of this pure affection became darkened, and gloom, and horror, and grief swept over it in clouds.|0|17|Morella|April 1835|Horror
I said the child grew strangely in stature and intelligence.|1|17|Morella|April 1835|Horror
Strange, indeed, was her rapid increase in bodily size, but terrible, oh!|2|17|Morella|April 1835|Horror
terrible were the tumultuous thoughts which crowded upon me while watching the development of her mental being.|3|17|Morella|April 1835|Horror
Could it be otherwise, when I daily discovered in the conceptions of the child the adult powers and faculties of the woman?|4|17|Morella|April 1835|Horror
when the lessons of experience fell from the lips of infancy?|5|17|Morella|April 1835|Horror
and when the wisdom or the passions of maturity I found hourly gleaming from its full and speculative eye?|6|17|Morella|April 1835|Horror
When, I say, all this beeame evident to my appalled senses, when I could no longer hide it from my soul, nor throw it off from those perceptions which trembled to receive it, is it to be wondered at that suspicions, of a nature fearful and exciting, crept in upon my spirit, or that my thoughts fell back aghast upon the wild tales and thrilling theories of the entombed Morella?|7|17|Morella|April 1835|Horror
I snatched from the scrutiny of the world a being whom destiny compelled me to adore, and in the rigorous seclusion of my home, watched with an agonizing anxiety over all which concerned the beloved.|8|17|Morella|April 1835|Horror
And as years rolled away, and I gazed day after day upon her holy, and mild, and eloquent face, and poured over her maturing form, day after day did I discover new points of resemblance in the child to her mother, the melancholy and the dead.|0|18|Morella|April 1835|Horror
And hourly grew darker these shadows of similitude, and more full, and more definite, and more perplexing, and more hideously terrible in their aspect.|1|18|Morella|April 1835|Horror
For that her smile was like her mother's I could bear; but then I shuddered at its too perfect identity, that her eyes were like Morella's I could endure; but then they, too, often looked down into the depths of my soul with Morella's own intense and bewildering meaning.|2|18|Morella|April 1835|Horror
And in the contour of the high forehead, and in the ringlets of the silken hair, and in the wan fingers which buried themselves therein, and in the sad musical tones of her speech, and above all–oh, above all, in the phrases and expressions of the dead on the lips of the loved and the living, I found food for consuming thought and horror, for a worm that would not die.|3|18|Morella|April 1835|Horror
Thus passed away two lustra of her life, and as yet my daughter remained nameless upon the earth.|0|19|Morella|April 1835|Horror
"""My child,"" and ""my love,"" were the designations usually prompted by a father's affection, and the rigid seclusion of her days precluded all other intercourse."|1|19|Morella|April 1835|Horror
Morella's name died with her at her death.|2|19|Morella|April 1835|Horror
Of the mother I had never spoken to the daughter, it was impossible to speak.|3|19|Morella|April 1835|Horror
Indeed, during the brief period of her existence, the latter had received no impressions from the outward world, save such as might have been afforded by the narrow limits of her privacy.|4|19|Morella|April 1835|Horror
But at length the ceremony of baptism presented to my mind, in its unnerved and agitated condition, a present deliverance from the terrors of my destiny.|5|19|Morella|April 1835|Horror
And at the baptismal font I hesitated for a name.|6|19|Morella|April 1835|Horror
And many titles of the wise and beautiful, of old and modern times, of my own and foreign lands, came thronging to my lips, with many, many fair titles of the gentle, and the happy, and the good.|7|19|Morella|April 1835|Horror
What prompted me then to disturb the memory of the buried dead?|8|19|Morella|April 1835|Horror
What demon urged me to breathe that sound, which in its very recollection was wont to make ebb the purple blood in torrents from the temples to the heart?|9|19|Morella|April 1835|Horror
What fiend spoke from the recesses of my soul, when amid those dim aisles, and in the silence of the night, I whispered within the ears of the holy man the syllables–Morella?|10|19|Morella|April 1835|Horror
"What more than fiend convulsed the features of my child, and overspread them with hues of death, as starting at that scarcely audible sound, she turned her glassy eyes from the earth to heaven, and falling prostrate on the black slabs of our ancestral vault, responded–""I am here""!"|11|19|Morella|April 1835|Horror
Distinct, coldly, calmly distinct, fell those few simple sounds within my ear, and thence like molten lead rolled hissingly into my brain.|0|20|Morella|April 1835|Horror
Years–years may pass away, but the memory of that epoch never.|1|20|Morella|April 1835|Horror
Nor was I indeed ignorant of the flowers and the vine–but the hemlock and the cypress overshadowed me night and day.|2|20|Morella|April 1835|Horror
And I kept no reckoning of time or place, and the stars of my fate faded from heaven, and therefore the earth grew dark, and its figures passed by me like flitting shadows, and among them all I beheld only–Morella.|3|20|Morella|April 1835|Horror
The winds of the firmament breathed but one sound within my ears, and the ripples upon the sea murmured evermore–Morella.|4|20|Morella|April 1835|Horror
But she died; and with my own hands I bore her to the tomb; and I laughed with a long and bitter laugh as I found no traces of the first in the channel where I laid the second.|5|20|Morella|April 1835|Horror
–Morella.|6|20|Morella|April 1835|Horror

By late accounts from Rotterdam, that city seems to be in a high state of philosophical excitement.|0|1|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Indeed, phenomena have there occurred of a nature so completely unexpected–so entirely novel–so utterly at variance with preconceived opinions–as to leave no doubt on my mind that long ere this all Europe is in an uproar, all physics in a ferment, all reason and astronomy together by the ears.|1|1|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
date), a vast crowd of people, for purposes not specifically mentioned, were assembled in the great square of the Exchange in the well-conditioned city of Rotterdam.|2|1|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The day was warm–unusually so for the season–there was hardly a breath of air stirring; and the multitude were in no bad humor at being now and then besprinkled with friendly showers of momentary duration, that fell from large white masses of cloud which chequered in a fitful manner the blue vault of the firmament.|3|1|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Nevertheless, about noon, a slight but remarkable agitation became apparent in the assembly: the clattering of ten thousand tongues succeeded; and, in an instant afterward, ten thousand faces were upturned toward the heavens, ten thousand pipes descended simultaneously from the corners of ten thousand mouths, and a shout, which could be compared to nothing but the roaring of Niagara, resounded long, loudly, and furiously, through all the environs of Rotterdam.|4|1|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The origin of this hubbub soon became sufficiently evident.|0|2|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
From behind the huge bulk of one of those sharply-defined masses of cloud already mentioned, was seen slowly to emerge into an open area of blue space, a queer, heterogeneous, but apparently solid substance, so oddly shaped, so whimsically put together, as not to be in any manner comprehended, and never to be sufficiently admired, by the host of sturdy burghers who stood open-mouthed below.|1|2|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
What could it be?|2|2|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In the name of all the vrows and devils in Rotterdam, what could it possibly portend?|3|2|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
No one knew, no one could imagine; no one–not even the burgomaster Mynheer Superbus Von Underduk–had the slightest clew by which to unravel the mystery; so, as nothing more reasonable could be done, every one to a man replaced his pipe carefully in the corner of his mouth, and cocking up his right eye towards the phenomenon, puffed, paused, waddled about, and grunted significantly- then waddled back, grunted, paused, and finally–puffed again.|4|2|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In the meantime, however, lower and still lower toward the goodly city, came the object of so much curiosity, and the cause of so much smoke.|0|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In a very few minutes it arrived near enough to be accurately discerned.|1|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It appeared to be–yes!|2|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
it was undoubtedly a species of balloon; but surely no such balloon had ever been seen in Rotterdam before.|3|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
For who, let me ask, ever heard of a balloon manufactured entirely of dirty newspapers?|4|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
No man in Holland certainly; yet here, under the very noses of the people, or rather at some distance above their noses was the identical thing in question, and composed, I have it on the best authority, of the precise material which no one had ever before known to be used for a similar purpose.|5|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It was an egregious insult to the good sense of the burghers of Rotterdam.|6|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
As to the shape of the phenomenon, it was even still more reprehensible.|7|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure

And this similitude was regarded as by no means lessened when, upon nearer inspection, there was perceived a large tassel depending from its apex, and, around the upper rim or base of the cone, a circle of little instruments, resembling sheep-bells, which kept up a continual tinkling to the tune of Betty Martin.|9|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But still worse.|10|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Suspended by blue ribbons to the end of this fantastic machine, there hung, by way of car, an enormous drab beaver bat, with a brim superlatively broad, and a hemispherical crown with a black band and a silver buckle.|11|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It is, however, somewhat remarkable that many citizens of Rotterdam swore to having seen the same hat repeatedly before; and indeed the whole assembly seemed to regard it with eyes of familiarity; while the vrow Grettel Phaall, upon sight of it, uttered an exclamation of joyful surprise, and declared it to be the identical hat of her good man himself.|12|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Now this was a circumstance the more to be observed, as Phaall, with three companions, had actually disappeared from Rotterdam about five years before, in a very sudden and unaccountable manner, and up to the date of this narrative all attempts had failed of obtaining any intelligence concerning them whatsoever.|13|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
To be sure, some bones which were thought to be human, mixed up with a quantity of odd-looking rubbish, had been lately discovered in a retired situation to the east of Rotterdam, and some people went so far as to imagine that in this spot a foul murder had been committed, and that the sufferers were in all probability Hans Phaall and his associates.|14|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure

This was in truth a very droll little somebody.|1|4|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
He could not have been more than two feet in height; but this altitude, little as it was, would have been sufficient to destroy his equilibrium, and tilt him over the edge of his tiny car, but for the intervention of a circular rim reaching as high as the breast, and rigged on to the cords of the balloon.|2|4|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The body of the little man was more than proportionately broad, giving to his entire figure a rotundity highly absurd.|3|4|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
His feet, of course, could not be seen at all, although a horny substance of suspicious nature was occasionally protruded through a rent in the bottom of the car, or to speak more properly, in the top of the hat.|4|4|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
His hands were enormously large.|5|4|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
His hair was extremely gray, and collected in a cue behind.|6|4|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
His nose was prodigiously long, crooked, and inflammatory; his eyes full, brilliant, and acute; his chin and cheeks, although wrinkled with age, were broad, puffy, and double; but of ears of any kind or character there was not a semblance to be discovered upon any portion of his head.|7|4|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This odd little gentleman was dressed in a loose surtout of sky-blue satin, with tight breeches to match, fastened with silver buckles at the knees.|8|4|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
His vest was of some bright yellow material; a white taffety cap was set jauntily on one side of his head; and, to complete his equipment, a blood-red silk handkerchief enveloped his throat, and fell down, in a dainty manner, upon his bosom, in a fantastic bow-knot of super-eminent dimensions.|9|4|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Having descended, as I said before, to about one hundred feet from the surface of the earth, the little old gentleman was suddenly seized with a fit of trepidation, and appeared disinclined to make any nearer approach to terra firma.|0|5|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Throwing out, therefore, a quantity of sand from a canvas bag, which, he lifted with great difficulty, he became stationary in an instant.|1|5|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
He then proceeded, in a hurried and agitated manner, to extract from a side-pocket in his surtout a large morocco pocket-book.|2|5|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This he poised suspiciously in his hand, then eyed it with an air of extreme surprise, and was evidently astonished at its weight.|3|5|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
He at length opened it, and drawing there from a huge letter sealed with red sealing-wax and tied carefully with red tape, let it fall precisely at the feet of the burgomaster, Superbus Von Underduk.|4|5|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
His Excellency stooped to take it up.|5|5|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But the aeronaut, still greatly discomposed, and having apparently no farther business to detain him in Rotterdam, began at this moment to make busy preparations for departure; and it being necessary to discharge a portion of ballast to enable him to reascend, the half dozen bags which he threw out, one after another, without taking the trouble to empty their contents, tumbled, every one of them, most unfortunately upon the back of the burgomaster, and rolled him over and over no less than one-and-twenty times, in the face of every man in Rotterdam.|6|5|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It is not to be supposed, however, that the great Underduk suffered this impertinence on the part of the little old man to pass off with impunity.|7|5|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It is said, on the contrary, that during each and every one of his one-and twenty circumvolutions he emitted no less than one-and-twenty distinct and furious whiffs from his pipe, to which he held fast the whole time with all his might, and to which he intends holding fast until the day of his death.|8|5|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In the meantime the balloon arose like a lark, and, soaring far away above the city, at length drifted quietly behind a cloud similar to that from which it had so oddly emerged, and was thus lost forever to the wondering eyes of the good citiezns of Rotterdam.|0|6|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
All attention was now directed to the letter, the descent of which, and the consequences attending thereupon, had proved so fatally subversive of both person and personal dignity to his Excellency, the illustrious Burgomaster Mynheer Superbus Von Underduk.|1|6|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
That functionary, however, had not failed, during his circumgyratory movements, to bestow a thought upon the important subject of securing the packet in question, which was seen, upon inspection, to have fAllan into the most proper hands, being actually addressed to himself and Professor Rub-a-dub, in their official capacities of President and Vice-President of the Rotterdam College of Astronomy.|2|6|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It was accordingly opened by those dignitaries upon the spot, and found to contain the following extraordinary, and indeed very serious, communications.|3|6|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
To their Excellencies Von Underduk and Rub-a-dub, President and Vice-President of the States' College of Astronomers, in the city of Rotterdam.|0|7|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Your Excellencies may perhaps be able to remember an humble artizan, by name Hans Phaall, and by occupation a mender of bellows, who, with three others, disappeared from Rotterdam, about five years ago, in a manner which must have been considered by all parties at once sudden, and extremely unaccountable.|0|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
If, however, it so please your Excellencies, I, the writer of this communication, am the identical Hans Phaall himself.|1|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It is well known to most of my fellow citizens, that for the period of forty years I continued to occupy the little square brick building, at the head of the alley called Sauerkraut, in which I resided at the time of my disappearance.|2|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
My ancestors have also resided therein time out of mind–they, as well as myself, steadily following the respectable and indeed lucrative profession of mending of bellows.|3|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
For, to speak the truth, until of late years, that the heads of all the people have been set agog with politics, no better business than my own could an honest citizen of Rotterdam either desire or deserve.|4|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Credit was good, employment was never wanting, and on all hands there was no lack of either money or good-will.|5|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But, as I was saying, we soon began to feel the effects of liberty and long speeches, and radicalism, and all that sort of thing.|6|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
People who were formerly, the very best customers in the world, had now not a moment of time to think of us at all.|7|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
They had, so they said, as much as they could do to read about the revolutions, and keep up with the march of intellect and the spirit of the age.|8|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
If a fire wanted fanning, it could readily be fanned with a newspaper, and as the government grew weaker, I have no doubt that leather and iron acquired durability in proportion, for, in a very short time, there was not a pair of bellows in all Rotterdam that ever stood in need of a stitch or required the assistance of a hammer.|9|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This was a state of things not to be endured.|10|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I soon grew as poor as a rat, and, having a wife and children to provide for, my burdens at length became intolerable, and I spent hour after hour in reflecting upon the most convenient method of putting an end to my life.|11|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Duns, in the meantime, left me little leisure for contemplation.|12|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
My house was literally besieged from morning till night, so that I began to rave, and foam, and fret like a caged tiger against the bars of his enclosure.|13|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
There were three fellows in particular who worried me beyond endurance, keeping watch continually about my door, and threatening me with the law.|14|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Upon these three I internally vowed the bitterest revenge, if ever I should be so happy as to get them within my clutches; and I believe nothing in the world but the pleasure of this anticipation prevented me from putting my plan of suicide into immediate execution, by blowing my brains out with a blunderbuss.|15|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I thought it best, however, to dissemble my wrath, and to treat them with promises and fair words, until, by some good turn of fate, an opportunity of vengeance should be afforded me.|16|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
One day, having given my creditors the slip, and feeling more than usually dejected, I continued for a long time to wander about the most obscure streets without object whatever, until at length I chanced to stumble against the corner of a bookseller's stall.|0|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Seeing a chair close at hand, for the use of customers, I threw myself doggedly into it, and, hardly knowing why, opened the pages of the first volume which came within my reach.|1|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It proved to be a small pamphlet treatise on Speculative Astronomy, written either by Professor Encke of Berlin or by a Frenchman of somewhat similar name.|2|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I had some little tincture of information on matters of this nature, and soon became more and more absorbed in the contents of the book, reading it actually through twice before I awoke to a recollection of what was passing around me.|3|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
By this time it began to grow dark, and I directed my steps toward home.|4|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But the treatise had made an indelible impression on my mind, and, as I sauntered along the dusky streets, I revolved carefully over in my memory the wild and sometimes unintelligible reasonings of the writer.|5|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
There are some particular passages which affected my imagination in a powerful and extraordinary manner.|6|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The longer I meditated upon these the more intense grew the interest which had been excited within me.|7|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The limited nature of my education in general, and more especially my ignorance on subjects connected with natural philosophy, so far from rendering me diffident of my own ability to comprehend what I had read, or inducing me to mistrust the many vague notions which had arisen in consequence, merely served as a farther stimulus to imagination; and I was vain enough, or perhaps reasonable enough, to doubt whether those crude ideas which, arising in ill-regulated minds, have all the appearance, may not often in effect possess all the force, the reality, and other inherent properties, of instinct or intuition; whether, to proceed a step farther, profundity itself might not, in matters of a purely speculative nature, be detected as a legitimate source of falsity and error.|8|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In other words, I believed, and still do believe, that truth, is frequently of its own essence, superficial, and that, in many cases, the depth lies more in the abysses where we seek her, than in the actual situations wherein she may be found.|9|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Nature herself seemed to afford me corroboration of these ideas.|10|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In the contemplation of the heavenly bodies it struck me forcibly that I could not distinguish a star with nearly as much precision, when I gazed on it with earnest, direct and undeviating attention, as when I suffered my eye only to glance in its vicinity alone.|11|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I was not, of course, at that time aware that this apparent paradox was occasioned by the center of the visual area being less susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the exterior portions of the retina.|12|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This knowledge, and some of another kind, came afterwards in the course of an eventful five years, during which I have dropped the prejudices of my former humble situation in life, and forgotten the bellows-mender in far different occupations.|13|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But at the epoch of which I speak, the analogy which a casual observation of a star offered to the conclusions I had already drawn, struck me with the force of positive conformation, and I then finally made up my mind to the course which I afterwards pursued.|14|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It was late when I reached home, and I went immediately to bed.|0|10|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
My mind, however, was too much occupied to sleep, and I lay the whole night buried in meditation.|1|10|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Arising early in the morning, and contriving again to escape the vigilance of my creditors, I repaired eagerly to the bookseller's stall, and laid out what little ready money I possessed, in the purchase of some volumes of Mechanics and Practical Astronomy.|2|10|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Having arrived at home safely with these, I devoted every spare moment to their perusal, and soon made such proficiency in studies of this nature as I thought sufficient for the execution of my plan.|3|10|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In the intervals of this period, I made every endeavor to conciliate the three creditors who had given me so much annoyance.|4|10|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In this I finally succeeded–partly by selling enough of my household furniture to satisfy a moiety of their claim, and partly by a promise of paying the balance upon completion of a little project which I told them I had in view, and for assistance in which I solicited their services.|5|10|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
By these means–for they were ignorant men–I found little difficulty in gaining them over to my purpose.|6|10|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Matters being thus arranged, I contrived, by the aid of my wife and with the greatest secrecy and caution, to dispose of what property I had remaining, and to borrow, in small sums, under various pretences, and without paying any attention to my future means of repayment, no inconsiderable quantity of ready money.|0|11|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
With the means thus accruing I proceeded to procure at intervals, cambric muslin, very fine, in pieces of twelve yards each; twine; a lot of the varnish of caoutchouc; a large and deep basket of wicker-work, made to order; and several other articles necessary in the construction and equipment of a balloon of extraordinary dimensions.|1|11|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This I directed my wife to make up as soon as possible, and gave her all requisite information as to the particular method of proceeding.|2|11|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In the meantime I worked up the twine into a net-work of sufficient dimensions; rigged it with a hoop and the necessary cords; bought a quadrant, a compass, a spy-glass, a common barometer with some important modifications, and two astronomical instruments not so generally known.|3|11|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I then took opportunities of conveying by night, to a retired situation east of Rotterdam, five iron-bound casks, to contain about fifty gallons each, and one of a larger size; six tinned ware tubes, three inches in diameter, properly shaped, and ten feet in length; a quantity of a particular metallic substance, or semi-metal, which I shall not name, and a dozen demijohns of a very common acid.|4|11|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The gas to be formed from these latter materials is a gas never yet generated by any other person than myself–or at least never applied to any similar purpose.|5|11|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The secret I would make no difficulty in disclosing, but that it of right belongs to a citizen of Nantz, in France, by whom it was conditionally communicated to myself.|6|11|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The same individual submitted to me, without being at all aware of my intentions, a method of constructing balloons from the membrane of a certain animal, through which substance any escape of gas was nearly an impossibility.|7|11|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I found it, however, altogether too expensive, and was not sure, upon the whole, whether cambric muslin with a coating of gum caoutchouc, was not equally as good.|8|11|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I mention this circumstance, because I think it probable that hereafter the individual in question may attempt a balloon ascension with the novel gas and material I have spoken of, and I do not wish to deprive him of the honor of a very singular invention.|9|11|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
On the spot which I intended each of the smaller casks to occupy respectively during the inflation of the balloon, I privately dug a hole two feet deep; the holes forming in this manner a circle twenty-five feet in diameter.|0|12|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In the centre of this circle, being the station designed for the large cask, I also dug a hole three feet in depth.|1|12|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In each of the five smaller holes, I deposited a canister containing fifty pounds, and in the larger one a keg holding one hundred and fifty pounds, of cannon powder.|2|12|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
These–the keg and canisters–I connected in a proper manner with covered trains; and having let into one of the canisters the end of about four feet of slow match, I covered up the hole, and placed the cask over it, leaving the other end of the match protruding about an inch, and barely visible beyond the cask.|3|12|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I then filled up the remaining holes, and placed the barrels over them in their destined situation.|4|12|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Besides the articles above enumerated, I conveyed to the depot, and there secreted, one of M. Grimm's improvements upon the apparatus for condensation of the atmospheric air.|0|13|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I found this machine, however, to require considerable alteration before it could be adapted to the purposes to which I intended making it applicable.|1|13|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But, with severe labor and unremitting perseverance, I at length met with entire success in all my preparations.|2|13|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
My balloon was soon completed.|3|13|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It would contain more than forty thousand cubic feet of gas; would take me up easily, I calculated, with all my implements, and, if I managed rightly, with one hundred and seventy-five pounds of ballast into the bargain.|4|13|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It had received three coats of varnish, and I found the cambric muslin to answer all the purposes of silk itself, quite as strong and a good deal less expensive.|5|13|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Everything being now ready, I exacted from my wife an oath of secrecy in relation to all my actions from the day of my first visit to the bookseller's stall; and promising, on my part, to return as soon as circumstances would permit, I gave her what little money I had left, and bade her farewell.|0|14|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Indeed I had no fear on her account.|1|14|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
She was what people call a notable woman, and could manage matters in the world without my assistance.|2|14|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I believe, to tell the truth, she always looked upon me as an idle boy, a mere make-weight, good for nothing but building castles in the air, and was rather glad to get rid of me.|3|14|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It was a dark night when I bade her good-bye, and taking with me, as aides-de-camp, the three creditors who had given me so much trouble, we carried the balloon, with the car and accoutrements, by a roundabout way, to the station where the other articles were deposited.|4|14|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
We there found them all unmolested, and I proceeded immediately to business.|5|14|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It was the first of April.|0|15|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The night, as I said before, was dark; there was not a star to be seen; and a drizzling rain, falling at intervals, rendered us very uncomfortable.|1|15|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But my chief anxiety was concerning the balloon, which, in spite of the varnish with which it was defended, began to grow rather heavy with the moisture; the powder also was liable to damage.|2|15|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I therefore kept my three duns working with great diligence, pounding down ice around the central cask, and stirring the acid in the others.|3|15|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
They did not cease, however, importuning me with questions as to what I intended to do with all this apparatus, and expressed much dissatisfaction at the terrible labor I made them undergo.|4|15|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
They could not perceive, so they said, what good was likely to result from their getting wet to the skin, merely to take a part in such horrible incantations.|5|15|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I began to get uneasy, and worked away with all my might, for I verily believe the idiots supposed that I had entered into a compact with the devil, and that, in short, what I was now doing was nothing better than it should be.|6|15|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I was, therefore, in great fear of their leaving me altogether.|7|15|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I contrived, however, to pacify them by promises of payment of all scores in full, as soon as I could bring the present business to a termination.|8|15|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
To these speeches they gave, of course, their own interpretation; fancying, no doubt, that at all events I should come into possession of vast quantities of ready money; and provided I paid them all I owed, and a trifle more, in consideration of their services, I dare say they cared very little what became of either my soul or my carcass.|9|15|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In about four hours and a half I found the balloon sufficiently inflated.|0|16|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I attached the car, therefore, and put all my implements in it–not forgetting the condensing apparatus, a copious supply of water, and a large quantity of provisions, such as pemmican, in which much nutriment is contained in comparatively little bulk.|1|16|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I also secured in the car a pair of pigeons and a cat.|2|16|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It was now nearly daybreak, and I thought it high time to take my departure.|3|16|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Dropping a lighted cigar on the ground, as if by accident, I took the opportunity, in stooping to pick it up, of igniting privately the piece of slow match, whose end, as I said before, protruded a very little beyond the lower rim of one of the smaller casks.|4|16|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This manoeuvre was totally unperceived on the part of the three duns; and, jumping into the car, I immediately cut the single cord which held me to the earth, and was pleased to find that I shot upward, carrying with all ease one hundred and seventy-five pounds of leaden ballast, and able to have carried up as many more.|5|16|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Scarcely, however, had I attained the height of fifty yards, when, roaring and rumbling up after me in the most horrible and tumultuous manner, came so dense a hurricane of fire, and smoke, and sulphur, and legs and arms, and gravel, and burning wood, and blazing metal, that my very heart sunk within me, and I fell down in the bottom of the car, trembling with unmitigated terror.|0|17|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Indeed, I now perceived that I had entirely overdone the business, and that the main consequences of the shock were yet to be experienced.|1|17|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Accordingly, in less than a second, I felt all the blood in my body rushing to my temples, and immediately thereupon, a concussion, which I shall never forget, burst abruptly through the night and seemed to rip the very firmament asunder.|2|17|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
When I afterward had time for reflection, I did not fail to attribute the extreme violence of the explosion, as regarded myself, to its proper cause–my situation directly above it, and in the line of its greatest power.|3|17|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But at the time, I thought only of preserving my life.|4|17|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The balloon at first collapsed, then furiously expanded, then whirled round and round with horrible velocity, and finally, reeling and staggering like a drunken man, hurled me with great force over the rim of the car, and left me dangling, at a terrific height, with my head downward, and my face outwards, by a piece of slender cord about three feet in length, which hung accidentally through a crevice near the bottom of the wicker-work, and in which, as I fell, my left foot became most providentially entangled.|5|17|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It is impossible–utterly impossible–to form any adequate idea of the horror of my situation.|6|17|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I gasped convulsively for breath–a shudder resembling a fit of the ague agitated every nerve and muscle of my frame–I felt my eyes starting from their sockets–a horrible nausea overwhelmed me–and at length I fainted away.|7|17|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
How long I remained in this state it is impossible to say.|0|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It must, however, have been no inconsiderable time, for when I partially recovered the sense of existence, I found the day breaking, the balloon at a prodigious height over a wilderness of ocean, and not a trace of land to be discovered far and wide within the limits of the vast horizon.|1|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
My sensations, however, upon thus recovering, were by no means so rife with agony as might have been anticipated.|2|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Indeed, there was much of incipient madness in the calm survey which I began to take of my situation.|3|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I drew up to my eyes each of my hands, one after the other, and wondered what occurrence could have given rise to the swelling of the veins, and the horrible blackness of the fingemails.|4|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I afterward carefully examined my head, shaking it repeatedly, and feeling it with minute attention, until I succeeded in satisfying myself that it was not, as I had more than half suspected, larger than my balloon.|5|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Then, in a knowing manner, I felt in both my breeches pockets, and, missing therefrom a set of tablets and a toothpick case, endeavored to account for their disappearance, and not being able to do so, felt inexpressibly chagrined.|6|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It now occurred to me that I suffered great uneasiness in the joint of my left ankle, and a dim consciousness of my situation began to glimmer through my mind.|7|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But, strange to say!|8|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I was neither astonished nor horror-stricken.|9|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
If I felt any emotion at all, it was a kind of chuckling satisfaction at the cleverness I was about to display in extricating myself from this dilemma; and I never, for a moment, looked upon my ultimate safety as a question susceptible of doubt.|10|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
For a few minutes I remained wrapped in the profoundest meditation.|11|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I have a distinct recollection of frequently compressing my lips, putting my forefinger to the side of my nose, and making use of other gesticulations and grimaces common to men who, at ease in their arm-chairs, meditate upon matters of intricacy or importance.|12|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Having, as I thought, sufficiently collected my ideas, I now, with great caution and deliberation, put my hands behind my back, and unfastened the large iron buckle which belonged to the waistband of my inexpressibles.|13|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This buckle had three teeth, which, being somewhat rusty, turned with great difficulty on their axis.|14|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I brought them, however, after some trouble, at right angles to the body of the buckle, and was glad to find them remain firm in that position.|15|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Holding the instrument thus obtained within my teeth, I now proceeded to untie the knot of my cravat.|16|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I had to rest several times before I could accomplish this manoeuvre, but it was at length accomplished.|17|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
To one end of the cravat I then made fast the buckle, and the other end I tied, for greater security, tightly around my wrist.|18|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Drawing now my body upwards, with a prodigious exertion of muscular force, I succeeded, at the very first trial, in throwing the buckle over the car, and entangling it, as I had anticipated, in the circular rim of the wicker-work.|19|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
My body was now inclined towards the side of the car, at an angle of about forty-five degrees; but it must not be understood that I was therefore only forty-five degrees below the perpendicular.|0|19|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
So far from it, I still lay nearly level with the plane of the horizon; for the change of situation which I had acquired, had forced the bottom of the car considerably outwards from my position, which was accordingly one of the most imminent and deadly peril.|1|19|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It should be remembered, however, that when I fell in the first instance, from the car, if I had fAllan with my face turned toward the balloon, instead of turned outwardly from it, as it actually was; or if, in the second place, the cord by which I was suspended had chanced to hang over the upper edge, instead of through a crevice near the bottom of the car,–I say it may be readily conceived that, in either of these supposed cases, I should have been unable to accomplish even as much as I had now accomplished, and the wonderful adventures of Hans Phaall would have been utterly lost to posterity, I had therefore every reason to be grateful; although, in point of fact, I was still too stupid to be anything at all, and hung for, perhaps, a quarter of an hour in that extraordinary manner, without making the slightest farther exertion whatsoever, and in a singularly tranquil state of idiotic enjoyment.|2|19|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But this feeling did not fail to die rapidly away, and thereunto succeeded horror, and dismay, and a chilling sense of utter helplessness and ruin.|3|19|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In fact, the blood so long accumulating in the vessels of my head and throat, and which had hitherto buoyed up my spirits with madness and delirium, had now begun to retire within their proper channels, and the distinctness which was thus added to my perception of the danger, merely served to deprive me of the self-possession and courage to encounter it.|4|19|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But this weakness was, luckily for me, of no very long duration.|5|19|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In good time came to my rescue the spirit of despair, and, with frantic cries and struggles, I jerked my way bodily upwards, till at length, clutching with a vise-like grip the long-desired rim, I writhed my person over it, and fell headlong and shuddering within the car.|6|19|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It was not until some time afterward that I recovered myself sufficiently to attend to the ordinary cares of the balloon.|0|20|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I then, however, examined it with attention, and found it, to my great relief, uninjured.|1|20|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
My implements were all safe, and, fortunately, I had lost neither ballast nor provisions.|2|20|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Indeed, I had so well secured them in their places, that such an accident was entirely out of the question.|3|20|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Looking at my watch, I found it six o'clock.|4|20|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I was still rapidly ascending, and my barometer gave a present altitude of three and three-quarter miles.|5|20|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Immediately beneath me in the ocean, lay a small black object, slightly oblong in shape, seemingly about the size, and in every way bearing a great resemblance to one of those childish toys called a domino.|6|20|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Bringing my telescope to bear upon it, I plainly discerned it to be a British ninety four-gun ship, close-hauled, and pitching heavily in the sea with her head to the W.S.W. Besides this ship, I saw nothing but the ocean and the sky, and the sun, which had long arisen.|7|20|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It is now high time that I should explain to your Excellencies the object of my perilous voyage.|0|21|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Your Excellencies will bear in mind that distressed circumstances in Rotterdam had at length driven me to the resolution of committing suicide.|1|21|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It was not, however, that to life itself I had any, positive disgust, but that I was harassed beyond endurance by the adventitious miseries attending my situation.|2|21|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In this state of mind, wishing to live, yet wearied with life, the treatise at the stall of the bookseller opened a resource to my imagination.|3|21|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I then finally made up my mind.|4|21|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I determined to depart, yet live–to leave the world, yet continue to exist–in short, to drop enigmas, I resolved, let what would ensue, to force a passage, if I could, to the moon.|5|21|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Now, lest I should be supposed more of a madman than I actually am, I will detail, as well as I am able, the considerations which led me to believe that an achievement of this nature, although without doubt difficult, and incontestably full of danger, was not absolutely, to a bold spirit, beyond the confines of the possible.|6|21|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The moon's actual distance from the earth was the first thing to be attended to.|0|22|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Now, the mean or average interval between the centres of the two planets is 59.|1|22|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
9643 of the earth's equatorial radii, or only about 237,000 miles.|2|22|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I say the mean or average interval.|3|22|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But it must be borne in mind that the form of the moon's orbit being an ellipse of eccentricity amounting to no less than 0.|4|22|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
05484 of the major semi-axis of the ellipse itself, and the earth's centre being situated in its focus, if I could, in any manner, contrive to meet the moon, as it were, in its perigee, the above mentioned distance would be materially diminished.|5|22|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But, to say nothing at present of this possibility, it was very certain that, at all events, from the 237,000 miles I would have to deduct the radius of the earth, say 4,000, and the radius of the moon, say 1080, in all 5,080, leaving an actual interval to be traversed, under average circumstances, of 231,920 miles.|6|22|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Now this, I reflected, was no very extraordinary distance.|7|22|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Travelling on land has been repeatedly accomplished at the rate of thirty miles per hour, and indeed a much greater speed may be anticipated.|8|22|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But even at this velocity, it would take me no more than 322 days to reach the surface of the moon.|9|22|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
There were, however, many particulars inducing me to believe that my average rate of travelling might possibly very much exceed that of thirty miles per hour, and, as these considerations did not fail to make a deep impression upon my mind, I will mention them more fully hereafter.|10|22|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The next point to be regarded was a matter of far greater importance.|0|23|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
From indications afforded by the barometer, we find that, in ascensions from the surface of the earth we have, at the height of 1,000 feet, left below us about one-thirtieth of the entire mass of atmospheric air, that at 10,600 we have ascended through nearly one-third; and that at 18,000, which is not far from the elevation of Cotopaxi, we have surmounted one-half the material, or, at all events, one-half the ponderable, body of air incumbent upon our globe.|1|23|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It is also calculated that at an altitude not exceeding the hundredth part of the earth's diameter–that is, not exceeding eighty miles–the rarefaction would be so excessive that animal life could in no manner be sustained, and, moreover, that the most delicate means we possess of ascertaining the presence of the atmosphere would be inadequate to assure us of its existence.|2|23|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But I did not fail to perceive that these latter calculations are founded altogether on our experimental knowledge of the properties of air, and the mechanical laws regulating its dilation and compression, in what may be called, comparatively speaking, the immediate vicinity of the earth itself; and, at the same time, it is taken for granted that animal life is and must be essentially incapable of modification at any given unattainable distance from the surface.|3|23|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Now, all such reasoning and from such data must, of course, be simply analogical.|4|23|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The greatest height ever reached by man was that of 25,000 feet, attained in the aeronautic expedition of Messieurs Gay-Lussac and Biot.|5|23|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This is a moderate altitude, even when compared with the eighty miles in question; and I could not help thinking that the subject admitted room for doubt and great latitude for speculation.|6|23|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But, in point of fact, an ascension being made to any given altitude, the ponderable quantity of air surmounted in any farther ascension is by no means in proportion to the additional height ascended (as may be plainly seen from what has been stated before), but in a ratio constantly decreasing.|0|24|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It is therefore evident that, ascend as high as we may, we cannot, literally speaking, arrive at a limit beyond which no atmosphere is to be found.|1|24|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It must exist, I argued; although it may exist in a state of infinite rarefaction.|2|24|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
On the other hand, I was aware that arguments have not been wanting to prove the existence of a real and definite limit to the atmosphere, beyond which there is absolutely no air whatsoever.|0|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But a circumstance which has been left out of view by those who contend for such a limit seemed to me, although no positive refutation of their creed, still a point worthy very serious investigation.|1|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
On comparing the intervals between the successive arrivals of Encke's comet at its perihelion, after giving credit, in the most exact manner, for all the disturbances due to the attractions of the planets, it appears that the periods are gradually diminishing; that is to say, the major axis of the comet's ellipse is growing shorter, in a slow but perfectly regular decrease.|2|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Now, this is precisely what ought to be the case, if we suppose a resistance experienced from the comet from an extremely rare ethereal medium pervading the regions of its orbit.|3|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
For it is evident that such a medium must, in retarding the comet's velocity, increase its centripetal, by weakening its centrifugal force.|4|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In other words, the sun's attraction would be constantly attaining greater power, and the comet would be drawn nearer at every revolution.|5|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Indeed, there is no other way of accounting for the variation in question.|6|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But again.|7|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The real diameter of the same comet's nebulosity is observed to contract rapidly as it approaches the sun, and dilate with equal rapidity in its departure towards its aphelion.|8|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Was I not justifiable in supposing with M. Valz, that this apparent condensation of volume has its origin in the compression of the same ethereal medium I have spoken of before, and which is only denser in proportion to its solar vicinity?|9|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The lenticular-shaped phenomenon, also called the zodiacal light, was a matter worthy of attention.|10|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This radiance, so apparent in the tropics, and which cannot be mistaken for any meteoric lustre, extends from the horizon obliquely upward, and follows generally the direction of the sun's equator.|11|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It appeared to me evidently in the nature of a rare atmosphere extending from the sun outward, beyond the orbit of Venus at least, and I believed indefinitely farther.|12|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
* Indeed, this medium I could not suppose confined to the path of the comet's ellipse, or to the immediate neighborhood of the sun.|13|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It was easy, on the contrary, to imagine it pervading the entire regions of our planetary system, condensed into what we call atmosphere at the planets themselves, and perhaps at some of them modified by considerations, so to speak, purely geological.|14|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
*The zodiacal light is probably what the ancients called Trabes.|0|26|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Emicant Trabes quos docos vocant.|1|26|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
–Pliny, lib.|2|26|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
2, p.|3|26|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
26.|4|26|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Having adopted this view of the subject, I had little further hesitation.|0|27|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Granting that on my passage I should meet with atmosphere essentially the same as at the surface of the earth, I conceived that, by means of the very ingenious apparatus of M. Grimm, I should readily be enabled to condense it in sufficient quantity for the purposes of respiration.|1|27|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This would remove the chief obstacle in a journey to the moon.|2|27|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I had indeed spent some money and great labor in adapting the apparatus to the object intended, and confidently looked forward to its successful application, if I could manage to complete the voyage within any reasonable period.|3|27|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This brings me back to the rate at which it might be possible to travel.|4|27|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It is true that balloons, in the first stage of their ascensions from the earth, are known to rise with a velocity comparatively moderate.|0|28|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Now, the power of elevation lies altogether in the superior lightness of the gas in the balloon compared with the atmospheric air; and, at first sight, it does not appear probable that, as the balloon acquires altitude, and consequently arrives successively in atmospheric strata of densities rapidly diminishing–I say, it does not appear at all reasonable that, in this its progress upwards, the original velocity should be accelerated.|1|28|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
On the other hand, I was not aware that, in any recorded ascension, a diminution was apparent in the absolute rate of ascent; although such should have been the case, if on account of nothing else, on account of the escape of gas through balloons ill-constructed, and varnished with no better material than the ordinary varnish.|2|28|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It seemed, therefore, that the effect of such escape was only sufficient to counterbalance the effect of some accelerating power.|3|28|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I now considered that, provided in my passage I found the medium I had imagined, and provided that it should prove to be actually and essentially what we denominate atmospheric air, it could make comparatively little difference at what extreme state of rarefaction I should discover it–that is to say, in regard to my power of ascending–for the gas in the balloon would not only be itself subject to rarefaction partially similar (in proportion to the occurrence of which, I could suffer an escape of so much as would be requisite to prevent explosion), but, being what it was, would, at all events, continue specifically lighter than any compound whatever of mere nitrogen and oxygen.|4|28|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In the meantime, the force of gravitation would be constantly diminishing, in proportion to the squares of the distances, and thus, with a velocity prodigiously accelerating, I should at length arrive in those distant regions where the force of the earth's attraction would be superseded by that of the moon.|5|28|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In accordance with these ideas, I did not think it worth while to encumber myself with more provisions than would be sufficient for a period of forty days.|6|28|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
There was still, however, another difficulty, which occasioned me some little disquietude.|0|29|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It has been observed, that, in balloon ascensions to any considerable height, besides the pain attending respiration, great uneasiness is experienced about the head and body, often accompanied with bleeding at the nose, and other symptoms of an alarming kind, and growing more and more inconvenient in proportion to the altitude attained.|1|29|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
* This was a reflection of a nature somewhat startling.|2|29|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Was it not probable that these symptoms would increase indefinitely, or at least until terminated by death itself?|3|29|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I finally thought not.|4|29|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Their origin was to be looked for in the progressive removal of the customary atmospheric pressure upon the surface of the body, and consequent distention of the superficial blood-vessels–not in any positive disorganization of the animal system, as in the case of difficulty in breathing, where the atmospheric density is chemically insufficient for the due renovation of blood in a ventricle of the heart.|5|29|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Unless for default of this renovation, I could see no reason, therefore, why life could not be sustained even in a vacuum; for the expansion and compression of chest, commonly called breathing, is action purely muscular, and the cause, not the effect, of respiration.|6|29|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In a word, I conceived that, as the body should become habituated to the want of atmospheric pressure, the sensations of pain would gradually diminish–and to endure them while they continued, I relied with confidence upon the iron hardihood of my constitution.|7|29|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
*Since the original publication of Hans Phaall, I find that Mr. Green, of Nassau balloon notoriety, and other late aeronauts, deny the assertions of Humboldt, in this respect, and speak of a decreasing inconvenience,–precisely in accordance with the theory here urged in a mere spirit of banter.|0|30|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Thus, may it please your Excellencies, I have detailed some, though by no means all, the considerations which led me to form the project of a lunar voyage.|0|31|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I shall now proceed to lay before you the result of an attempt so apparently audacious in conception, and, at all events, so utterly unparalleled in the annals of mankind.|1|31|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Having attained the altitude before mentioned, that is to say three miles and three-quarters, I threw out from the car a quantity of feathers, and found that I still ascended with sufficient rapidity; there was, therefore, no necessity for discharging any ballast.|0|32|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I was glad of this, for I wished to retain with me as much weight as I could carry, for reasons which will be explained in the sequel.|1|32|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I as yet suffered no bodily inconvenience, breathing with great freedom, and feeling no pain whatever in the head.|2|32|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The cat was lying very demurely upon my coat, which I had taken off, and eyeing the pigeons with an air of nonchalance.|3|32|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
These latter being tied by the leg, to prevent their escape, were busily employed in picking up some grains of rice scattered for them in the bottom of the car.|4|32|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
At twenty minutes past six o'clock, the barometer showed an elevation of 26,400 feet, or five miles to a fraction.|0|33|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The prospect seemed unbounded.|1|33|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Indeed, it is very easily calculated by means of spherical geometry, what a great extent of the earth's area I beheld.|2|33|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The convex surface of any segment of a sphere is, to the entire surface of the sphere itself, as the versed sine of the segment to the diameter of the sphere.|3|33|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Now, in my case, the versed sine–that is to say, the thickness of the segment beneath me–was about equal to my elevation, or the elevation of the point of sight above the surface.|4|33|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
"""As five miles, then, to eight thousand,"" would express the proportion of the earth's area seen by me."|5|33|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In other words, I beheld as much as a sixteen-hundredth part of the whole surface of the globe.|6|33|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The sea appeared unruffled as a mirror, although, by means of the spy-glass, I could perceive it to be in a state of violent agitation.|7|33|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The ship was no longer visible, having drifted away, apparently to the eastward.|8|33|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I now began to experience, at intervals, severe pain in the head, especially about the ears–still, however, breathing with tolerable freedom.|9|33|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The cat and pigeons seemed to suffer no inconvenience whatsoever.|10|33|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
At twenty minutes before seven, the balloon entered a long series of dense cloud, which put me to great trouble, by damaging my condensing apparatus and wetting me to the skin.|0|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This was, to be sure, a singular recontre, for I had not believed it possible that a cloud of this nature could be sustained at so great an elevation.|1|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I thought it best, however, to throw out two five-pound pieces of ballast, reserving still a weight of one hundred and sixty-five pounds.|2|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Upon so doing, I soon rose above the difficulty, and perceived immediately, that I had obtained a great increase in my rate of ascent.|3|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In a few seconds after my leaving the cloud, a flash of vivid lightning shot from one end of it to the other, and caused it to kindle up, throughout its vast extent, like a mass of ignited and glowing charcoal.|4|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This, it must be remembered, was in the broad light of day.|5|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
No fancy may picture the sublimity which might have been exhibited by a similar phenomenon taking place amid the darkness of the night.|6|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Hell itself might have been found a fitting image.|7|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Even as it was, my hair stood on end, while I gazed afar down within the yawning abysses, letting imagination descend, as it were, and stalk about in the strange vaulted halls, and ruddy gulfs, and red ghastly chasms of the hideous and unfathomable fire.|8|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I had indeed made a narrow escape.|9|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Had the balloon remained a very short while longer within the cloud–that is to say–had not the inconvenience of getting wet, determined me to discharge the ballast, inevitable ruin would have been the consequence.|10|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Such perils, although little considered, are perhaps the greatest which must be encountered in balloons.|11|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I had by this time, however, attained too great an elevation to be any longer uneasy on this head.|12|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I was now rising rapidly, and by seven o'clock the barometer indicated an altitude of no less than nine miles and a half.|0|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I began to find great difficulty in drawing my breath.|1|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
My head, too, was excessively painful; and, having felt for some time a moisture about my cheeks, I at length discovered it to be blood, which was oozing quite fast from the drums of my ears.|2|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
My eyes, also, gave me great uneasiness.|3|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Upon passing the hand over them they seemed to have protruded from their sockets in no inconsiderable degree; and all objects in the car, and even the balloon itself, appeared distorted to my vision.|4|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
These symptoms were more than I had expected, and occasioned me some alarm.|5|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
At this juncture, very imprudently, and without consideration, I threw out from the car three five-pound pieces of ballast.|6|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The accelerated rate of ascent thus obtained, carried me too rapidly, and without sufficient gradation, into a highly rarefied stratum of the atmosphere, and the result had nearly proved fatal to my expedition and to myself.|7|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I was suddenly seized with a spasm which lasted for more than five minutes, and even when this, in a measure, ceased, I could catch my breath only at long intervals, and in a gasping manner–bleeding all the while copiously at the nose and ears, and even slightly at the eyes.|8|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The pigeons appeared distressed in the extreme, and struggled to escape; while the cat mewed piteously, and, with her tongue hanging out of her mouth, staggered to and fro in the car as if under the influence of poison.|9|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I now too late discovered the great rashness of which I had been guilty in discharging the ballast, and my agitation was excessive.|10|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I anticipated nothing less than death, and death in a few minutes.|11|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The physical suffering I underwent contributed also to render me nearly incapable of making any exertion for the preservation of my life.|12|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I had, indeed, little power of reflection left, and the violence of the pain in my head seemed to be greatly on the increase.|13|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Thus I found that my senses would shortly give way altogether, and I had already clutched one of the valve ropes with the view of attempting a descent, when the recollection of the trick I had played the three creditors, and the possible consequences to myself, should I return, operated to deter me for the moment.|14|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I lay down in the bottom of the car, and endeavored to collect my faculties.|15|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In this I so far succeeded as to determine upon the experiment of losing blood.|16|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Having no lancet, however, I was constrained to perform the operation in the best manner I was able, and finally succeeded in opening a vein in my right arm, with the blade of my penknife.|17|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The blood had hardly commenced flowing when I experienced a sensible relief, and by the time I had lost about half a moderate basin full, most of the worst symptoms had abandoned me entirely.|18|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I nevertheless did not think it expedient to attempt getting on my feet immediately; but, having tied up my arm as well as I could, I lay still for about a quarter of an hour.|19|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
At the end of this time I arose, and found myself freer from absolute pain of any kind than I had been during the last hour and a quarter of my ascension.|20|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The difficulty of breathing, however, was diminished in a very slight degree, and I found that it would soon be positively necessary to make use of my condenser.|21|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In the meantime, looking toward the cat, who was again snugly stowed away upon my coat, I discovered to my infinite surprise, that she had taken the opportunity of my indisposition to bring into light a litter of three little kittens.|22|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This was an addition to the number of passengers on my part altogether unexpected; but I was pleased at the occurrence.|23|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It would afford me a chance of bringing to a kind of test the truth of a surmise, which, more than anything else, had influenced me in attempting this ascension.|24|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I had imagined that the habitual endurance of the atmospheric pressure at the surface of the earth was the cause, or nearly so, of the pain attending animal existence at a distance above the surface.|25|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Should the kittens be found to suffer uneasiness in an equal degree with their mother, I must consider my theory in fault, but a failure to do so I should look upon as a strong confirmation of my idea.|26|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
By eight o'clock I had actually attained an elevation of seventeen miles above the surface of the earth.|0|36|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Thus it seemed to me evident that my rate of ascent was not only on the increase, but that the progression would have been apparent in a slight degree even had I not discharged the ballast which I did.|1|36|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The pains in my head and ears returned, at intervals, with violence, and I still continued to bleed occasionally at the nose; but, upon the whole, I suffered much less than might have been expected.|2|36|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I breathed, however, at every moment, with more and more difficulty, and each inhalation was attended with a troublesome spasmodic action of the chest.|3|36|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I now unpacked the condensing apparatus, and got it ready for immediate use.|4|36|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The view of the earth, at this period of my ascension, was beautiful indeed.|0|37|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
To the westward, the northward, and the southward, as far as I could see, lay a boundless sheet of apparently unruffled ocean, which every moment gained a deeper and a deeper tint of blue and began already to assume a slight appearance of convexity.|1|37|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
At a vast distance to the eastward, although perfectly discernible, extended the islands of Great Britain, the entire Atlantic coasts of France and Spain, with a small portion of the northern part of the continent of Africa.|2|37|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Of individual edifices not a trace could be discovered, and the proudest cities of mankind had utterly faded away from the face of the earth.|3|37|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
From the rock of Gibraltar, now dwindled into a dim speck, the dark Mediterranean sea, dotted with shining islands as the heaven is dotted with stars, spread itself out to the eastward as far as my vision extended, until its entire mass of waters seemed at length to tumble headlong over the abyss of the horizon, and I found myself listening on tiptoe for the echoes of the mighty cataract.|4|37|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Overhead, the sky was of a jetty black, and the stars were brilliantly visible.|5|37|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The pigeons about this time seeming to undergo much suffering, I determined upon giving them their liberty.|0|38|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I first untied one of them, a beautiful gray-mottled pigeon, and placed him upon the rim of the wicker-work.|1|38|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
He appeared extremely uneasy, looking anxiously around him, fluttering his wings, and making a loud cooing noise, but could not be persuaded to trust himself from off the car.|2|38|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I took him up at last, and threw him to about half a dozen yards from the balloon.|3|38|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
He made, however, no attempt to descend as I had expected, but struggled with great vehemence to get back, uttering at the same time very shrill and piercing cries.|4|38|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
He at length succeeded in regaining his former station on the rim, but had hardly done so when his head dropped upon his breast, and be fell dead within the car.|5|38|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The other one did not prove so unfortunate.|6|38|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
To prevent his following the example of his companion, and accomplishing a return, I threw him downward with all my force, and was pleased to find him continue his descent, with great velocity, making use of his wings with ease, and in a perfectly natural manner.|7|38|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In a very short time he was out of sight, and I have no doubt he reached home in safety.|8|38|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Puss, who seemed in a great measure recovered from her illness, now made a hearty meal of the dead bird and then went to sleep with much apparent satisfaction.|9|38|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Her kittens were quite lively, and so far evinced not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever.|10|38|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
At a quarter-past eight, being no longer able to draw breath without the most intolerable pain, I proceeded forthwith to adjust around the car the apparatus belonging to the condenser.|0|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This apparatus will require some little explanation, and your Excellencies will please to bear in mind that my object, in the first place, was to surround myself and cat entirely with a barricade against the highly rarefied atmosphere in which I was existing, with the intention of introducing within this barricade, by means of my condenser, a quantity of this same atmosphere sufficiently condensed for the purposes of respiration.|1|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
With this object in view I had prepared a very strong perfectly air-tight, but flexible gum-elastic bag.|2|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In this bag, which was of sufficient dimensions, the entire car was in a manner placed.|3|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
That is to say, it (the bag) was drawn over the whole bottom of the car, up its sides, and so on, along the outside of the ropes, to the upper rim or hoop where the net-work is attached.|4|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Having pulled the bag up in this way, and formed a complete enclosure on all sides, and at botttom, it was now necessary to fasten up its top or mouth, by passing its material over the hoop of the net-work–in other words, between the net-work and the hoop.|5|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But if the net-work were separated from the hoop to admit this passage, what was to sustain the car in the meantime?|6|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Now the net-work was not permanently fastened to the hoop, but attached by a series of running loops or nooses.|7|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I therefore undid only a few of these loops at one time, leaving the car suspended by the remainder.|8|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Having thus inserted a portion of the cloth forming the upper part of the bag, I refastened the loops–not to the hoop, for that would have been impossible, since the cloth now intervened–but to a series of large buttons, affixed to the cloth itself, about three feet below the mouth of the bag, the intervals between the buttons having been made to correspond to the intervals between the loops.|9|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This done, a few more of the loops were unfastened from the rim, a farther portion of the cloth introduced, and the disengaged loops then connected with their proper buttons.|10|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In this way it was possible to insert the whole upper part of the bag between the net-work and the hoop.|11|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It is evident that the hoop would now drop down within the car, while the whole weight of the car itself, with all its contents, would be held up merely by the strength of the buttons.|12|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This, at first sight, would seem an inadequate dependence; but it was by no means so, for the buttons were not only very strong in themselves, but so close together that a very slight portion of the whole weight was supported by any one of them.|13|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Indeed, had the car and contents been three times heavier than they were, I should not have been at all uneasy.|14|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I now raised up the hoop again within the covering of gum-elastic, and propped it at nearly its former height by means of three light poles prepared for the occasion.|15|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This was done, of course, to keep the bag distended at the top, and to preserve the lower part of the net-work in its proper situation.|16|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
All that now remained was to fasten up the mouth of the enclosure; and this was readily accomplished by gathering the folds of the material together, and twisting them up very tightly on the inside by means of a kind of stationary tourniquet.|17|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In the sides of the covering thus adjusted round the car, had been inserted three circular panes of thick but clear glass, through which I could see without difficulty around me in every horizontal direction.|0|40|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In that portion of the cloth forming the bottom, was likewise, a fourth window, of the same kind, and corresponding with a small aperture in the floor of the car itself.|1|40|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This enabled me to see perpendicularly down, but having found it impossible to place any similar contrivance overhead, on account of the peculiar manner of closing up the opening there, and the consequent wrinkles in the cloth, I could expect to see no objects situated directly in my zenith.|2|40|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This, of course, was a matter of little consequence; for had I even been able to place a window at top, the balloon itself would have prevented my making any use of it.|3|40|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
About a foot below one of the side windows was a circular opening, eight inches in diameter, and fitted with a brass rim adapted in its inner edge to the windings of a screw.|0|41|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In this rim was screwed the large tube of the condenser, the body of the machine being, of course, within the chamber of gum-elastic.|1|41|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Through this tube a quantity of the rare atmosphere circumjacent being drawn by means of a vacuum created in the body of the machine, was thence discharged, in a state of condensation, to mingle with the thin air already in the chamber.|2|41|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This operation being repeated several times, at length filled the chamber with atmosphere proper for all the purposes of respiration.|3|41|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But in so confined a space it would, in a short time, necessarily become foul, and unfit for use from frequent contact with the lungs.|4|41|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It was then ejected by a small valve at the bottom of the car–the dense air readily sinking into the thinner atmosphere below.|5|41|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
To avoid the inconvenience of making a total vacuum at any moment within the chamber, this purification was never accomplished all at once, but in a gradual manner–the valve being opened only for a few seconds, then closed again, until one or two strokes from the pump of the condenser had supplied the place of the atmosphere ejected.|6|41|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
For the sake of experiment I had put the cat and kittens in a small basket, and suspended it outside the car to a button at the bottom, close by the valve, through which I could feed them at any moment when necessary.|7|41|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I did this at some little risk, and before closing the mouth of the chamber, by reaching under the car with one of the poles before mentioned to which a hook had been attached.|8|41|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
By the time I had fully completed these arrangements and filled the chamber as explained, it wanted only ten minutes of nine o'clock.|0|42|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
During the whole period of my being thus employed, I endured the most terrible distress from difficulty of respiration, and bitterly did I repent the negligence or rather fool-hardiness, of which I had been guilty, of putting off to the last moment a matter of so much importance.|1|42|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But having at length accomplished it, I soon began to reap the benefit of my invention.|2|42|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Once again I breathed with perfect freedom and ease–and indeed why should I not?|3|42|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I was also agreeably surprised to find myself, in a great measure, relieved from the violent pains which had hitherto tormented me.|4|42|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
A slight headache, accompanied with a sensation of fulness or distention about the wrists, the ankles, and the throat, was nearly all of which I had now to complain.|5|42|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Thus it seemed evident that a greater part of the uneasiness attending the removal of atmospheric pressure had actually worn off, as I had expected, and that much of the pain endured for the last two hours should have been attributed altogether to the effects of a deficient respiration.|6|42|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
At twenty minutes before nine o'clock–that is to say, a short time prior to my closing up the mouth of the chamber, the mercury attained its limit, or ran down, in the barometer, which, as I mentioned before, was one of an extended construction.|0|43|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It then indicated an altitude on my part of 132,000 feet, or five-and-twenty miles, and I consequently surveyed at that time an extent of the earth's area amounting to no less than the three hundred-and-twentieth part of its entire superficies.|1|43|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
At nine o'clock I had again lost sight of land to the eastward, but not before I became aware that the balloon was drifting rapidly to the N. N. W. The convexity of the ocean beneath me was very evident indeed, although my view was often interrupted by the masses of cloud which floated to and fro.|2|43|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I observed now that even the lightest vapors never rose to more than ten miles above the level of the sea.|3|43|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
At half past nine I tried the experiment of throwing out a handful of feathers through the valve.|0|44|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
They did not float as I had expected; but dropped down perpendicularly, like a bullet, en masse, and with the greatest velocity–being out of sight in a very few seconds.|1|44|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I did not at first know what to make of this extraordinary phenomenon; not being able to believe that my rate of ascent had, of a sudden, met with so prodigious an acceleration.|2|44|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But it soon occurred to me that the atmosphere was now far too rare to sustain even the feathers; that they actually fell, as they appeared to do, with great rapidity; and that I had been surprised by the united velocities of their descent and my own elevation.|3|44|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
By ten o'clock I found that I had very little to occupy my immediate attention.|0|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Affairs went swimmingly, and I believed the balloon to be going upward witb a speed increasing momently although I had no longer any means of ascertaining the progression of the increase.|1|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I suffered no pain or uneasiness of any kind, and enjoyed better spirits than I had at any period since my departure from Rotterdam, busying myself now in examining the state of my various apparatus, and now in regenerating the atmosphere within the chamber.|2|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This latter point I determined to attend to at regular intervals of forty minutes, more on account of the preservation of my health, than from so frequent a renovation being absolutely necessary.|3|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In the meanwhile I could not help making anticipations.|4|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Fancy revelled in the wild and dreamy regions of the moon.|5|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Imagination, feeling herself for once unshackled, roamed at will among the ever-changing wonders of a shadowy and unstable land.|6|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Now there were boary and time-honored forests, and craggy precipices, and waterfalls tumbling with a loud noise into abysses without a bottom.|7|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Then I came suddenly into still noonday solitudes, where no wind of heaven ever intruded, and where vast meadows of poppies, and slender, lily-looking flowers spread themselves out a weary distance, all silent and motionless forever.|8|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Then again I journeyed far down away into another country where it was all one dim and vague lake, with a boundary line of clouds.|9|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
And out of this melancholy water arose a forest of tall eastern trees, like a wilderness of dreams.|10|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
And I have in mind that the shadows of the trees which fell upon the lake remained not on the surface where they fell, but sunk slowly and steadily down, and commingled with the waves, while from the trunks of the trees other shadows were continually coming out, and taking the place of their brothers thus entombed.|11|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
"""This then,"" I said thoughtfully, ""is the very reason why the waters of this lake grow blacker with age, and more melancholy as the hours run on""."|12|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But fancies such as these were not the sole possessors of my brain.|13|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Horrors of a nature most stern and most appalling would too frequently obtrude themselves upon my mind, and shake the innermost depths of my soul with the bare supposition of their possibility.|14|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Yet I would not suffer my thoughts for any length of time to dwell upon these latter speculations, rightly judging the real and palpable dangers of the voyage sufficient for my undivided attention.|15|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
At five o'clock, p.|0|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
m.|1|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
, being engaged in regenerating the atmosphere within the chamber, I took that opportunity of observing the cat and kittens through the valve.|2|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The cat herself appeared to suffer again very much, and I had no hesitation in attributing her uneasiness chiefly to a difficulty in breathing; but my experiment with the kittens had resulted very strangely.|3|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I had expected, of course, to see them betray a sense of pain, although in a less degree than their mother, and this would have been sufficient to confirm my opinion concerning the habitual endurance of atmospheric pressure.|4|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But I was not prepared to find them, upon close examination, evidently enjoying a high degree of health, breathing with the greatest ease and perfect regularity, and evincing not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever.|5|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I could only account for all this by extending my theory, and supposing that the highly rarefied atmosphere around might perhaps not be, as I had taken for granted, chemically insufficient for the purposes of life, and that a person born in such a medium might, possibly, be unaware of any inconvenience attending its inhalation, while, upon removal to the denser strata near the earth, he might endure tortures of a similar nature to those I had so lately experienced.|6|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It has since been to me a matter of deep regret that an awkward accident, at this time, occasioned me the loss of my little family of cats, and deprived me of the insight into this matter which a continued experiment might have afforded.|7|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In passing my hand through the valve, with a cup of water for the old puss, the sleeves of my shirt became entangled in the loop which sustained the basket, and thus, in a moment, loosened it from the bottom.|8|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Had the whole actually vanished into air, it could not have shot from my sight in a more abrupt and instantaneous manner.|9|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Positively, there could not have intervened the tenth part of a second between the disengagement of the basket and its absolute and total disappearance with all that it contained.|10|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
My good wishes followed it to the earth, but of course, I had no hope that either cat or kittens would ever live to tell the tale of their misfortune.|11|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
At six o'clock, I perceived a great portion of the earth's visible area to the eastward involved in thick shadow, which continued to advance with great rapidity, until, at five minutes before seven, the whole surface in view was enveloped in the darkness of night.|0|47|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It was not, however, until long after this time that the rays of the setting sun ceased to illumine the balloon; and this circumstance, although of course fully anticipated, did not fail to give me an infinite deal of pleasure.|1|47|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It was evident that, in the morning, I should behold the rising luminary many hours at least before the citizens of Rotterdam, in spite of their situation so much farther to the eastward, and thus, day after day, in proportion to the height ascended, would I enjoy the light of the sun for a longer and a longer period.|2|47|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I now determined to keep a journal of my passage, reckoning the days from one to twenty-four hours continuously, without taking into consideration the intervals of darkness.|3|47|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
At ten o'clock, feeling sleepy, I determined to lie down for the rest of the night; but here a difficulty presented itself, which, obvious as it may appear, had escaped my attention up to the very moment of which I am now speaking.|0|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
If I went to sleep as I proposed, how could the atmosphere in the chamber be regenerated in the interim?|1|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
To breathe it for more than an hour, at the farthest, would be a matter of impossibility, or, if even this term could be extended to an hour and a quarter, the most ruinous consequences might ensue.|2|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The consideration of this dilemma gave me no little disquietude; and it will hardly be believed, that, after the dangers I had undergone, I should look upon this business in so serious a light, as to give up all hope of accomplishing my ultimate design, and finally make up my mind to the necessity of a descent.|3|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But this hesitation was only momentary.|4|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I reflected that man is the veriest slave of custom, and that many points in the routine of his existence are deemed essentially important, which are only so at all by his having rendered them habitual.|5|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It was very certain that I could not do without sleep; but I might easily bring myself to feel no inconvenience from being awakened at intervals of an hour during the whole period of my repose.|6|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It would require but five minutes at most to regenerate the atmosphere in the fullest manner, and the only real difficulty was to contrive a method of arousing myself at the proper moment for so doing.|7|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
But this was a question which, I am willing to confess, occasioned me no little trouble in its solution.|8|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
To be sure, I had heard of the student who, to prevent his falling asleep over his books, held in one hand a ball of copper, the din of whose descent into a basin of the same metal on the floor beside his chair, served effectually to startle him up, if, at any moment, he should be overcome with drowsiness.|9|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
My own case, however, was very different indeed, and left me no room for any similar idea; for I did not wish to keep awake, but to be aroused from slumber at regular intervals of time.|10|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I at length hit upon the following expedient, which, simple as it may seem, was hailed by me, at the moment of discovery, as an invention fully equal to that of the telescope, the steam-engine, or the art of printing itself.|11|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It is necessary to premise, that the balloon, at the elevation now attained, continued its course upward with an even and undeviating ascent, and the car consequently followed with a steadiness so perfect that it would have been impossible to detect in it the slightest vacillation whatever.|0|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This circumstance favored me greatly in the project I now determined to adopt.|1|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
My supply of water had been put on board in kegs containing five gallons each, and ranged very securely around the interior of the car.|2|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I unfastened one of these, and taking two ropes tied them tightly across the rim of the wicker-work from one side to the other; placing them about a foot apart and parallel so as to form a kind of shelf, upon which I placed the keg, and steadied it in a horizontal position.|3|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
About eight inches immediately below these ropes, and four feet from the bottom of the car I fastened another shelf–but made of thin plank, being the only similar piece of wood I had.|4|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Upon this latter shelf, and exactly beneath one of the rims of the keg, a small earthern pitcher was deposited.|5|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I now bored a hole in the end of the keg over the pitcher, and fitted in a plug of soft wood, cut in a tapering or conical shape.|6|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This plug I pushed in or pulled out, as might happen, until, after a few experiments, it arrived at that exact degree of tightness, at which the water, oozing from the hole, and falling into the pitcher below, would fill the latter to the brim in the period of sixty minutes.|7|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This, of course, was a matter briefly and easily ascertained, by noticing the proportion of the pitcher filled in any given time.|8|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Having arranged all this, the rest of the plan is obvious.|9|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
My bed was so contrived upon the floor of the car, as to bring my head, in lying down, immediately below the mouth of the pitcher.|10|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It was evident, that, at the expiration of an hour, the pitcher, getting full, would be forced to run over, and to run over at the mouth, which was somewhat lower than the rim.|11|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It was also evident, that the water thus falling from a height of more than four feet, could not do otherwise than fall upon my face, and that the sure consequences would be, to waken me up instantaneously, even from the soundest slumber in the world.|12|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It was fully eleven by the time I had completed these arrangements, and I immediately betook myself to bed, with full confidence in the efficiency of my invention.|0|50|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Nor in this matter was I disappointed.|1|50|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Punctually every sixty minutes was I aroused by my trusty chronometer, when, having emptied the pitcher into the bung-hole of the keg, and performed the duties of the condenser, I retired again to bed.|2|50|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
These regular interruptions to my slumber caused me even less discomfort than I had anticipated; and when I finally arose for the day, it was seven o'clock, and the sun had attained many degrees above the line of my horizon.|3|50|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
April 3d.|0|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I found the balloon at an immense height indeed, and the earth's apparent convexity increased in a material degree.|1|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Below me in the ocean lay a cluster of black specks, which undoubtedly were islands.|2|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Far away to the northward I perceived a thin, white, and exceedingly brilliant line, or streak, on the edge of the horizon, and I had no hesitation in supposing it to be the southern disk of the ices of the Polar Sea.|3|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
My curiosity was greatly excited, for I had hopes of passing on much farther to the north, and might possibly, at some period, find myself placed directly above the Pole itself.|4|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I now lamented that my great elevation would, in this case, prevent my taking as accurate a survey as I could wish.|5|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Much, however, might be ascertained.|6|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Nothing else of an extraordinary nature occurred during the day.|7|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
My apparatus all continued in good order, and the balloon still ascended without any perceptible vacillation.|8|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The cold was intense, and obliged me to wrap up closely in an overcoat.|9|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
When darkness came over the earth, I betook myself to bed, although it was for many hours afterward broad daylight all around my immediate situation.|10|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The water-clock was punctual in its duty, and I slept until next morning soundly, with the exception of the periodical interruption.|11|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
April 4th.|0|52|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Arose in good health and spirits, and was astonished at the singular change which had taken place in the appearance of the sea.|1|52|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It had lost, in a great measure, the deep tint of blue it had hitherto worn, being now of a grayish-white, and of a lustre dazzling to the eye.|2|52|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The islands were no longer visible; whether they had passed down the horizon to the southeast, or whether my increasing elevation had left them out of sight, it is impossible to say.|3|52|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I was inclined, however, to the latter opinion.|4|52|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The rim of ice to the northward was growing more and more apparent.|5|52|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Cold by no means so intense.|6|52|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Nothing of importance occurred, and I passed the day in reading, having taken care to supply myself with books.|7|52|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
April 5th.|0|53|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Beheld the singular phenomenon of the sun rising while nearly the whole visible surface of the earth continued to be involved in darkness.|1|53|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In time, however, the light spread itself over all, and I again saw the line of ice to the northward.|2|53|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It was now very distinct, and appeared of a much darker hue than the waters of the ocean.|3|53|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I was evidently approaching it, and with great rapidity.|4|53|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Fancied I could again distinguish a strip of land to the eastward, and one also to the westward, but could not be certain.|5|53|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Weather moderate.|6|53|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Nothing of any consequence happened during the day.|7|53|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Went early to bed.|8|53|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
April 6th.|0|54|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Was surprised at finding the rim of ice at a very moderate distance, and an immense field of the same material stretching away off to the horizon in the north.|1|54|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It was evident that if the balloon held its present course, it would soon arrive above the Frozen Ocean, and I had now little doubt of ultimately seeing the Pole.|2|54|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
During the whole of the day I continued to near the ice.|3|54|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Toward night the limits of my horizon very suddenly and materially increased, owing undoubtedly to the earth's form being that of an oblate spheroid, and my arriving above the flattened regions in the vicinity of the Arctic circle.|4|54|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
When darkness at length overtook me, I went to bed in great anxiety, fearing to pass over the object of so much curiosity when I should have no opportunity of observing it.|5|54|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
April 7th.|0|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Arose early, and, to my great joy, at length beheld what there could be no hesitation in supposing the northern Pole itself.|1|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It was there, beyond a doubt, and immediately beneath my feet; but, alas!|2|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I had now ascended to so vast a distance, that nothing could with accuracy be discerned.|3|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Indeed, to judge from the progression of the numbers indicating my various altitudes, respectively, at different periods, between six A.M. on the second of April, and twenty minutes before nine A.M. of the same day (at which time the barometer ran down), it might be fairly inferred that the balloon had now, at four o'clock in the morning of April the seventh, reached a height of not less, certainly, than 7,254 miles above the surface of the sea.|4|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This elevation may appear immense, but the estimate upon which it is calculated gave a result in all probability far inferior to the truth.|5|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
At all events I undoubtedly beheld the whole of the earth's major diameter; the entire northern hemisphere lay beneath me like a chart orthographically projected: and the great circle of the equator itself formed the boundary line of my horizon.|6|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Your Excellencies may, however, readily imagine that the confined regions hitherto unexplored within the limits of the Arctic circle, although situated directly beneath me, and therefore seen without any appearance of being foreshortened, were still, in themselves, comparatively too diminutive, and at too great a distance from the point of sight, to admit of any very accurate examination.|7|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Nevertheless, what could be seen was of a nature singular and exciting.|8|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Northwardly from that huge rim before mentioned, and which, with slight qualification, may be called the limit of human discovery in these regions, one unbroken, or nearly unbroken, sheet of ice continues to extend.|9|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
In the first few degrees of this its progress, its surface is very sensibly flattened, farther on depressed into a plane, and finally, becoming not a little concave, it terminates, at the Pole itself, in a circular centre, sharply defined, wbose apparent diameter subtended at the balloon an angle of about sixty-five seconds, and whose dusky hue, varying in intensity, was, at all times, darker than any other spot upon the visible hemisphere, and occasionally deepened into the most absolute and impenetrable blackness.|10|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Farther than this, little could be ascertained.|11|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
By twelve o'clock the circular centre had materially decreased in circumference, and by seven P.M. I lost sight of it entirely; the balloon passing over the western limb of the ice, and floating away rapidly in the direction of the equator.|12|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
April 8th.|0|56|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Found a sensible diminution in the earth's apparent diameter, besides a material alteration in its general color and appearance.|1|56|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The whole visible area partook in different degrees of a tint of pale yellow, and in some portions had acquired a brilliancy even painful to the eye.|2|56|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
My view downward was also considerably impeded by the dense atmosphere in the vicinity of the surface being loaded with clouds, between whose masses I could only now and then obtain a glimpse of the earth itself.|3|56|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This difficulty of direct vision had troubled me more or less for the last forty-eight hours; but my present enormous elevation brought closer together, as it were, the floating bodies of vapor, and the inconvenience became, of course, more and more palpable in proportion to my ascent.|4|56|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Nevertheless, I could easily perceive that the balloon now hovered above the range of great lakes in the continent of North America, and was holding a course, due south, which would bring me to the tropics.|5|56|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
This circumstance did not fail to give me the most heartful satisfaction, and I hailed it as a happy omen of ultimate success.|6|56|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
"Indeed, the direction I had hitherto taken, had filled me with uneasiness; for it was evident that, had I continued it much longer, there would have been no possibility of my arriving at the moon at all, whose orbit is inclined to the ecliptic at only the small angle of 5 degrees 8' 48""."|7|56|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
April 9th.|0|57|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
To-day the earth's diameter was greatly diminished, and the color of the surface assumed hourly a deeper tint of yellow.|1|57|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
The balloon kept steadily on her course to the southward, and arrived, at nine P.M., over the northern edge of the Mexican Gulf.|2|57|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
April 10th.|0|58|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I was suddenly aroused from slumber, about five o'clock this morning, by a loud, crackling, and terrific sound, for which I could in no manner account.|1|58|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It was of very brief duration, but, while it lasted resembled nothing in the world of which I had any previous experience.|2|58|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It is needless to say that I became excessively alarmed, having, in the first instance, attributed the noise to the bursting of the balloon.|3|58|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
I examined all my apparatus, however, with great attention, and could discover nothing out of order.|4|58|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Spent a great part of the day in meditating upon an occurrence so extraordinary, but could find no means whatever of accounting for it.|5|58|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Went to bed dissatisfied, and in a state of great anxiety and agitation.|6|58|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
April 11th.|0|59|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Found a startling diminution in the apparent diameter of the earth, and a considerable increase, now observable for the first time, in that of the moon itself, which wanted only a few days of being full.|1|59|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
It now required long and excessive labor to condense within the chamber sufficient atmospheric air for the sustenance of life.|2|59|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
April 12th.|0|60|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
A singular alteration took place in regard to the direction of the balloon, and although fully anticipated, afforded me the most unequivocal delight.|1|60|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Having reached, in its former course, about the twentieth parallel of southern latitude, it turned off suddenly, at an acute angle, to the eastward, and thus proceeded throughout the day, keeping nearly, if not altogether, in the exact plane of the lunar elipse.|2|60|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
What was worthy of remark, a very perceptible vacillation in the car was a consequence of this change of route–a vacillation which prevailed, in a more or less degree, for a period of many hours.|3|60|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
April 13th.|0|61|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Was again very much alarmed by a repetition of the loud, crackling noise which terrified me on the tenth.|1|61|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Thought long upon the subject, but was unable to form any satisfactory conclusion.|2|61|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure
Great decrease in the earth's apparent diameter, which now subtended from the balloon an angle of very little more than twenty-five degrees.|3|61|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|June 1835|Adventure

Buckhurst's Tragedy of Ferrex and Porrex.|1|0|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"ABOUT twelve o'clock, one night in the month of October, and during the chivalrous reign of the third Edward, two seamen belonging to the crew of the ""Free and Easy,"" a trading schooner plying between Sluys and the Thames, and then at anchor in that river, were much astonished to find themselves seated in the tap-room of an ale-house in the parish of St. Andrews, London --which ale-house bore for sign the portraiture of a ""Jolly Tar""."|0|1|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
The room, although ill-contrived, smoke-blackened, low-pitched, and in every other respect agreeing with the general character of such places at the period --was, nevertheless, in the opinion of the grotesque groups scattered here and there within it, sufficiently well adapted to its purpose.|0|2|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Of these groups our two seamen formed, I think, the most interesting, if not the most conspicuous.|0|3|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"The one who appeared to be the elder, and whom his companion addressed by the characteristic appellation of ""Legs,"" was at the same time much the taller of the two."|0|4|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
He might have measured six feet and a half, and an habitual stoop in the shoulders seemed to have been the necessary consequence of an altitude so enormous.|1|4|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
--Superfluities in height were, however, more than accounted for by deficiencies in other respects.|2|4|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
He was exceedingly thin; and might, as his associates asserted, have answered, when drunk, for a pennant at the mast-head, or, when sober, have served for a jib-boom.|3|4|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
But these jests, and others of a similar nature, had evidently produced, at no time, any effect upon the cachinnatory muscles of the tar.|4|4|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
With high cheek-bones, a large hawk-nose, retreating chin, fAllan under-jaw, and huge protruding white eyes, the expression of his countenance, although tinged with a species of dogged indifference to matters and things in general, was not the less utterly solemn and serious beyond all attempts at imitation or description.|5|4|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
The younger seaman was, in all outward appearance, the converse of his companion.|0|5|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
His stature could not have exceeded four feet.|1|5|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
A pair of stumpy bow-legs supported his squat, unwieldy figure, while his unusually short and thick arms, with no ordinary fists at their extremities, swung off dangling from his sides like the fins of a sea-turtle.|2|5|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Small eyes, of no particular color, twinkled far back in his head.|3|5|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
His nose remained buried in the mass of flesh which enveloped his round, full, and purple face; and his thick upper-lip rested upon the still thicker one beneath with an air of complacent self-satisfaction, much heightened by the owner's habit of licking them at intervals.|4|5|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
He evidently regarded his tall shipmate with a feeling half-wondrous, half-quizzical; and stared up occasionally in his face as the red setting sun stares up at the crags of Ben Nevis.|5|5|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor

At the precise period, then, when this history properly commences, Legs, and his fellow Hugh Tarpaulin, sat, each with both elbows resting upon the large oaken table in the middle of the floor, and with a hand upon either cheek.|0|7|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"They were eyeing, from behind a huge flagon of unpaid-for ""humming-stuff,"" the portentous words, ""No Chalk,"" which to their indignation and astonishment were scored over the doorway by means of that very mineral whose presence they purported to deny."|1|7|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"Not that the gift of decyphering written characters --a gift among the commonalty of that day considered little less cabalistical than the art of inditing --could, in strict justice, have been laid to the charge of either disciple of the sea; but there was, to say the truth, a certain twist in the formation of the letters --an indescribable lee-lurch about the whole ---which foreboded, in the opinion of both seamen, a long run of dirty weather; and determined them at once, in the allegorical words of Legs himself, to ""pump ship, clew up all sail, and scud before the wind""."|2|7|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Having accordingly disposed of what remained of the ale, and looped up the points of their short doublets, they finally made a bolt for the street.|0|8|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"Although Tarpaulin rolled twice into the fire-place, mistaking it for the door, yet their escape was at length happily effected --and half after twelve o'clock found our heroes ripe for mischief, and running for life down a dark alley in the direction of St. Andrew's Stair, hotly pursued by the landlady of the ""Jolly Tar""."|1|8|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"At the epoch of this eventful tale, and periodically, for many years before and after, all England, but more especially the metropolis, resounded with the fearful cry of ""Plague""!"|0|9|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
The city was in a great measure depopulated --and in those horrible regions, in the vicinity of the Thames, where amid the dark, narrow, and filthy lanes and alleys, the Demon of Disease was supposed to have had his nativity, Awe, Terror, and Superstition were alone to be found stalking abroad.|1|9|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
By authority of the king such districts were placed under ban, and all persons forbidden, under pain of death, to intrude upon their dismal solitude.|0|10|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Yet neither the mandate of the monarch, nor the huge barriers erected at the entrances of the streets, nor the prospect of that loathsome death which, with almost absolute certainty, overwhelmed the wretch whom no peril could deter from the adventure, prevented the unfurnished and untenanted dwellings from being stripped, by the hand of nightly rapine, of every article, such as iron, brass, or lead-work, which could in any manner be turned to a profitable account.|1|10|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Above all, it was usually found, upon the annual winter opening of the barriers, that locks, bolts, and secret cellars, had proved but slender protection to those rich stores of wines and liquors which, in consideration of the risk and trouble of removal, many of the numerous dealers having shops in the neighbourhood had consented to trust, during the period of exile, to so insufficient a security.|0|11|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
But there were very few of the terror-stricken people who attributed these doings to the agency of human hands.|0|12|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Pest-spirits, plague-goblins, and fever-demons, were the popular imps of mischief; and tales so blood-chilling were hourly told, that the whole mass of forbidden buildings was, at length, enveloped in terror as in a shroud, and the plunderer himself was often scared away by the horrors his own depreciations had created; leaving the entire vast circuit of prohibited district to gloom, silence, pestilence, and death.|1|12|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
It was by one of the terrific barriers already mentioned, and which indicated the region beyond to be under the Pest-ban, that, in scrambling down an alley, Legs and the worthy Hugh Tarpaulin found their progress suddenly impeded.|0|13|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
To return was out of the question, and no time was to be lost, as their pursuers were close upon their heels.|1|13|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
With thorough-bred seamen to clamber up the roughly fashioned plank-work was a trifle; and, maddened with the twofold excitement of exercise and liquor, they leaped unhesitatingly down within the enclosure, and holding on their drunken course with shouts and yellings, were soon bewildered in its noisome and intricate recesses.|2|13|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Had they not, indeed, been intoxicated beyond moral sense, their reeling footsteps must have been palsied by the horrors of their situation.|0|14|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor

The most fetid and poisonous smells everywhere prevailed; --and by the aid of that ghastly light which, even at midnight, never fails to emanate from a vapory and pestilential at atmosphere, might be discerned lying in the by-paths and alleys, or rotting in the windowless habitations, the carcass of many a nocturnal plunderer arrested by the hand of the plague in the very perpetration of his robbery.|4|14|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor

would have reeled, as straight as their condition might have permitted, undauntedly into the very jaws of Death.|1|15|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Onward --still onward stalked the grim Legs, making the desolate solemnity echo and re-echo with yells like the terrific war-whoop of the Indian: and onward, still onward rolled the dumpy Tarpaulin, hanging on to the doublet of his more active companion, and far surpassing the latter's most strenuous exertions in the way of vocal music, by bull-roarings in basso, from the profundity of his stentorian lungs.|2|15|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor

Their way at every step or plunge grew more noisome and more horrible --the paths more narrow and more intricate.|1|16|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Huge stones and beams falling momently from the decaying roofs above them, gave evidence, by their sullen and heavy descent, of the vast height of the surrounding houses; and while actual exertion became necessary to force a passage through frequent heaps of rubbish, it was by no means seldom that the hand fell upon a skeleton or rested upon a more fleshly corpse.|2|16|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Suddenly, as the seamen stumbled against the entrance of a tall and ghastly-looking building, a yell more than usually shrill from the throat of the excited Legs, was replied to from within, in a rapid succession of wild, laughter-like, and fiendish shrieks.|0|17|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Nothing daunted at sounds which, of such a nature, at such a time, and in such a place, might have curdled the very blood in hearts less irrevocably on fire, the drunken couple rushed headlong against the door, burst it open, and staggered into the midst of things with a volley of curses.|1|17|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
The room within which they found themselves proved to be the shop of an undertaker; but an open trap-door, in a corner of the floor near the entrance, looked down upon a long range of wine-cellars, whose depths the occasional sound of bursting bottles proclaimed to be well stored with their appropriate contents.|0|18|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
In the middle of the room stood a table --in the centre of which again arose a huge tub of what appeared to be punch.|1|18|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Bottles of various wines and cordials, together with jugs, pitchers, and flagons of every shape and quality, were scattered profusely upon the board.|2|18|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Around it, upon coffin-tressels, was seated a company of six.|3|18|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
This company I will endeavor to delineate one by one.|4|18|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Fronting the entrance, and elevated a little above his companions, sat a personage who appeared to be the president of the table.|0|19|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
His stature was gaunt and tall, and Legs was confounded to behold in him a figure more emaciated than himself.|1|19|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
His face was as yellow as saffron --but no feature excepting one alone, was sufficiently marked to merit a particular description.|2|19|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
This one consisted in a forehead so unusually and hideously lofty, as to have the appearance of a bonnet or crown of flesh superadded upon the natural head.|3|19|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
His mouth was puckered and dimpled into an expression of ghastly affability, and his eyes, as indeed the eyes of all at table, were glazed over with the fumes of intoxication.|4|19|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
This gentleman was clothed from head to foot in a richly-embroidered black silk-velvet pall, wrapped negligently around his form after the fashion of a Spanish cloak.|5|19|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
--His head was stuck full of sable hearse-plumes, which he nodded to and fro with a jaunty and knowing air; and, in his right hand, he held a huge human thigh-bone, with which he appeared to have been just knocking down some member of the company for a song.|6|19|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Opposite him, and with her back to the door, was a lady of no whit the less extraordinary character.|0|20|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Although quite as tall as the person just described, she had no right to complain of his unnatural emaciation.|1|20|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
She was evidently in the last stage of a dropsy; and her figure resembled nearly that of the huge puncheon of October beer which stood, with the head driven in, close by her side, in a corner of the chamber.|2|20|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Her face was exceedingly round, red, and full; and the same peculiarity, or rather want of peculiarity, attached itself to her countenance, which I before mentioned in the case of the president --that is to say, only one feature of her face was sufficiently distinguished to need a separate characterization: indeed the acute Tarpaulin immediately observed that the same remark might have applied to each individual person of the party; every one of whom seemed to possess a monopoly of some particular portion of physiognomy.|3|20|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
With the lady in question this portion proved to be the mouth.|4|20|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Commencing at the right ear, it swept with a terrific chasm to the left --the short pendants which she wore in either auricle continually bobbing into the aperture.|5|20|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
She made, however, every exertion to keep her mouth closed and look dignified, in a dress consisting of a newly starched and ironed shroud coming up close under her chin, with a crimpled ruffle of cambric muslin.|6|20|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
At her right hand sat a diminutive young lady whom she appeared to patronise.|0|21|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
This delicate little creature, in the trembling of her wasted fingers, in the livid hue of her lips, and in the slight hectic spot which tinged her otherwise leaden complexion, gave evident indications of a galloping consumption.|1|21|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
An air of gave extreme haut ton, however, pervaded her whole appearance; she wore in a graceful and degage manner, a large and beautiful winding-sheet of the finest India lawn; her hair hung in ringlets over her neck; a soft smile played about her mouth; but her nose, extremely long, thin, sinuous, flexible and pimpled, hung down far below her under lip, and in spite of the delicate manner in which she now and then moved it to one side or the other with her tongue, gave to her countenance a somewhat equivocal expression.|2|21|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Over against her, and upon the left of the dropsical lady, was seated a little puffy, wheezing, and gouty old man, whose cheeks reposed upon the shoulders of their owner, like two huge bladders of Oporto wine.|0|22|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
With his arms folded, and with one bandaged leg deposited upon the table, he seemed to think himself entitled to some consideration.|1|22|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
He evidently prided himself much upon every inch of his personal appearance, but took more especial delight in calling attention to his gaudy-colored surtout.|2|22|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
This, to say the truth, must have cost him no little money, and was made to fit him exceedingly well --being fashioned from one of the curiously embroidered silken covers appertaining to those glorious escutcheons which, in England and elsewhere, are customarily hung up, in some conspicuous place, upon the dwellings of departed aristocracy.|3|22|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Next to him, and at the right hand of the president, was a gentleman in long white hose and cotton drawers.|0|23|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"His frame shook, in a ridiculous manner, with a fit of what Tarpaulin called ""the horrors""."|1|23|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
His jaws, which had been newly shaved, were tightly tied up by a bandage of muslin; and his arms being fastened in a similar way at the wrists, I I prevented him from helping himself too freely to the liquors upon the table; a precaution rendered necessary, in the opinion of Legs, by the peculiarly sottish and wine-bibbing cast of his visage.|2|23|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
A pair of prodigious ears, nevertheless, which it was no doubt found impossible to confine, towered away into the atmosphere of the apartment, and were occasionally pricked up in a spasm, at the sound of the drawing of a cork.|3|23|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Fronting him, sixthly and lastly, was situated a singularly stiff-looking personage, who, being afflicted with paralysis, must, to speak seriously, have felt very ill at ease in his unaccommodating habiliments.|0|24|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
He was habited, somewhat uniquely, in a new and handsome mahogany coffin.|1|24|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Its top or head-piece pressed upon the skull of the wearer, and extended over it in the fashion of a hood, giving to the entire face an air of indescribable interest.|2|24|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Arm-holes had been cut in the sides, for the sake not more of elegance than of convenience; but the dress, nevertheless, prevented its proprietor from sitting as erect as his associates; and as he lay reclining against his tressel, at an angle of forty-five degrees, a pair of huge goggle eyes rolled up their awful whites towards the celling in absolute amazement at their own enormity.|3|24|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Before each of the party lay a portion of a skull, which was used as a drinking cup.|0|25|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Overhead was suspended a human skeleton, by means of a rope tied round one of the legs and fastened to a ring in the ceiling.|1|25|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
The other limb, confined by no such fetter, stuck off from the body at right angles, causing the whole loose and rattling frame to dangle and twirl about at the caprice of every occasional puff of wind which found its way into the apartment.|2|25|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
In the cranium of this hideous thing lay quantity of ignited charcoal, which threw a fitful but vivid light over the entire scene; while coffins, and other wares appertaining to the shop of an undertaker, were piled high up around the room, and against the windows, preventing any ray from escaping into the street.|3|25|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
At sight of this extraordinary assembly, and of their still more extraordinary paraphernalia, our two seamen did not conduct themselves with that degree of decorum which might have been expected.|0|26|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Legs, leaning against the wall near which he happened to be standing, dropped his lower jaw still lower than usual, and spread open his eyes to their fullest extent: while Hugh Tarpaulin, stooping down so as to bring his nose upon a level with the table, and spreading out a palm upon either knee, burst into a long, loud, and obstreperous roar of very ill-timed and immoderate laughter.|1|26|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Without, however, taking offence at behaviour so excessively rude, the tall president smiled very graciously upon the intruders --nodded to them in a dignified manner with his head of sable plumes --and, arising, took each by an arm, and led him to a seat which some others of the company had placed in the meantime for his accommodation.|0|27|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Legs to all this offered not the slightest resistance, but sat down as he was directed; while tile gallant Hugh, removing his coffin tressel from its station near the head of the table, to the vicinity of the little consumptive lady in the winding sheet, plumped down by her side in high glee, and pouring out a skull of red wine, quaffed it to their better acquaintance.|1|27|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"""Avast there""!"|0|29|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"interrupted Legs, looking very serious, ""avast there a bit, I say, and tell us who the devil ye all are, and what business ye have here, rigged off like the foul fiends, and swilling the snug blue ruin stowed away for the winter by my honest shipmate, Will Wimble the undertaker""!"|1|29|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
At this unpardonable piece of ill-breeding, all the original company half started to their feet, and uttered the same rapid succession of wild fiendish shrieks which had before caught the attention of the seamen.|0|30|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"""Most willingly will we gratify any reasonable curiosity on the part of guests so illustrious, unbidden though they be."|0|31|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Know then that in these dominions I am monarch, and here rule with undivided empire under the title of 'King Pest the First.|1|31|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"""This apartment, which you no doubt profanely suppose to be the shop of Will Wimble the undertaker --a man whom we know not, and whose plebeian appellation has never before this night thwarted our royal ears --this apartment, I say, is the Dais-Chamber of our Palace, devoted to the councils of our kingdom, and to other sacred and lofty purposes."|0|32|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"""The noble lady who sits opposite is Queen Pest, our Serene Consort."|0|33|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
The other exalted personages whom you behold are all of our family, and wear the insignia of the blood royal under the respective titles of 'His Grace the Arch Duke Pest-Iferous' --'His Grace the Duke Pest-Ilential' --'His Grace the Duke Tem-Pest' --and 'Her Serene Highness the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest.|1|33|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"""As regards,"" continued he, ""your demand of the business upon which we sit here in council, we might be pardoned for replying that it concerns, and concerns alone, our own private and regal interest, and is in no manner important to any other than ourself."|0|34|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
But in consideration of those rights to which as guests and strangers you may feel yourselves entitled, we will furthermore explain that we are here this night, prepared by deep research and accurate investigation, to examine, analyze, and thoroughly determine the indefinable spirit --the incomprehensible qualities and nature --of those inestimable treasures of the palate, the wines, ales, and liqueurs of this goodly metropolis: by so doing to advance not more our own designs than the true welfare of that unearthly sovereign whose reign is over us all, whose dominions are unlimited, and whose name is 'Death.|1|34|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"""Whose name is Davy Jones""!"|0|35|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
ejaculated Tarpaulin, helping the lady by his side to a skull of liqueur, and pouring out a second for himself.|1|35|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"""Profane varlet""!"|0|36|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"said the president, now turning his attention to the worthy Hugh, ""profane and execrable wretch!"|1|36|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
--we have said, that in consideration of those rights which, even in thy filthy person, we feel no inclination to violate, we have condescended to make reply to thy rude and unseasonable inquiries.|2|36|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"We nevertheless, for your unhallowed intrusion upon our councils, believe it our duty to mulct thee and thy companion in each a gallon of Black Strap --having imbibed which to the prosperity of our kingdom --at a single draught --and upon your bended knees --ye shall be forthwith free either to proceed upon your way, or remain and be admitted to the privileges of our table, according to your respective and individual pleasures""."|3|36|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"""It would be a matter of utter impossibility,"" replied Legs, whom the assumptions and dignity of King Pest the First had evidently inspired some feelings of respect, and who arose and steadied himself by the table as he spoke --""It would, please your majesty, be a matter of utter impossibility to stow away in my hold even one-fourth part of the same liquor which your majesty has just mentioned."|0|37|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
To say nothing of the stuffs placed on board in the forenoon by way of ballast, and not to mention the various ales and liqueurs shipped this evening at different sea-ports, I have, at present, a full cargo of 'humming stuff' taken in and duly paid for at the sign of the 'Jolly Tar.|1|37|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
' You will, therefore, please your majesty, be so good as to take the will for the deed --for by no manner of means either can I or will I swallow another drop --least of all a drop of that villainous bilge-water that answers to the hall of 'Black Strap.|2|37|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"""Belay that""!"|0|38|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"interrupted Tarpaulin, astonished not more at the length of his companion's speech than at the nature of his refusal --""Belay that you tubber!"|1|38|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
--and I say, Legs, none of your palaver!|2|38|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"""This proceeding,"" interposed the president, ""is by no means in accordance with the terms of the mulct or sentence, which is in its nature Median, and not to be altered or recalled."|0|39|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"The conditions we have imposed must be fulfilled to the letter, and that without a moment's hesitation --in failure of which fulfilment we decree that you do here be tied neck and heels together, and duly drowned as rebels in yon hogshead of October beer""!"|1|39|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"""A sentence!"|0|40|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor

"--a most worthy and upright, and holy condemnation""!"|4|40|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
shouted the Pest family altogether.|5|40|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
The king elevated his forehead into innumerable wrinkles; the gouty little old man puffed like a pair of bellows; the lady of the winding sheet waved her nose to and fro; the gentleman in the cotton drawers pricked up his ears; she of the shroud gasped like a dying fish; and he of the coffin looked stiff and rolled up his eyes.|6|40|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"""Ugh!"|0|41|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor

"--I was saying,"" said he, ""I was saying when Mr. King Pest poked in his marlin-spike, that as for the matter of two or three gallons more or less of Black Strap, it was a trifle to a tight sea-boat like myself not overstowed --but when it comes to drinking the health of the Devil (whom God assoilzie) and going down upon my marrow bones to his ill-favored majesty there, whom I know, as well as I know myself to be a sinner, to be nobody in the whole world, but Tim Hurlygurly the stage-player --why!"|12|41|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"it's quite another guess sort of a thing, and utterly and altogether past my comprehension""."|13|41|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
He was not allowed to finish this speech in tranquillity.|0|42|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
At the name Tim Hurlygurly the whole assembly leaped from their name seats.|1|42|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor

"""Treason!"|0|48|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"treason""!"|1|48|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
shrieked her majesty of the mouth; and, seizing by the hinder part of his breeches the unfortunate Tarpaulin, who had just commenced pouring out for himself a skull of liqueur, she lifted him high into the air, and let him fall without ceremony into the huge open puncheon of his beloved ale.|2|48|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Bobbing up and down, for a few seconds, like an apple in a bowl of toddy, he, at length, finally disappeared amid the whirlpool of foam which, in the already effervescent liquor, his struggles easily succeeded in creating.|3|48|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Not tamely, however, did the tall seaman behold the discomfiture of his companion.|0|49|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Jostling King Pest through the open trap, the valiant Legs slammed the door down upon him with an oath, and strode towards the centre of the room.|1|49|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Here tearing down the skeleton which swung over the table, he laid it about him with so much energy and good will, that, as the last glimpses of light died away within the apartment, he succeeded in knocking out the brains of the little gentleman with the gout.|2|49|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Rushing then with all his force against the fatal hogshead full of October ale and Hugh Tarpaulin, he rolled it over and over in an instant.|3|49|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Out burst a deluge of liquor so fierce --so impetuous --so overwhelming --that the room was flooded from wall to wall --the loaded table was overturned --the tressels were thrown upon their backs --the tub of punch into the fire-place --and the ladies into hysterics.|4|49|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Piles of death-furniture floundered about.|5|49|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Jugs, pitchers, and carboys mingled promiscuously in the melee, and wicker flagons encountered desperately with bottles of junk.|6|49|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
"The man with the horrors was drowned upon the spot-the little stiff gentleman floated off in his coffin --and the victorious Legs, seizing by the waist the fat lady in the shroud, rushed out with her into the street, and made a bee-line for the ""Free and Easy,"" followed under easy sail by the redoubtable Hugh Tarpaulin, who, having sneezed three or four times, panted and puffed after him with the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest."|7|49|King Pest|September 1835|Horror / Humor
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the Shadow: Psalm of David.|0|0|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
YE who read are still among the living; but I who write shall have long since gone my way into the region of shadows.|0|1|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
For indeed strange things shall happen, and secret things be known, and many centuries shall pass away, ere these memorials be seen of men.|1|1|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
And, when seen, there will be some to disbelieve, and some to doubt, and yet a few who will find much to ponder upon in the characters here graven with a stylus of iron.|2|1|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
The year had been a year of terror, and of feelings more intense than terror for which there is no name upon the earth.|0|2|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
For many prodigies and signs had taken place, and far and wide, over sea and land, the black wings of the Pestilence were spread abroad.|1|2|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
To those, nevertheless, cunning in the stars, it was not unknown that the heavens wore an aspect of ill; and to me, the Greek Oinos, among others, it was evident that now had arrived the alternation of that seven hundred and ninety-fourth year when, at the entrance of Aries, the planet Jupiter is conjoined with the red ring of the terrible Saturnus.|2|2|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
The peculiar spirit of the skies, if I mistake not greatly, made itself manifest, not only in the physical orb of the earth, but in the souls, imaginations, and meditations of mankind.|3|2|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
Over some flasks of the red Chian wine, within the walls of a noble hall, in a dim city called Ptolemais, we sat, at night, a company of seven.|0|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
And to our chamber there was no entrance save by a lofty door of brass: and the door was fashioned by the artisan Corinnos, and, being of rare workmanship, was fastened from within.|1|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
Black draperies, likewise, in the gloomy room, shut out from our view the moon, the lurid stars, and the peopleless streets–but the boding and the memory of Evil they would not be so excluded.|2|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
There were things around us and about of which I can render no distinct account–things material and spiritual–heaviness in the atmosphere–a sense of suffocation–anxiety–and, above all, that terrible state of existence which the nervous experience when the senses are keenly living and awake, and meanwhile the powers of thought lie dormant.|3|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
A dead weight hung upon us.|4|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
It hung upon our limbs–upon the household furniture–upon the goblets from which we drank; and all things were depressed, and borne down thereby–all things save only the flames of the seven lamps which illumined our revel.|5|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
Uprearing themselves in tall slender lines of light, they thus remained burning all pallid and motionless; and in the mirror which their lustre formed upon the round table of ebony at which we sat, each of us there assembled beheld the pallor of his own countenance, and the unquiet glare in the downcast eyes of his companions.|6|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
Yet we laughed and were merry in our proper way–which was hysterical; and sang the songs of Anacreon–which are madness; and drank deeply–although the purple wine reminded us of blood.|7|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
For there was yet another tenant of our chamber in the person of young Zoilus.|8|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
Dead, and at full length he lay, enshrouded; the genius and the demon of the scene.|9|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
Alas!|10|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
he bore no portion in our mirth, save that his countenance, distorted with the plague, and his eyes, in which Death had but half extinguished the fire of the pestilence, seemed to take such interest in our merriment as the dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to die.|11|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
But although I, Oinos, felt that the eyes of the departed were upon me, still I forced myself not to perceive the bitterness of their expression, and gazing down steadily into the depths of the ebony mirror, sang with a loud and sonorous voice the songs of the son of Teios.|12|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
But gradually my songs they ceased, and their echoes, rolling afar off among the sable draperies of the chamber, became weak, and undistinguishable, and so faded away.|13|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
And lo!|14|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
from among those sable draperies where the sounds of the song departed, there came forth a dark and undefined shadow–a shadow such as the moon, when low in heaven, might fashion from the figure of a man: but it was the shadow neither of man nor of God, nor of any familiar thing.|15|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
And quivering awhile among the draperies of the room, it at length rested in full view upon the surface of the door of brass.|16|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
But the shadow was vague, and formless, and indefinite, and was the shadow neither of man nor of God–neither God of Greece, nor God of Chaldaea, nor any Egyptian God.|17|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
And the shadow rested upon the brazen doorway, and under the arch of the entablature of the door, and moved not, nor spoke any word, but there became stationary and remained.|18|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
And the door whereupon the shadow rested was, if I remember aright, over against the feet of the young Zoilus enshrouded.|19|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
But we, the seven there assembled, having seen the shadow as it came out from among the draperies, dared not steadily behold it, but cast down our eyes, and gazed continually into the depths of the mirror of ebony.|20|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
And at length I, Oinos, speaking some low words, demanded of the shadow its dwelling and its appellation.|21|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
"And the shadow answered, ""I am SHADOW, and my dwelling is near to the Catacombs of Ptolemais, and hard by those dim plains of Helusion which border upon the foul Charonian canal""."|22|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror
And then did we, the seven, start from our seats in horror, and stand trembling, and shuddering, and aghast, for the tones in the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one being, but of a multitude of beings, and, varying in their cadences from syllable to syllable fell duskly upon our ears in the well-remembered and familiar accents of many thousand departed friends.|23|3|Shadow—A Parable|September 1835|Horror

NED KNOWLES.|1|0|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
THE BARON RITZNER VON JUNG was a noble Hungarian family, every member of which (at least as far back into antiquity as any certain records extend) was more or less remarkable for talent of some description–the majority for that species of grotesquerie in conception of which Tieck, a scion of the house, has given a vivid, although by no means the most vivid exemplifications.|0|1|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
My acquaintance with Ritzner commenced at the magnificent Chateau Jung, into which a train of droll adventures, not to be made public, threw a place in his regard, and here, with somewhat more difficulty, a partial insight into his mental conformation.|1|1|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
In later days this insight grew more clear, as the intimacy which had at first permitted it became more close; and when, after three years of the character of the Baron Ritzner von Jung.|2|1|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
I remember the buzz of curiosity which his advent excited within the college precincts on the night of the twenty-fifth of June.|0|2|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
"I remember still more distinctly, that while he was pronounced by all parties at first sight ""the most remarkable man in the world,"" no person made any attempt at accounting for his opinion."|1|2|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
That he was unique appeared so undeniable, that it was deemed impertinent to inquire wherein the uniquity consisted.|2|2|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
But, letting this matter pass for the present, I will merely observe that, from the first moment of his setting foot within the limits of the university, he began to exercise over the habits, manners, persons, purses, and propensities of the whole community which surrounded him, an influence the most extensive and despotic, yet at the same time the most indefinite and altogether unaccountable.|3|2|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
"Thus the brief period of his residence at the university forms an era in its annals, and is characterized by all classes of people appertaining to it or its dependencies as ""that very extraordinary epoch forming the domination of the Baron Ritzner von Jung""."|4|2|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
then of no particular age, by which I mean that it was impossible to form a guess respecting his age by any data personally afforded.|5|2|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
He might have been fifteen or fifty, and was twenty-one years and seven months.|6|2|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
He was by no means a handsome man–perhaps the reverse.|7|2|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
The contour of his face was somewhat angular and harsh.|8|2|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
His forehead was lofty and very fair; his nose a snub; his eyes large, heavy, glassy, and meaningless.|9|2|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
About the mouth there was more to be observed.|10|2|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
The lips were gently protruded, and rested the one upon the other, after such a fashion that it is impossible to conceive any, even the most complex, combination of human features, conveying so entirely, and so singly, the idea of unmitigated gravity, solemnity and repose.|11|2|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
It will be perceived, no doubt, from what I have already said, that the Baron was one of those human anomalies now and then to be found, who make the science of mystification the study and the business of their lives.|0|3|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
For this science a peculiar turn of mind gave him instinctively the cue, while his physical appearance afforded him unusual facilities for carrying his prospects into effect.|1|3|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
I quaintly termed the domination of the Baron Ritzner von Jung, ever rightly entered into the mystery which overshadowed his character.|2|3|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
I truly think that no person at the university, with the exception of myself, ever suspected him to be capable of a joke, verbal or practical:–the old bull-dog at the garden-gate would sooner have been accused,–the ghost of Heraclitus,–or the wig of the Emeritus Professor of Theology.|3|3|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
This, too, when it was evident that the most egregious and unpardonable of all conceivable tricks, whimsicalities and buffooneries were brought about, if not directly by him, at least plainly through his intermediate agency or connivance.|4|3|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
The beauty, if I may so call it, of his art mystifique, lay in that consummate ability (resulting from an almost intuitive knowledge of human nature, and a most wonderful self-possession,) by means of which he never failed to make it appear that the drolleries he was occupied in bringing to a point, arose partly in spite, and partly in consequence of the laudable efforts he was making for their prevention, and for the preservation of the good order and dignity of Alma Mater.|5|3|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
The deep, the poignant, the overwhelming mortification, which upon each such failure of his praise worthy endeavors, would suffuse every lineament of his countenance, left not the slightest room for doubt of his sincerity in the bosoms of even his most skeptical companions.|6|3|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
The adroitness, too, was no less worthy of observation by which he contrived to shift the sense of the grotesque from the creator to the created–from his own person to the absurdities to which he had given rise.|7|3|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
In no instance before that of which I speak, have I known the habitual mystific escape the natural consequence of his manoevres–an attachment of the ludicrous to his own character and person.|8|3|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
Continually enveloped in an atmosphere of whim, my friend appeared to live only for the severities of society; and not even his own household have for a moment associated other ideas than those of the rigid and august with the memory of the Baron Ritzner von Jung.|9|3|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
the demon of the dolce far niente lay like an incubus upon the university.|10|3|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
Nothing, at least, was done beyond eating and drinking and making merry.|11|3|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
The apartments of the students were converted into so many pot-houses, and there was no pot-house of them all more famous or more frequented than that of the Baron.|12|3|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
Our carousals here were many, and boisterous, and long, and never unfruitful of events.|13|3|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
Upon one occasion we had protracted our sitting until nearly daybreak, and an unusual quantity of wine had been drunk.|0|4|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
The company consisted of seven or eight individuals besides the Baron and myself.|1|4|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
Most of these were young men of wealth, of high connection, of great family pride, and all alive with an exaggerated sense of honor.|2|4|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
They abounded in the most ultra German opinions respecting the duello.|3|4|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
To these Quixotic notions some recent Parisian publications, backed by three or four desperate and fatal conversation, during the greater part of the night, had run wild upon the all–engrossing topic of the times.|4|4|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
The Baron, who had been unusually silent and abstracted in the earlier portion of the evening, at length seemed to be aroused from his apathy, took a leading part in the discourse, and dwelt upon the benefits, and more especially upon the beauties, of the received code of etiquette in passages of arms with an ardor, an eloquence, an impressiveness, and an affectionateness of manner, which elicited the warmest enthusiasm from his hearers in general, and absolutely staggered even myself, who well knew him to be at heart a ridiculer of those very points for which he contended, and especially to hold the entire fanfaronade of duelling etiquette in the sovereign contempt which it deserves.|5|4|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
Looking around me during a pause in the Baron's discourse (of which my readers may gather some faint idea when I say that it bore resemblance to the fervid, chanting, monotonous, yet musical sermonic manner of Coleridge), I perceived symptoms of even more than the general interest in the countenance of one of the party.|0|5|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
This gentleman, whom I shall call Hermann, was an original in every respect–except, perhaps, in the single particular that he was a very great fool.|1|5|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
He contrived to bear, however, among a particular set at the university, a reputation for deep metaphysical thinking, and, I believe, for some logical talent.|2|5|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
As a duellist he had acquired who had fAllan at his hands; but they were many.|3|5|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
He was a man of courage undoubtedly.|4|5|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
But it was upon his minute acquaintance with the etiquette of the duello, and the nicety of his sense of honor, that he most especially prided himself.|5|5|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
These things were a hobby which he rode to the death.|6|5|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
To Ritzner, ever upon the lookout for the grotesque, his peculiarities had for a long time past afforded food for mystification.|7|5|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
Of this, however, I was not aware; although, in the present instance, I saw clearly that something of a whimsical nature was upon the tapis with my friend, and that Hermann was its especial object.|8|5|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
As the former proceeded in his discourse, or rather monologue I perceived the excitement of the latter momently increasing.|0|6|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
At length he spoke; offering some objection to a point insisted upon by R., and giving his reasons in detail.|1|6|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
To these the Baron replied at length (still maintaining his exaggerated tone of sentiment) and concluding, in what I thought very bad taste, with a sarcasm and a sneer.|2|6|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
The hobby of Hermann now took the bit in his teeth.|3|6|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
This I could discern by the studied hair-splitting farrago of his rejoinder.|4|6|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
His last words I distinctly remember.|5|6|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
"""Your opinions, allow me to say, Baron von Jung, although in the main correct, are, in many nice points, discreditable to yourself and to the university of which you are a member."|6|6|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
In a few respects they are even unworthy of serious refutation.|7|6|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
"I would say more than this, sir, were it not for the fear of giving you offence (here the speaker smiled blandly), I would say, sir, that your opinions are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman""."|8|6|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
As Hermann completed this equivocal sentence, all eyes were turned upon the Baron.|0|7|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
He became pale, then excessively red; then, dropping his pocket-handkerchief, stooped to recover it, when I caught a glimpse of his countenance, while it could be seen by no one else at the table.|1|7|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
It was radiant with the quizzical expression which was its natural character, but which I had never seen it assume except when we were alone together, and when he unbent himself freely.|2|7|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
In an instant afterward he stood erect, confronting Hermann; and so total an alteration of countenance in so short a period I certainly never saw before.|3|7|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
For a moment I even fancied that I had misconceived him, and that he was in sober earnest.|4|7|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
He appeared to be stifling with passion, and his face was cadaverously white.|5|7|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
For a short time he remained silent, apparently striving to master his emotion.|6|7|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
"Having at length seemingly succeeded, he reached a decanter which stood near him, saying as he held it firmly clenched ""The language you have thought proper to employ, Mynheer Hermann, in addressing yourself to me, is objectionable in so many particulars, that I have neither temper nor time for specification."|7|7|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
That my opinions, however, are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman, is an observation so directly offensive as to allow me but one line of conduct.|8|7|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
Some courtesy, nevertheless, is due to the presence of this company, and to yourself, at this moment, as my guest.|9|7|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
You will pardon me, therefore, if, upon this consideration, I deviate slightly from the general usage among gentlemen in similar cases of personal affront.|10|7|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
You will forgive me for the moderate tax I shall make upon your imagination, and endeavor to consider, for an instant, the reflection of your person in yonder mirror as the living Mynheer Hermann himself.|11|7|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
This being done, there will be no difficulty whatever.|12|7|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
"I shall discharge this decanter of wine at your image in yonder mirror, and thus fulfil all the spirit, if not the exact letter, of resentment for your insult, while the necessity of physical violence to your real person will be obviated""."|13|7|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
With these words he hurled the decanter, full of wine, against the mirror which hung directly opposite Hermann; striking the reflection of his person with great precision, and of course shattering the glass into fragments.|0|8|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
The whole company at once started to their feet, and, with the exception of myself and Ritzner, took their departure.|1|8|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
As Hermann went out, the Baron whispered me that I should follow him and make an offer of my services.|2|8|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
To this I agreed; not knowing precisely what to make of so ridiculous a piece of business.|3|8|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
The duellist accepted my aid with his stiff and ultra recherche air, and, taking my arm, led me to his apartment.|0|9|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
"I could hardly forbear laughing in his face while he proceeded to discuss, with the profoundest gravity, what he termed ""the refinedly peculiar character"" of the insult he had received."|1|9|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
After a tiresome harangue in his ordinary style, he took down from his book shelves a number of musty volumes on the subject of the duello, and entertained me for a long time with their contents; reading aloud, and commenting earnestly as he read.|2|9|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
I can just remember the titles of some of the works.|3|9|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
"There were the ""Ordonnance of Philip le Bel on Single Combat""; the ""Theatre of Honor,"" by Favyn, and a treatise ""On the Permission of Duels,"" by Andiguier."|4|9|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
"He displayed, also, with much pomposity, Brantome's ""Memoirs of Duels,""–published at Cologne, 1666, in the types of Elzevir–a precious and unique vellum-paper volume, with a fine margin, and bound by Derome."|5|9|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
"But he requested my attention particularly, and with an air of mysterious sagacity, to a thick octavo, written in barbarous Latin by one Hedelin, a Frenchman, and having the quaint title, ""Duelli Lex Scripta, et non; aliterque""."|6|9|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
"From this he read me one of the drollest chapters in the world concerning ""Injuriae per applicationem, per constructionem, et per se,"" about half of which, he averred, was strictly applicable to his own ""refinedly peculiar"" case, although not one syllable of the whole matter could I understand for the life of me."|7|9|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
Having finished the chapter, he closed the book, and demanded what I thought necessary to be done.|8|9|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
I replied that I had entire confidence in his superior delicacy of feeling, and would abide by what he proposed.|9|9|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
With this answer he seemed flattered, and sat down to write a note to the Baron.|10|9|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
Sir,–My friend, M. P.-, will hand you this note.|0|10|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
I find it incumbent upon me to request, at your earliest convenience, an explanation of this evening's occurrences at your chambers.|1|10|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
In the event of your declining this request, Mr. P. will be happy to arrange, with any friend whom you may appoint, the steps preliminary to a meeting.|2|10|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
JOHANN HERMAN.|0|13|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
Not knowing what better to do, I called upon Ritzner with this epistle.|0|15|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
He bowed as I presented it; then, with a grave countenance, motioned me to a seat.|1|15|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
Having perused the cartel, he wrote the following reply, which I carried to Hermann.|2|15|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
SIR,–Through our common friend, Mr. P., I have received your note of this evening.|0|16|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
Upon due reflection I frankly admit the propriety of the explanation you suggest.|1|16|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
This being admitted, I still find great difficulty, (owing to the refinedly peculiar nature of our disagreement, and of the personal affront offered on my part,) in so wording what I have to say by way of apology, as to meet all the minute exigencies, and all the variable shadows, of the case.|2|16|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
I have great reliance, however, on that extreme delicacy of discrimination, in matters appertaining to the rules of etiquette, for which you have been so long and so pre-eminently distinguished.|3|16|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
"With perfect certainty, therefore, of being comprehended, I beg leave, in lieu of offering any sentiments of my own, to refer you to the opinions of Sieur Hedelin, as set forth in the ninth paragraph of the chapter of ""Injuriae per applicationem, per constructionem, et per se,"" in his ""Duelli Lex scripta, et non; aliterque""."|4|16|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
The nicety of your discernment in all the matters here treated, will be sufficient, I am assured, to convince you that the mere circumstance of me referring you to this admirable passage, ought to satisfy your request, as a man of honor, for explanation.|5|16|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
With sentiments of profound respect, Your most obedient servant, VON JUNG.|0|17|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
Hermann commenced the perusal of this epistle with a scowl, which, however, was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous self-complacency as he came to the rigmarole about Injuriae per applicationem, per constructionem, et per se.|0|19|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
Having finished reading, he begged me, with the blandest of all possible smiles, to be seated, while he made reference to the treatise in question.|1|19|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
Turning to the passage specified, he read it with great care to himself, then closed the book, and desired me, in my character of confidential acquaintance, to express to the Baron von Jung his exalted sense of his chivalrous behavior, and, in that of second, to assure him that the explanation offered was of the fullest, the most honorable, and the most unequivocally satisfactory nature.|2|19|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
Somewhat amazed at all this, I made my retreat to the Baron.|0|20|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
"He seemed to receive Hermann's amicable letter as a matter of course, and after a few words of general conversation, went to an inner room and brought out the everlasting treatise ""Duelli Lex scripta, et non; aliterque""."|1|20|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
He handed me the volume and asked me to look over some portion of it.|2|20|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
I did so, but to little purpose, not being able to gather the least particle of meaning.|3|20|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
He then took the book himself, and read me a chapter aloud.|4|20|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
To my surprise, what he read proved to be a most horribly absurd account of a duel between two baboons.|5|20|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
He now explained the mystery; showing that the volume, as it appeared prima facie, was written upon the plan of the nonsense verses of Du Bartas; that is to say, the language was ingeniously framed so as to present to the ear all the outward signs of intelligibility, and even of profundity, while in fact not a shadow of meaning existed.|6|20|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
The key to the whole was found in leaving out every second and third word alternately, when there appeared a series of ludicrous quizzes upon a single combat as practised in modern times.|7|20|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
The Baron afterwards informed me that he had purposely thrown the treatise in Hermann's way two or three weeks before the adventure, and that he was satisfied, from the general tenor of his conversation, that he had studied it with the deepest attention, and firmly believed it to be a work of unusual merit.|0|21|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
Upon this hint he proceeded.|1|21|Mystification|June 1837|Humor
Hermann would have died a thousand deaths rather than acknowledge his inability to understand anything and everything in the universe that had ever been written about the duello.|2|21|Mystification|June 1837|Humor

But there is no wind throughout the heaven.|7|3|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And by the shores of the river Zaire there is neither quiet nor silence.|8|3|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
"""It was night, and the rain fell; and falling, it was rain, but, having fAllan, it was blood."|0|4|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And I stood in the morass among the tall and the rain fell upon my head --and the lilies sighed one unto the other in the solemnity of their desolation.|1|4|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
"""And, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist, and was crimson in color."|0|5|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood by the shore of the river, and was lighted by the light of the moon.|1|5|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And the rock was gray, and ghastly, and tall, --and the rock was gray.|2|5|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
Upon its front were characters engraven in the stone; and I walked through the morass of water-lilies, until I came close unto the shore, that I might read the characters upon the stone.|3|5|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
But I could not decypher them.|4|5|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And I was going back into the morass, when the moon shone with a fuller red, and I turned and looked again upon the rock, and upon the characters;--and the characters were DESOLATION.|5|5|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
"""And I looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of the rock; and I hid myself among the water-lilies that I might discover the actions of the man."|0|6|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And the man was tall and stately in form, and was wrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old Rome.|1|6|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And the outlines of his figure were indistinct--but his features were the features of a deity; for the mantle of the night, and of the mist, and of the moon, and of the dew, had left uncovered the features of his face.|2|6|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And his brow was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care; and, in the few furrows upon his cheek I read the fables of sorrow, and weariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude.|3|6|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
"""And the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his hand, and looked out upon the desolation."|0|7|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
He looked down into the low unquiet shrubbery, and up into the tall primeval trees, and up higher at the rustling heaven, and into the crimson moon.|1|7|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And I lay close within shelter of the lilies, and observed the actions of the man.|2|7|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And the man trembled in the solitude; --but the night waned, and he sat upon the rock.|3|7|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
"""And the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out upon the dreary river Zaire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters, and upon the pale legions of the water-lilies."|0|8|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And the man listened to the sighs of the water-lilies, and to the murmur that came up from among them.|1|8|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man.|2|8|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And the man trembled in the solitude; --but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.|3|8|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
"""Then I went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar in among the wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the hippopotami which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass."|0|9|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And the hippopotami heard my call, and came, with the behemoth, unto the foot of the rock, and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon.|1|9|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man.|2|9|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And the man trembled in the solitude; --but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.|3|9|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
"""Then I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult; and a frightful tempest gathered in the heaven where, before, there had been no wind."|0|10|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest --and the rain beat upon the head of the man --and the floods of the river came down --and the river was tormented into foam --and the water-lilies shrieked within their beds --and the forest crumbled before the wind --and the thunder rolled --and the lightning fell --and the rock rocked to its foundation.|1|10|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man.|2|10|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And the man trembled in the solitude; --but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.|3|10|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
"""Then I grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the river, and the lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and the heaven, and the thunder, and the sighs of the water-lilies."|0|11|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And they became accursed, and were still.|1|11|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to heaven --and the thunder died away --and the lightning did not flash --and the clouds hung motionless --and the waters sunk to their level and remained --and the trees ceased to rock --and the water-lilies sighed no more --and the murmur was heard no longer from among them, nor any shadow of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert.|2|11|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And I looked upon the characters of the rock, and they were changed; --and the characters were SILENCE.|3|11|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
"""And mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man, and his countenance was wan with terror."|0|12|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And, hurriedly, he raised his head from his hand, and stood forth upon the rock and listened.|1|12|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
But there was no voice throughout the vast illimitable desert, and the characters upon the rock were SILENCE.|2|12|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
"And the man shuddered, and turned his face away, and fled afar off, in haste, so that I beheld him no more""."|3|12|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
Now there are fine tales in the volumes of the Magi --in the iron-bound, melancholy volumes of the Magi.|0|13|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
Therein, I say, are glorious histories of the Heaven, and of the Earth, and of the mighty sea --and of the Genii that over-ruled the sea, and the earth, and the lofty heaven.|1|13|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
There was much lore too in the sayings which were said by the Sybils; and holy, holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around Dodona --but, as Allah liveth, that fable which the Demon told me as he sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb, I hold to be the most wonderful of all!|2|13|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And as the Demon made an end of his story, he fell back within the cavity of the tomb and laughed.|3|13|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And I could not laugh with the Demon, and he cursed me because I could not laugh.|4|13|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy
And the lynx which dwelleth forever in the tomb, came out therefrom, and lay down at the feet of the Demon, and looked at him steadily in the face.|5|13|Silence—A Fable|1838|Horror / Fantasy

Dr. Moneypenny says that S. stands for stale, and that D. U. K. spells duck, (but it don't,) that S. D. U.

At any rate we always add to our names the initials P. R. E. T. T. Y. B. L. U. E. B. A. T. C.

"There was no attention paid to that great point, the ""fitness of things""."|6|3|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody

And, after all, it's not so very difficult a matter to compose an article of the genuine Blackwood stamp, if one only goes properly about it.|4|4|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
Of course I don't speak of the political articles.|5|4|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
Everybody knows how they are managed, since Dr. Moneypenny explained it.|6|4|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
Mr. Blackwood has a pair of tailor's-shears, and three apprentices who stand by him for orders.|7|4|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
"One hands him the ""Times,"" another the ""Examiner"" and a third a ""Culley's New Compendium of Slang-Whang""."|8|4|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody

But the chief merit of the Magazine lies in its miscellaneous articles; and the best of these come under the head of what Dr. Moneypenny calls the bizarreries (whatever that may mean) and what everybody else calls the intensities.|0|5|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
This is a species of writing which I have long known how to appreciate, although it is only since my late visit to Mr. Blackwood (deputed by the society) that I have been made aware of the exact method of composition.|1|5|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
This method is very simple, but not so much so as the politics.|2|5|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
Upon my calling at Mr. B.'s, and making known to him the wishes of the society, he received me with great civility, took me into his study, and gave me a clear explanation of the whole process.|3|5|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody

He paused.|0|7|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
But, of course, as I had no wish to put an end to the conference, I assented to a proposition so very obvious, and one, too, of whose truth I had all along been sufficiently aware.|1|7|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
He seemed pleased, and went on with his instructions.|2|7|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody

There was 'The Dead Alive,' a capital thing!|2|8|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
–the record of a gentleman's sensations when entombed before the breath was out of his body–full of tastes, terror, sentiment, metaphysics, and erudition.|3|8|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
You would have sworn that the writer had been born and brought up in a coffin.|4|8|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
Then we had the 'Confessions of an Opium-eater'–fine, very fine!|5|8|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
–glorious imagination–deep philosophy acute speculation–plenty of fire and fury, and a good spicing of the decidedly unintelligible.|6|8|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody

"""The first thing requisite is to get yourself into such a scrape as no one ever got into before."|0|11|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
The oven, for instance,–that was a good hit.|1|11|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
But if you have no oven or big bell, at hand, and if you cannot conveniently tumble out of a balloon, or be swallowed up in an earthquake, or get stuck fast in a chimney, you will have to be contented with simply imagining some similar misadventure.|2|11|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
I should prefer, however, that you have the actual fact to bear you out.|3|11|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody

Take a dose of Brandreth's pills, and then give us your sensations.|3|13|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
However, my instructions will apply equally well to any variety of misadventure, and in your way home you may easily get knocked in the head, or run over by an omnibus, or bitten by a mad dog, or drowned in a gutter.|4|13|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
But to proceed.|5|13|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
"""Having determined upon your subject, you must next consider the tone, or manner, of your narration."|0|14|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
There is the tone didactic, the tone enthusiastic, the tone natural–all common–place enough.|1|14|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
But then there is the tone laconic, or curt, which has lately come much into use.|2|14|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
It consists in short sentences.|3|14|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
Somehow thus: Can't be too brief.|4|14|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
Can't be too snappish.|5|14|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody

"""Then there is the tone elevated, diffusive, and interjectional."|0|15|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody
Some of our best novelists patronize this tone.|1|15|How To Write A Blackwood Article|November 1838|Parody

–it was there–that is to say, it was somewhere.|14|6|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Diana smelled the rat.|15|6|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I–I could not!|16|6|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Thus it is said the Prussian Isis has, for some persons, a sweet and very powerful perfume, while to others it is perfectly scentless.|17|6|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
The staircase had been surmounted, and there were now only three or four more upward steps intervening between us and the summit.|0|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
We still ascended, and now only one step remained.|1|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
One step!|2|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
One little, little step!|3|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Upon one such little step in the great staircase of human life how vast a sum of human happiness or misery depends!|4|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I thought of myself, then of Pompey, and then of the mysterious and inexplicable destiny which surrounded us.|5|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I thought of Pompey!|6|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
–alas, I thought of love!|7|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I thought of my many false steps which have been taken, and may be taken again.|8|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I resolved to be more cautious, more reserved.|9|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I abandoned the arm of Pompey, and, without his assistance, surmounted the one remaining step, and gained the chamber of the belfry.|10|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I was followed immediately afterward by my poodle.|11|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Pompey alone remained behind.|12|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I stood at the head of the staircase, and encouraged him to ascend.|13|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
He stretched forth to me his hand, and unfortunately in so doing was forced to abandon his firm hold upon the overcoat.|14|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Will the gods never cease their persecution?|15|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
The overcoat is dropped, and, with one of his feet, Pompey stepped upon the long and trailing skirt of the overcoat.|16|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
He stumbled and fell–this consequence was inevitable.|17|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
He fell forward, and, with his accursed head, striking me full in the–in the breast, precipitated me headlong, together with himself, upon the hard, filthy, and detestable floor of the belfry.|18|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
But my revenge was sure, sudden, and complete.|19|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Seizing him furiously by the wool with both hands, I tore out a vast quantity of black, and crisp, and curling material, and tossed it from me with every manifestation of disdain.|20|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
It fell among the ropes of the belfry and remained.|21|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Pompey arose, and said no word.|22|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
But he regarded me piteously with his large eyes and–sighed.|23|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Ye Gods–that sigh!|24|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
It sunk into my heart.|25|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
And the hair–the wool!|26|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Could I have reached that wool I would have bathed it with my tears, in testimony of regret.|27|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
But alas!|28|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
it was now far beyond my grasp.|29|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
As it dangled among the cordage of the bell, I fancied it alive.|30|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I fancied that it stood on end with indignation.|31|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Thus the happy-dandy Flos Aeris of Java bears, it is said, a beautiful flower, which will live when pulled up by the roots.|32|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
The natives suspend it by a cord from the ceiling and enjoy its fragrance for years.|33|7|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Our quarrel was now made up, and we looked about the room for an aperture through which to survey the city of Edina.|0|8|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Windows there were none.|1|8|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
The sole light admitted into the gloomy chamber proceeded from a square opening, about a foot in diameter, at a height of about seven feet from the floor.|2|8|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Yet what will the energy of true genius not effect?|3|8|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I resolved to clamber up to this hole.|4|8|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
A vast quantity of wheels, pinions, and other cabalistic–looking machinery stood opposite the hole, close to it; and through the hole there passed an iron rod from the machinery.|5|8|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Between the wheels and the wall where the hole lay there was barely room for my body–yet I was desperate, and determined to persevere.|6|8|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I called Pompey to my side.|7|8|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
"""You perceive that aperture, Pompey."|0|9|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I wish to look through it.|1|9|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
You will stand here just beneath the hole–so.|2|9|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Now, hold out one of your hands, Pompey, and let me step upon it–thus.|3|9|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
"Now, the other hand, Pompey, and with its aid I will get upon your shoulders""."|4|9|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
He did every thing I wished, and I found, upon getting up, that I could easily pass my head and neck through the aperture.|0|10|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
The prospect was sublime.|1|10|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Nothing could be more magnificent.|2|10|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I merely paused a moment to bid Diana behave herself, and assure Pompey that I would be considerate and bear as lightly as possible upon his shoulders.|3|10|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I told him I would be tender of his feelings–ossi tender que beefsteak.|4|10|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Having done this justice to my faithful friend, I gave myself up with great zest and enthusiasm to the enjoyment of the scene which so obligingly spread itself out before my eyes.|5|10|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Upon this subject, however, I shall forbear to dilate.|0|11|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I will not describe the city of Edinburgh.|1|11|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Every one has been to the city of Edinburgh.|2|11|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Every one has been to Edinburgh–the classic Edina.|3|11|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I will confine myself to the momentous details of my own lamentable adventure.|4|11|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Having, in some measure, satisfied my curiosity in regard to the extent, situation, and general appearance of the city, I had leisure to survey the church in which I was, and the delicate architecture of the steeple.|5|11|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I observed that the aperture through which I had thrust my head was an opening in the dial-plate of a gigantic clock, and must have appeared, from the street, as a large key-hole, such as we see in the face of the French watches.|6|11|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
No doubt the true object was to admit the arm of an attendant, to adjust, when necessary, the hands of the clock from within.|7|11|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I observed also, with surprise, the immense size of these hands, the longest of which could not have been less than ten feet in length, and, where broadest, eight or nine inches in breadth.|8|11|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
They were of solid steel apparently, and their edges appeared to be sharp.|9|11|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Having noticed these particulars, and some others, I again turned my eyes upon the glorious prospect below, and soon became absorbed in contemplation.|10|11|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
From this, after some minutes, I was aroused by the voice of Pompey, who declared that he could stand it no longer, and requested that I would be so kind as to come down.|0|12|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
This was unreasonable, and I told him so in a speech of some length.|1|12|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
He replied, but with an evident misunderstanding of my ideas upon the subject.|2|12|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I accordingly grew angry, and told him in plain words, that he was a fool, that he had committed an ignoramus e-clench-eye, that his notions were mere insommary Bovis, and his words little better than an ennemywerrybor'em.|3|12|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
With this he appeared satisfied, and I resumed my contemplations.|4|12|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
It might have been half an hour after this altercation when, as I was deeply absorbed in the heavenly scenery beneath me, I was startled by something very cold which pressed with a gentle pressure on the back of my neck.|0|13|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
It is needless to say that I felt inexpressibly alarmed.|1|13|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I knew that Pompey was beneath my feet, and that Diana was sitting, according to my explicit directions, upon her hind legs, in the farthest corner of the room.|2|13|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
What could it be?|3|13|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Alas!|4|13|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I but too soon discovered.|5|13|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Turning my head gently to one side, I perceived, to my extreme horror, that the huge, glittering, scimetar-like minute-hand of the clock had, in the course of its hourly revolution, descended upon my neck.|6|13|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
There was, I knew, not a second to be lost.|7|13|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I pulled back at once–but it was too late.|8|13|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
There was no chance of forcing my head through the mouth of that terrible trap in which it was so fairly caught, and which grew narrower and narrower with a rapidity too horrible to be conceived.|9|13|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
The agony of that moment is not to be imagined.|10|13|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I threw up my hands and endeavored, with all my strength, to force upward the ponderous iron bar.|11|13|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I might as well have tried to lift the cathedral itself.|12|13|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Down, down, down it came, closer and yet closer.|13|13|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I screamed to Pompey for aid; but he said that I had hurt his feelings by calling him 'an ignorant old squint-eye:' I yelled to Diana; but she only said 'bow-wow-wow,' and that I had told her 'on no account to stir from the corner.|14|13|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
' Thus I had no relief to expect from my associates.|15|13|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Meantime the ponderous and terrific Scythe of Time (for I now discovered the literal import of that classical phrase) had not stopped, nor was it likely to stop, in its career.|0|14|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Down and still down, it came.|1|14|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
It had already buried its sharp edge a full inch in my flesh, and my sensations grew indistinct and confused.|2|14|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
At one time I fancied myself in Philadelphia with the stately Dr. Moneypenny, at another in the back parlor of Mr. Blackwood receiving his invaluable instructions.|3|14|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
And then again the sweet recollection of better and earlier times came over me, and I thought of that happy period when the world was not all a desert, and Pompey not altogether cruel.|4|14|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
The ticking of the machinery amused me.|0|15|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Amused me, I say, for my sensations now bordered upon perfect happiness, and the most trifling circumstances afforded me pleasure.|1|15|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
The eternal click-clak, click-clak, click-clak of the clock was the most melodious of music in my ears, and occasionally even put me in mind of the graceful sermonic harangues of Dr. Ollapod.|2|15|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Then there were the great figures upon the dial-plate–how intelligent how intellectual, they all looked!|3|15|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
And presently they took to dancing the Mazurka, and I think it was the figure V. who performed the most to my satisfaction.|4|15|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
She was evidently a lady of breeding.|5|15|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
None of your swaggerers, and nothing at all indelicate in her motions.|6|15|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
She did the pirouette to admiration- whirling round upon her apex.|7|15|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I made an endeavor to hand her a chair, for I saw that she appeared fatigued with her exertions–and it was not until then that I fully perceived my lamentable situation.|8|15|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Lamentable indeed!|9|15|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
The bar had buried itself two inches in my neck.|10|15|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I was aroused to a sense of exquisite pain.|11|15|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Nommy, torny, darry, widdy!|0|19|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
But now a new horror presented itself, and one indeed sufficient to startle the strongest nerves.|0|20|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
My eyes, from the cruel pressure of the machine, were absolutely starting from their sockets.|1|20|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
While I was thinking how I should possibly manage without them, one actually tumbled out of my head, and, rolling down the steep side of the steeple, lodged in the rain gutter which ran along the eaves of the main building.|2|20|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
The loss of the eye was not so much as the insolent air of independence and contempt with which it regarded me after it was out.|3|20|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
There it lay in the gutter just under my nose, and the airs it gave itself would have been ridiculous had they not been disgusting.|4|20|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Such a winking and blinking were never before seen.|5|20|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
This behavior on the part of my eye in the gutter was not only irritating on account of its manifest insolence and shameful ingratitude, but was also exceedingly inconvenient on account of the sympathy which always exists between two eyes of the same head, however far apart.|6|20|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I was forced, in a manner, to wink and to blink, whether I would or not, in exact concert with the scoundrelly thing that lay just under my nose.|7|20|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I was presently relieved, however, by the dropping out of the other eye.|8|20|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
In falling it took the same direction (possibly a concerted plot) as its fellow.|9|20|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Both rolled out of the gutter together, and in truth I was very glad to get rid of them.|10|20|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
The bar was now four inches and a half deep in my neck, and there was only a little bit of skin to cut through.|0|21|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
My sensations were those of entire happiness, for I felt that in a few minutes, at farthest, I should be relieved from my disagreeable situation.|1|21|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
And in this expectation I was not at all deceived.|2|21|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
At twenty-five minutes past five in the afternoon, precisely, the huge minute-hand had proceeded sufficiently far on its terrible revolution to sever the small remainder of my neck.|3|21|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I was not sorry to see the head which had occasioned me so much embarrassment at length make a final separation from my body.|4|21|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
It first rolled down the side of the steeple, then lodge, for a few seconds, in the gutter, and then made its way, with a plunge, into the middle of the street.|5|21|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I will candidly confess that my feelings were now of the most singular–nay, of the most mysterious, the most perplexing and incomprehensible character.|0|22|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
My senses were here and there at one and the same moment.|1|22|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
With my head I imagined, at one time, that I, the head, was the real Signora Psyche Zenobia–at another I felt convinced that myself, the body, was the proper identity.|2|22|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
To clear my ideas on this topic I felt in my pocket for my snuff-box, but, upon getting it, and endeavoring to apply a pinch of its grateful contents in the ordinary manner, I became immediately aware of my peculiar deficiency, and threw the box at once down to my head.|3|22|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
It took a pinch with great satisfaction, and smiled me an acknowledgement in return.|4|22|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Shortly afterward it made me a speech, which I could hear but indistinctly without ears.|5|22|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I gathered enough, however, to know that it was astonished at my wishing to remain alive under such circumstances.|6|22|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
thus comparing me to the hero who, in the heat of the combat, not perceiving that he was dead, continued to contest the battle with inextinguishable valor.|0|25|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
There was nothing now to prevent my getting down from my elevation, and I did so.|1|25|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
What it was that Pompey saw so very peculiar in my appearance I have never yet been able to find out.|2|25|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
The fellow opened his mouth from ear to ear, and shut his two eyes as if he were endeavoring to crack nuts between the lids.|3|25|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Finally, throwing off his overcoat, he made one spring for the staircase and disappeared.|4|25|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
and then turned to the darling of my heart, to the one-eyed!|0|27|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
the shaggy-haired Diana.|1|27|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Alas!|2|27|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
what a horrible vision affronted my eyes?|3|27|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Was that a rat I saw skulking into his hole?|4|27|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Are these the picked bones of the little angel who has been cruelly devoured by the monster?|5|27|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Ye gods!|6|27|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
and what do I behold–is that the departed spirit, the shade, the ghost, of my beloved puppy, which I perceive sitting with a grace so melancholy, in the corner?|7|27|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Hearken!|8|27|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
for she speaks, and, heavens!|9|27|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Duk she!|0|29|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
"duk she""!"|1|29|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Alas!|0|30|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
and are not her words too true?|1|30|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
"For thee–for thee""."|0|32|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Sweet creature!|0|33|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
she too has sacrificed herself in my behalf.|1|33|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Dogless, niggerless, headless, what now remains for the unhappy Signora Psyche Zenobia?|2|33|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
Alas–nothing!|3|33|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody
I have done.|4|33|A Predicament|November 1838|Parody

Some one did introduce me to the gentleman, I am sure–at some public meeting, I know very well–held about something of great importance, no doubt–at some place or other, I feel convinced, whose name I have unaccountably forgotten.|1|1|The Man That Was Used Up|August 1839|Satire
The truth is–that the introduction was attended, upon my part, with a degree of anxious embarrassment which operated to prevent any definite impressions of either time or place.|2|1|The Man That Was Used Up|August 1839|Satire

His head of hair would have done honor to a Brutus,–nothing could be more richly flowing, or possess a brighter gloss.|4|2|The Man That Was Used Up|August 1839|Satire
It was of a jetty black,–which was also the color, or more properly the no-color of his unimaginable whiskers.|5|2|The Man That Was Used Up|August 1839|Satire
You perceive I cannot speak of these latter without enthusiasm; it is not too much to say that they were the handsomest pair of whiskers under the sun.|6|2|The Man That Was Used Up|August 1839|Satire

But although men so absolutely fine-looking are neither as plenty as reasons or blackberries, still I could not bring myself to believe that the remarkable something to which I alluded just now,–that the odd air of je ne sais quoi which hung about my new acquaintance,- lay altogether, or indeed at all, in the supreme excellence of his bodily endowments.|0|4|The Man That Was Used Up|August 1839|Satire
Perhaps it might be traced to the manner,–yet here again I could not pretend to be positive.|1|4|The Man That Was Used Up|August 1839|Satire
There was a primness, not to say stiffness, in his carriage–a degree of measured and, if I may so express it, of rectangular precision attending his every movement, which, observed in a more diminutive figure, would have had the least little savor in the world of affectation, pomposity, or constraint, but which, noticed in a gentleman of his undoubted dimensions, was readily placed to the account of reserve, hauteur- of a commendable sense, in short, of what is due to the dignity of colossal proportion.|2|4|The Man That Was Used Up|August 1839|Satire

With becoming modesty, he forebore, nevertheless, to touch upon the theme I had just then most at heart–I mean the mysterious circumstances attending the Bugaboo war–and, on my own part, what I conceive to be a proper sense of delicacy forbade me to broach the subject; although, in truth, I was exceedingly tempted to do so.|3|9|The Man That Was Used Up|August 1839|Satire

Thompson, to be sure, is not my name; but it is needless to say that I left General Smith with a heightened interest in the man, with an exalted opinion of his conversational powers, and a deep sense of the valuable privileges we enjoy in living in this age of mechanical invention.|0|11|The Man That Was Used Up|August 1839|Satire

DURING the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher.|0|1|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
I know not how it was --but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit.|1|1|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror

I looked upon the scene before me --upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain --upon the bleak walls --upon the vacant eye-like windows --upon a few rank sedges --and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees --with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium --the bitter lapse into everyday life-the hideous dropping off of the reveller upon opium --the bitter lapse into everyday life --the hideous dropping off of the veil.|3|1|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror

It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down --but with a shudder even more thrilling than before --upon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant and eye-like windows.|8|1|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror

I was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties, of musical science.|2|3|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honoured as it was, had put forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain.|3|3|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
"It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people, and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other --it was this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the ""House of Usher"" --an appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family and the family mansion."|4|3|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror

I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity-an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the gray wall, and the silent tarn --a pestilent and mystic vapour, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.|5|4|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror

While the objects around me --while the carvings of the ceilings, the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of the floors, and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as I strode, were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had been accustomed from my infancy --while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this --I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up.|4|6|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror

Yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable.|5|8|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
A cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten.|6|8|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror

His action was alternately vivacious and sullen.|2|9|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) to that species of energetic concision --that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation --that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his most intense excitement.|3|9|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror

He suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odours of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did not inspire him with horror.|5|10|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror

I learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and equivocal hints, another singular feature of his mental condition.|0|12|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
He was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never ventured forth --in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be re-stated --an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion, had, by dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit-an effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets, and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about upon the morale of his existence.|1|12|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable origin --to the severe and long-continued illness --indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution-of a tenderly beloved sister --his sole companion for long years --his last and only relative on earth.|0|13|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
"""Her decease,"" he said, with a bitterness which I can never forget, ""would leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last of the ancient race of the Ushers""."|1|13|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror

A sensation of stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps.|4|13|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
When a door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother --but he had buried his face in his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears.|5|13|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
The disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians.|0|14|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person, and frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical character, were the unusual diagnosis.|1|14|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself finally to bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house, she succumbed (as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating power of the destroyer; and I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last I should obtain --that the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me no more.|2|14|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or myself: and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavours to alleviate the melancholy of my friend.|0|15|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror

From the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not why; --from these paintings (vivid as their images now are before me) I would in vain endeavour to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words.|5|16|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror

) In state his glory well befitting, The ruler of the realm was seen.|1|24|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
IV.|0|25|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
And all with pearl and ruby glowing Was the fair palace door, Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing And sparkling evermore, A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty Was but to sing, In voices of surpassing beauty, The wit and wisdom of their king.|0|26|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
But evil things, in robes of sorrow, Assailed the monarch's high estate; (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow Shall dawn upon him, desolate!|0|28|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
) And, round about his home, the glory That blushed and bloomed Is but a dim-remembered story Of the old time entombed.|1|28|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
VI.|0|29|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
And travellers now within that valley, Through the red-litten windows, see Vast forms that move fantastically To a discordant melody; While, like a rapid ghastly river, Through the pale door, A hideous throng rush out forever, And laugh --but smile no more.|0|30|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of Usher's which I mention not so much on account of its novelty, (for other men have thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it.|0|31|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
This opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things.|1|31|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization.|2|31|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
I lack words to express the full extent, or the earnest abandon of his persuasion.|3|31|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
The belief, however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers.|4|31|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
The conditions of the sentience had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stones --in the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them, and of the decayed trees which stood around --above all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn.|5|31|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Its evidence --the evidence of the sentience --was to be seen, he said, (and I here started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls.|6|31|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
The result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family, and which made him what I now saw him --what he was.|7|31|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Such opinions need no comment, and I will make none.|8|31|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Our books --the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalid --were, as might be supposed, in strict keeping with this character of phantasm.|0|32|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
We pored together over such works as the Ververt et Chartreuse of Gresset; the Belphegor of Machiavelli; the Heaven and Hell of Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage of Nicholas Klimm by Holberg; the Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean D'Indagine, and of De la Chambre; the Journey into the Blue Distance of Tieck; and the City of the Sun of Campanella.|1|32|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
One favourite volume was a small octavo edition of the Directorium Inquisitorum, by the Dominican Eymeric de Gironne; and there were passages in Pomponius Mela, about the old African Satyrs and AEgipans, over which Usher would sit dreaming for hours.|2|32|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
His chief delight, however, was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto Gothic --the manual of a forgotten church --the Vigilae Mortuorum secundum Chorum Ecclesiae Maguntinae.|3|32|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening, having informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more, he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight, (previously to its final interment,) in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building.|0|33|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
The worldly reason, however, assigned for this singular proceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute.|1|33|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
The brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased, of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of the remote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family.|2|33|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
I will not deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom I met upon the stair case, on the day of my arrival at the house, I had no desire to oppose what I regarded as at best but a harmless, and by no means an unnatural, precaution.|3|33|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
At the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment.|0|34|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
The body having been encoffined, we two alone bore it to its rest.|1|34|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
The vault in which we placed it (and which had been so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation) was small, damp, and entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment.|2|34|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
It had been used, apparently, in remote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and, in later days, as a place of deposit for powder, or some other highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor, and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it, were carefully sheathed with copper.|3|34|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
The door, of massive iron, had been, also, similarly protected.|4|34|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges.|5|34|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant.|0|35|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
A striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and Usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from which I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them.|1|35|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead --for we could not regard her unawed.|2|35|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death.|3|35|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door of iron, made our way, with toll, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house.|4|35|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend.|0|36|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
His ordinary manner had vanished.|1|36|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
His ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten.|2|36|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless step.|3|36|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly hue --but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out.|4|36|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized his utterance.|5|36|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
There were times, indeed, when I thought his unceasingly agitated mind was labouring with some oppressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage.|6|36|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
At times, again, I was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for I beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the profoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound.|7|36|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
It was no wonder that his condition terrified-that it infected me.|8|36|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions.|9|36|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
It was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within the donjon, that I experienced the full power of such feelings.|0|37|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Sleep came not near my couch --while the hours waned and waned away.|1|37|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
I struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me.|2|37|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
I endeavoured to believe that much, if not all of what I felt, was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the room --of the dark and tattered draperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed.|3|37|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
But my efforts were fruitless.|4|37|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
An irrepressible tremour gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length, there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm.|5|37|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber, hearkened --I know not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted me --to certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence.|6|37|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw on my clothes with haste (for I felt that I should sleep no more during the night), and endeavoured to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which I had fAllan, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment.|7|37|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention.|0|38|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
I presently recognised it as that of Usher.|1|38|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
In an instant afterward he rapped, with a gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp.|2|38|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
His countenance was, as usual, cadaverously wan --but, moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes --an evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanour.|3|38|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
His air appalled me --but anything was preferable to the solitude which I had so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence as a relief.|4|38|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
"""And you have not seen it""?"|0|39|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
"he said abruptly, after having stared about him for some moments in silence --""you have not then seen it?"|1|39|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
--but, stay!|2|39|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
"you shall""."|3|39|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open to the storm.|4|39|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
The impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet.|0|40|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty.|1|40|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
A whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity; for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind; and the exceeding density of the clouds (which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house) did not prevent our perceiving the life-like velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other, without passing away into the distance.|2|40|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
I say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this --yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars --nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning.|3|40|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
But the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapour, as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion.|4|40|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
"""You must not --you shall not behold this""!"|0|41|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
said I, shudderingly, to Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence, from the window to a seat.|1|41|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
"""These appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon --or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn."|2|41|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Let us close this casement; --the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame.|3|41|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Here is one of your favourite romances.|4|41|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
"I will read, and you shall listen; --and so we will pass away this terrible night together""."|5|41|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
"The antique volume which I had taken up was the ""Mad Trist"" of Sir Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favourite of Usher's more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend."|0|42|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
It was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of the folly which I should read.|1|42|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Could I have judged, indeed, by the wild over-strained air of vivacity with which he hearkened, or apparently hearkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design.|2|42|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred, the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance by force.|0|43|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
"""And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who, in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling there-with sturdily, he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood alarumed and reverberated throughout the forest."|0|44|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
At the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment, paused; for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me) --it appeared to me that, from some very remote portion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly, to my ears, what might have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which Sir Launcelot had so particularly described.|0|45|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
It was, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested or disturbed me.|1|45|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
"And Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it, the like whereof was never before heard""."|0|49|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Here again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild amazement --for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this instance, I did actually hear (although from what direction it proceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant, but harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating sound --the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon's unnatural shriek as described by the romancer.|0|50|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of the second and most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the sensitive nervousness of my companion.|0|51|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
I was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanour.|1|51|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber; and thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly.|2|51|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
His head had dropped upon his breast --yet I knew that he was not asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in profile.|3|51|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
The motion of his body, too, was at variance with this idea --for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway.|4|51|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
"""And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out of the way before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which in sooth tarried not for his full coming, but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor, with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound""."|0|52|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than --as if a shield of brass had indeed, at the moment, fAllan heavily upon a floor of silver became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and clangorous, yet apparently muffled reverberation.|0|53|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Completely unnerved, I leaped to my feet; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed.|1|53|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
I rushed to the chair in which he sat.|2|53|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity.|3|53|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
But, as I placed my hand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and I saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if unconscious of my presence.|4|53|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Bending closely over him, I at length drank in the hideous import of his words.|5|53|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
"""Not hear it?"|0|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
--yes, I hear it, and have heard it.|1|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Long --long --long --many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard it --yet I dared not --oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am!|2|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
--I dared not --I dared not speak!|3|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
We have put her living in the tomb!|4|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Said I not that my senses were acute?|5|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
I now tell you that I heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin.|6|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
I heard them --many, many days ago --yet I dared not --I dared not speak!|7|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
And now --to-night --Ethelred --ha!|8|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
ha!|9|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
--the breaking of the hermit's door, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangour of the shield!|10|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
--say, rather, the rending of her coffin, and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison, and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault!|11|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Oh whither shall I fly?|12|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Will she not be here anon?|13|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste?|14|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Have I not heard her footstep on the stair?|15|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart?|16|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
"MADMAN""!"|17|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
"here he sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out his syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up his soul --""MADMAN!"|18|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
"I TELL YOU THAT SHE NOW STANDS WITHOUT THE DOOR""!"|19|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spell --the huge antique panels to which the speaker pointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant, ponderous and ebony jaws.|0|55|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
It was the work of the rushing gust --but then without those doors there DID stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline of Usher.|1|55|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
There was blood upon her white robes, and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame.|2|55|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
For a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold, then, with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother, and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to the floor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated.|3|55|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
From that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast.|0|56|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
The storm was still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old causeway.|1|56|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could wi have issued; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me.|2|56|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
The radiance was that of the full, setting, and blood-red moon which now shone vividly through that once barely-discernible fissure of which I have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building, in a zigzag direction, to the base.|3|56|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror
"While I gazed, this fissure rapidly widened --there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind --the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight --my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder --there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters --and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the ""HOUSE OF USHER""."|4|56|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|September 1839|Horror

I would wish them to seek out for me, in the details I am about to give, some little oasis of fatality amid a wilderness of error.|17|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I would have them allow --what they cannot refrain from allowing --that, although temptation may have erewhile existed as great, man was never thus, at least, tempted before --certainly, never thus fell.|18|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
And is it therefore that he has never thus suffered?|19|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Have I not indeed been living in a dream?|20|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
And am I not now dying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest of all sublunary visions?|21|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily excitable temperament has at all times rendered them remarkable; and, in my earliest infancy, I gave evidence of having fully inherited the family character.|22|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
As I advanced in years it was more strongly developed; becoming, for many reasons, a cause of serious disquietude to my friends, and of positive injury to myself.|23|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I grew self-willed, addicted to the wildest caprices, and a prey to the most ungovernable passions.|24|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Weak-minded, and beset with constitutional infirmities akin to my own, my parents could do but little to check the evil propensities which distinguished me.|25|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Some feeble and ill-directed efforts resulted in complete failure on their part, and, of course, in total triumph on mine.|26|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Thenceforward my voice was a household law; and at an age when few children have abandoned their leading-strings, I was left to the guidance of my own will, and became, in all but name, the master of my own actions.|27|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
My earliest recollections of a school-life, are connected with a large, rambling, Elizabethan house, in a misty-looking village of England, where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees, and where all the houses were excessively ancient.|28|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
In truth, it was a dream-like and spirit-soothing place, that venerable old town.|29|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
At this moment, in fancy, I feel the refreshing chilliness of its deeply-shadowed avenues, inhale the fragrance of its thousand shrubberies, and thrill anew with undefinable delight, at the deep hollow note of the church-bell, breaking, each hour, with sullen and sudden roar, upon the stillness of the dusky atmosphere in which the fretted Gothic steeple lay imbedded and asleep.|30|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
It gives me, perhaps, as much of pleasure as I can now in any manner experience, to dwell upon minute recollections of the school and its concerns.|31|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Steeped in misery as I am --misery, alas!|32|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
only too real --I shall be pardoned for seeking relief, however slight and temporary, in the weakness of a few rambling details.|33|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
These, moreover, utterly trivial, and even ridiculous in themselves, assume, to my fancy, adventitious importance, as connected with a period and a locality when and where I recognise the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which afterwards so fully overshadowed me.|34|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Let me then remember.|35|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The house, I have said, was old and irregular.|36|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The grounds were extensive, and a high and solid brick wall, topped with a bed of mortar and broken glass, encompassed the whole.|37|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
This prison-like rampart formed the limit of our domain; beyond it we saw but thrice a week --once every Saturday afternoon, when, attended by two ushers, we were permitted to take brief walks in a body through some of the neighbouring fields --and twice during Sunday, when we were paraded in the same formal manner to the morning and evening service in the one church of the village.|38|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Of this church the principal of our school was pastor.|39|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
With how deep a spirit of wonder and perplexity was I wont to regard him from our remote pew in the gallery, as, with step solemn and slow, he ascended the pulpit!|40|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
This reverend man, with countenance so demurely benign, with robes so glossy and so clerically flowing, with wig so minutely powdered, so rigid and so vast, ---could this be he who, of late, with sour visage, and in snuffy habiliments, administered, ferule in hand, the Draconian laws of the academy?|41|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Oh, gigantic paradox, too utterly monstrous for solution!|42|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
At an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate.|43|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
It was riveted and studded with iron bolts, and surmounted with jagged iron spikes.|44|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
What impressions of deep awe did it inspire!|45|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
It was never opened save for the three periodical egressions and ingressions already mentioned; then, in every creak of its mighty hinges, we found a plenitude of mystery --a world of matter for solemn remark, or for more solemn meditation.|46|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The extensive enclosure was irregular in form, having many capacious recesses.|47|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Of these, three or four of the largest constituted the play-ground.|48|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
It was level, and covered with fine hard gravel.|49|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I well remember it had no trees, nor benches, nor anything similar within it.|50|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Of course it was in the rear of the house.|51|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
In front lay a small parterre, planted with box and other shrubs; but through this sacred division we passed only upon rare occasions indeed --such as a first advent to school or final departure thence, or perhaps, when a parent or friend having called for us, we joyfully took our way home for the Christmas or Midsummer holy-days.|52|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
But the house!|53|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
--how quaint an old building was this!|54|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
--to me how veritably a palace of enchantment!|55|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
There was really no end to its windings --to its incomprehensible subdivisions.|56|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
It was difficult, at any given time, to say with certainty upon which of its two stories one happened to be.|57|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
From each room to every other there were sure to be found three or four steps either in ascent or descent.|58|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Then the lateral branches were innumerable --inconceivable --and so returning in upon themselves, that our most exact ideas in regard to the whole mansion were not very far different from those with which we pondered upon infinity.|59|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
During the five years of my residence here, I was never able to ascertain with precision, in what remote locality lay the little sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or twenty other scholars.|60|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The school-room was the largest in the house --I could not help thinking, in the world.|61|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
It was very long, narrow, and dismally low, with pointed Gothic windows and a celling of oak.|62|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
"In a remote and terror-inspiring angle was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet, comprising the sanctum, ""during hours,"" of our principal, the Reverend Dr. Bransby."|63|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
"It was a solid structure, with massy door, sooner than open which in the absence of the ""Dominic,"" we would all have willingly perished by the peine forte et dure."|64|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
In other angles were two other similar boxes, far less reverenced, indeed, but still greatly matters of awe.|65|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
"One of these was the pulpit of the ""classical"" usher, one of the ""English and mathematical""."|66|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Interspersed about the room, crossing and recrossing in endless irregularity, were innumerable benches and desks, black, ancient, and time-worn, piled desperately with much-bethumbed books, and so beseamed with initial letters, names at full length, grotesque figures, and other multiplied efforts of the knife, as to have entirely lost what little of original form might have been their portion in days long departed.|67|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
A huge bucket with water stood at one extremity of the room, and a clock of stupendous dimensions at the other.|68|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy, I passed, yet not in tedium or disgust, the years of the third lustrum of my life.|69|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident to occupy or amuse it; and the apparently dismal monotony of a school was replete with more intense excitement than my riper youth has derived from luxury, or my full manhood from crime.|70|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Yet I must believe that my first mental development had in it much of the uncommon --even much of the outre.|71|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Upon mankind at large the events of very early existence rarely leave in mature age any definite impression.|72|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
All is gray shadow --a weak and irregular remembrance --an indistinct regathering of feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains.|73|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
With me this is not so.|74|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
In childhood I must have felt with the energy of a man what I now find stamped upon memory in lines as vivid, as deep, and as durable as the exergues of the Carthaginian medals.|75|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Yet in fact --in the fact of the world's view --how little was there to remember!|76|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The morning's awakening, the nightly summons to bed; the connings, the recitations; the periodical half-holidays, and perambulations; the play-ground, with its broils, its pastimes, its intrigues; --these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made to involve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, an universe of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and spirit-stirring.|77|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
"""Oh, le bon temps, que ce siecle de fer""!"|78|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
In truth, the ardor, the enthusiasm, and the imperiousness of my disposition, soon rendered me a marked character among my schoolmates, and by slow, but natural gradations, gave me an ascendancy over all not greatly older than myself; --over all with a single exception.|79|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
This exception was found in the person of a scholar, who, although no relation, bore the same Christian and surname as myself; --a circumstance, in fact, little remarkable; for, notwithstanding a noble descent, mine was one of those everyday appellations which seem, by prescriptive right, to have been, time out of mind, the common property of the mob.|80|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
In this narrative I have therefore designated myself as William Wilson, --a fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real.|81|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
"My namesake alone, of those who in school phraseology constituted ""our set,"" presumed to compete with me in the studies of the class --in the sports and broils of the play-ground --to refuse implicit belief in my assertions, and submission to my will --indeed, to interfere with my arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever."|82|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
If there is on earth a supreme and unqualified despotism, it is the despotism of a master mind in boyhood over the less energetic spirits of its companions.|83|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Wilson's rebellion was to me a source of the greatest embarrassment; --the more so as, in spite of the bravado with which in public I made a point of treating him and his pretensions, I secretly felt that I feared him, and could not help thinking the equality which he maintained so easily with myself, a proof of his true superiority; since not to be overcome cost me a perpetual struggle.|84|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Yet this superiority --even this equality --was in truth acknowledged by no one but myself; our associates, by some unaccountable blindness, seemed not even to suspect it.|85|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Indeed, his competition, his resistance, and especially his impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes, were not more pointed than private.|86|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
He appeared to be destitute alike of the ambition which urged, and of the passionate energy of mind which enabled me to excel.|87|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
In his rivalry he might have been supposed actuated solely by a whimsical desire to thwart, astonish, or mortify myself; although there were times when I could not help observing, with a feeling made up of wonder, abasement, and pique, that he mingled with his injuries, his insults, or his contradictions, a certain most inappropriate, and assuredly most unwelcome affectionateness of manner.|88|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I could only conceive this singular behavior to arise from a consummate self-conceit assuming the vulgar airs of patronage and protection.|89|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Perhaps it was this latter trait in Wilson's conduct, conjoined with our identity of name, and the mere accident of our having entered the school upon the same day, which set afloat the notion that we were brothers, among the senior classes in the academy.|90|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
These do not usually inquire with much strictness into the affairs of their juniors.|91|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I have before said, or should have said, that Wilson was not, in the most remote degree, connected with my family.|92|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
But assuredly if we had been brothers we must have been twins; for, after leaving Dr. Bransby's, I casually learned that my namesake was born on the nineteenth of January, 1813 --and this is a somewhat remarkable coincidence; for the day is precisely that of my own nativity.|93|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
It may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned me by the rivalry of Wilson, and his intolerable spirit of contradiction, I could not bring myself to hate him altogether.|94|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
"We had, to be sure, nearly every day a quarrel in which, yielding me publicly the palm of victory, he, in some manner, contrived to make me feel that it was he who had deserved it; yet a sense of pride on my part, and a veritable dignity on his own, kept us always upon what are called ""speaking terms,"" while there were many points of strong congeniality in our tempers, operating to awake me in a sentiment which our position alone, perhaps, prevented from ripening into friendship."|95|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
It is difficult, indeed, to define,or even to describe, my real feelings towards him.|96|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
They formed a motley and heterogeneous admixture; --some petulant animosity, which was not yet hatred, some esteem, more respect, much fear, with a world of uneasy curiosity.|97|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
To the moralist it will be unnecessary to say, in addition, that Wilson and myself were the most inseparable of companions.|98|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
It was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between us, which turned all my attacks upon him, (and they were many, either open or covert) into the channel of banter or practical joke (giving pain while assuming the aspect of mere fun) rather than into a more serious and determined hostility.|99|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
But my endeavours on this head were by no means uniformly successful, even when my plans were the most wittily concocted; for my namesake had much about him, in character, of that unassuming and quiet austerity which, while enjoying the poignancy of its own jokes, has no heel of Achilles in itself, and absolutely refuses to be laughed at.|100|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I could find, indeed, but one vulnerable point, and that, lying in a personal peculiarity, arising, perhaps, from constitutional disease, would have been spared by any antagonist less at his wit's end than myself; --my rival had a weakness in the faucal or guttural organs, which precluded him from raising his voice at any time above a very low whisper.|101|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Of this defect I did not fall to take what poor advantage lay in my power.|102|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Wilson's retaliations in kind were many; and there was one form of his practical wit that disturbed me beyond measure.|103|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
How his sagacity first discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me, is a question I never could solve; but, having discovered, he habitually practised the annoyance.|104|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I had always felt aversion to my uncourtly patronymic, and its very common, if not plebeian praenomen.|105|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The words were venom in my ears; and when, upon the day of my arrival, a second William Wilson came also to the academy, I felt angry with him for bearing the name, and doubly disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it, who would be the cause of its twofold repetition, who would be constantly in my presence, and whose concerns, in the ordinary routine of the school business, must inevitably, on account of the detestable coincidence, be often confounded with my own.|106|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every circumstance tending to show resemblance, moral or physical, between my rival and myself.|107|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I had not then discovered the remarkable fact that we were of the same age; but I saw that we were of the same height, and I perceived that we were even singularly alike in general contour of person and outline of feature.|108|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I was galled, too, by the rumor touching a relationship, which had grown current in the upper forms.|109|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
In a word, nothing could more seriously disturb me, although I scrupulously concealed such disturbance,) than any allusion to a similarity of mind, person, or condition existing between us.|110|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
But, in truth, I had no reason to believe that (with the exception of the matter of relationship, and in the case of Wilson himself,) this similarity had ever been made a subject of comment, or even observed at all by our schoolfellows.|111|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
That he observed it in all its bearings, and as fixedly as I, was apparent; but that he could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of annoyance, can only be attributed, as I said before, to his more than ordinary penetration.|112|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
His cue, which was to perfect an imitation of myself, lay both in words and in actions; and most admirably did he play his part.|113|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
My dress it was an easy matter to copy; my gait and general manner were, without difficulty, appropriated; in spite of his constitutional defect, even my voice did not escape him.|114|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
My louder tones were, of course, unattempted, but then the key, it was identical; and his singular whisper, it grew the very echo of my own.|115|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
How greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me, (for it could not justly be termed a caricature,) I will not now venture to describe.|116|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I had but one consolation --in the fact that the imitation, apparently, was noticed by myself alone, and that I had to endure only the knowing and strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself.|117|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Satisfied with having produced in my bosom the intended effect, he seemed to chuckle in secret over the sting he had inflicted, and was characteristically disregardful of the public applause which the success of his witty endeavours might have so easily elicited.|118|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
That the school, indeed, did not feel his design, perceive its accomplishment, and participate in his sneer, was, for many anxious months, a riddle I could not resolve.|119|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Perhaps the gradation of his copy rendered it not so readily perceptible; or, more possibly, I owed my security to the master air of the copyist, who, disdaining the letter, (which in a painting is all the obtuse can see,) gave but the full spirit of his original for my individual contemplation and chagrin.|120|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of patronage which he assumed toward me, and of his frequent officious interference withy my will.|121|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
This interference often took the ungracious character of advice; advice not openly given, but hinted or insinuated.|122|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I received it with a repugnance which gained strength as I grew in years.|123|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Yet, at this distant day, let me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that I can recall no occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the side of those errors or follies so usual to his immature age and seeming inexperience; that his moral sense, at least, if not his general talents and worldly wisdom, was far keener than my own; and that I might, to-day, have been a better, and thus a happier man, had I less frequently rejected the counsels embodied in those meaning whispers which I then but too cordially hated and too bitterly despised.|124|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
As it was, I at length grew restive in the extreme under his distasteful supervision, and daily resented more and more openly what I considered his intolerable arrogance.|125|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I have said that, in the first years of our connexion as schoolmates, my feelings in regard to him might have been easily ripened into friendship: but, in the latter months of my residence at the academy, although the intrusion of his ordinary manner had, beyond doubt, in some measure, abated, my sentiments, in nearly similar proportion, partook very much of positive hatred.|126|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Upon one occasion he saw this, I think, and afterwards avoided, or made a show of avoiding me.|127|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
It was about the same period, if I remember aright, that, in an altercation of violence with him, in which he was more than usually thrown off his guard, and spoke and acted with an openness of demeanor rather foreign to his nature, I discovered, or fancied I discovered, in his accent, his air, and general appearance, a something which first startled, and then deeply interested me, by bringing to mind dim visions of my earliest infancy --wild, confused and thronging memories of a time when memory herself was yet unborn.|128|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I cannot better describe the sensation which oppressed me than by saying that I could with difficulty shake off the belief of my having been acquainted with the being who stood before me, at some epoch very long ago --some point of the past even infinitely remote.|129|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The delusion, however, faded rapidly as it came; and I mention it at all but to define the day of the last conversation I there held with my singular namesake.|130|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The huge old house, with its countless subdivisions, had several large chambers communicating with each other, where slept the greater number of the students.|131|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
There were, however, (as must necessarily happen in a building so awkwardly planned,) many little nooks or recesses, the odds and ends of the structure; and these the economic ingenuity of Dr. Bransby had also fitted up as dormitories; although, being the merest closets, they were capable of accommodating but a single individual.|132|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
One of these small apartments was occupied by Wilson.|133|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
One night, about the close of my fifth year at the school, and immediately after the altercation just mentioned, finding every one wrapped in sleep, I arose from bed, and, lamp in hand, stole through a wilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to that of my rival.|134|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I had long been plotting one of those ill-natured pieces of practical wit at his expense in which I had hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful.|135|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
It was my intention, now, to put my scheme in operation, and I resolved to make him feel the whole extent of the malice with which I was imbued.|136|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Having reached his closet, I noiselessly entered, leaving the lamp, with a shade over it, on the outside.|137|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I advanced a step, and listened to the sound of his tranquil breathing.|138|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Assured of his being asleep, I returned, took the light, and with it again approached the bed.|139|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Close curtains were around it, which, in the prosecution of my plan, I slowly and quietly withdrew, when the bright rays fell vividly upon the sleeper, and my eyes, at the same moment, upon his countenance.|140|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I looked; --and a numbness, an iciness of feeling instantly pervaded my frame.|141|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
My breast heaved, my knees tottered, my whole spirit became possessed with an objectless yet intolerable horror.|142|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Gasping for breath, I lowered the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face.|143|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Were these --these the lineaments of William Wilson?|144|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I saw, indeed, that they were his, but I shook as if with a fit of the ague in fancying they were not.|145|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
What was there about them to confound me in this manner?|146|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I gazed; --while my brain reeled with a multitude of incoherent thoughts.|147|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Not thus he appeared --assuredly not thus --in the vivacity of his waking hours.|148|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The same name!|149|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
the same contour of person!|150|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
the same day of arrival at the academy!|151|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
And then his dogged and meaningless imitation of my gait, my voice, my habits, and my manner!|152|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Was it, in truth, within the bounds of human possibility, that what I now saw was the result, merely, of the habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation?|153|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Awe-stricken, and with a creeping shudder, I extinguished the lamp, passed silently from the chamber, and left, at once, the halls of that old academy, never to enter them again.|154|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
After a lapse of some months, spent at home in mere idleness, I found myself a student at Eton.|155|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The brief interval had been sufficient to enfeeble my remembrance of the events at Dr. Bransby's, or at least to effect a material change in the nature of the feelings with which I remembered them.|156|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The truth --the tragedy --of the drama was no more.|157|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I could now find room to doubt the evidence of my senses; and seldom called up the subject at all but with wonder at extent of human credulity, and a smile at the vivid force of the imagination which I hereditarily possessed.|158|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Neither was this species of scepticism likely to be diminished by the character of the life I led at Eton.|159|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The vortex of thoughtless folly into which I there so immediately and so recklessly plunged, washed away all but the froth of my past hours, engulfed at once every solid or serious impression, and left to memory only the veriest levities of a former existence.|160|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I do not wish, however, to trace the course of my miserable profligacy here --a profligacy which set at defiance the laws, while it eluded the vigilance of the institution.|161|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Three years of folly, passed without profit, had but given me rooted habits of vice, and added, in a somewhat unusual degree, to my bodily stature, when, after a week of soulless dissipation, I invited a small party of the most dissolute students to a secret carousal in my chambers.|162|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
We met at a late hour of the night; for our debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until morning.|163|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The wine flowed freely, and there were not wanting other and perhaps more dangerous seductions; so that the gray dawn had already faintly appeared in the east, while our delirious extravagance was at its height.|164|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Madly flushed with cards and intoxication, I was in the act of insisting upon a toast of more than wonted profanity, when my attention was suddenly diverted by the violent, although partial unclosing of the door of the apartment, and by the eager voice of a servant from without.|165|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
He said that some person, apparently in great haste, demanded to speak with me in the hall.|166|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Wildly excited with wine, the unexpected interruption rather delighted than surprised me.|167|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I staggered forward at once, and a few steps brought me to the vestibule of the building.|168|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
In this low and small room there hung no lamp; and now no light at all was admitted, save that of the exceedingly feeble dawn which made its way through the semi-circular window.|169|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
As I put my foot over the threshold, I became aware of the figure of a youth about my own height, and habited in a white kerseymere morning frock, cut in the novel fashion of the one I myself wore at the moment.|170|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
This the faint light enabled me to perceive; but the features of his face I could not distinguish.|171|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Upon my entering he strode hurriedly up to me, and, seizing me by.|172|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
"the arm with a gesture of petulant impatience, whispered the words ""William Wilson""!"|173|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
in my ear.|174|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I grew perfectly sober in an instant.|175|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
There was that in the manner of the stranger, and in the tremulous shake of his uplifted finger, as he held it between my eyes and the light, which filled me with unqualified amazement; but it was not this which had so violently moved me.|176|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
It was the pregnancy of solemn admonition in the singular, low, hissing utterance; and, above all, it was the character, the tone, the key, of those few, simple, and familiar, yet whispered syllables, which came with a thousand thronging memories of bygone days, and struck upon my soul with the shock of a galvanic battery.|177|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Ere I could recover the use of my senses he was gone.|178|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my disordered imagination, yet was it evanescent as vivid.|179|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
For some weeks, indeed, I busied myself in earnest inquiry, or was wrapped in a cloud of morbid speculation.|180|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I did not pretend to disguise from my perception the identity of the singular individual who thus perseveringly interfered with my affairs, and harassed me with his insinuated counsel.|181|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
But who and what was this Wilson?|182|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
--and whence came he?|183|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
--and what were his purposes?|184|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Upon neither of these points could I be satisfied; merely ascertaining, in regard to him, that a sudden accident in his family had caused his removal from Dr. Bransby's academy on the afternoon of the day in which I myself had eloped.|185|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
But in a brief period I ceased to think upon the subject; my attention being all absorbed in a contemplated departure for Oxford.|186|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Thither I soon went; the uncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with an outfit and annual establishment, which would enable me to indulge at will in the luxury already so dear to my heart, --to vie in profuseness of expenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest earldoms in Great Britain.|187|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Excited by such appliances to vice, my constitutional temperament broke forth with redoubled ardor, and I spurned even the common restraints of decency in the mad infatuation of my revels.|188|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
But it were absurd to pause in the detail of my extravagance.|189|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Let it suffice, that among spendthrifts I out-Heroded Herod, and that, giving name to a multitude of novel follies, I added no brief appendix to the long catalogue of vices then usual in the most dissolute university of Europe.|190|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
It could hardly be credited, however, that I had, even here, so utterly fAllan from the gentlemanly estate, as to seek acquaintance with the vilest arts of the gambler by profession, and, having become an adept in his despicable science, to practise it habitually as a means of increasing my already enormous income at the expense of the weak-minded among my fellow-collegians.|191|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Such, nevertheless, was the fact.|192|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
And the very enormity of this offence against all manly and honourable sentiment proved, beyond doubt, the main if not the sole reason of the impunity with which it was committed.|193|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Who, indeed, among my most abandoned associates, would not rather have disputed the clearest evidence of his senses, than have suspected of such courses, the gay, the frank, the generous William Wilson --the noblest and most commoner at Oxford --him whose follies (said his parasites) were but the follies of youth and unbridled fancy --whose errors but inimitable whim --whose darkest vice but a careless and dashing extravagance?|194|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I had been now two years successfully busied in this way, when there came to the university a young parvenu nobleman, Glendinning --rich, said report, as Herodes Atticus --his riches, too, as easily acquired.|195|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I soon found him of weak intellect, and, of course, marked him as a fitting subject for my skill.|196|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I frequently engaged him in play, and contrived, with the gambler's usual art, to let him win considerable sums, the more effectually to entangle him in my snares.|197|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
At length, my schemes being ripe, I met him (with the full intention that this meeting should be final and decisive) at the chambers of a fellow-commoner, (Mr. Preston,) equally intimate with both, but who, to do him Justice, entertained not even a remote suspicion of my design.|198|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
To give to this a better colouring, I had contrived to have assembled a party of some eight or ten, and was solicitously careful that the introduction of cards should appear accidental, and originate in the proposal of my contemplated dupe himself.|199|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
To be brief upon a vile topic, none of the low finesse was omitted, so customary upon similar occasions that it is a just matter for wonder how any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim.|200|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
We had protracted our sitting far into the night, and I had at length effected the manoeuvre of getting Glendinning as my sole antagonist.|201|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The game, too, was my favorite ecarte!|202|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The rest of the company, interested in the extent of our play, had abandoned their own cards, and were standing around us as spectators.|204|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The parvenu, who had been induced by my artifices in the early part of the evening, to drink deeply, now shuffled, dealt, or played, with a wild nervousness of manner for which his intoxication, I thought, might partially, but could not altogether account.|205|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
In a very short period he had become my debtor to a large amount, when, having taken a long draught of port, he did precisely what I had been coolly anticipating --he proposed to double our already extravagant stakes.|206|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
With a well-feigned show of reluctance, and not until after my repeated refusal had seduced him into some angry words which gave a color of pique to my compliance, did I finally comply.|207|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The result, of course, did but prove how entirely the prey was in my toils; in less than an hour he had quadrupled his debt.|208|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
For some time his countenance had been losing the florid tinge lent it by the wine; but now, to my astonishment, I perceived that it had grown to a pallor truly fearful.|209|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I say to my astonishment.|210|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Glendinning had been represented to my eager inquiries as immeasurably wealthy; and the sums which he had as yet lost, although in themselves vast, could not, I supposed, very seriously annoy, much less so violently affect him.|211|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
That he was overcome by the wine just swallowed, was the idea which most readily presented itself; and, rather with a view to the preservation of my own character in the eyes of my associates, than from any less interested motive, I was about to insist, peremptorily, upon a discontinuance of the play, when some expressions at my elbow from among the company, and an ejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of Glendinning, gave me to understand that I had effected his total ruin under circumstances which, rendering him an object for the pity of all, should have protected him from the ill offices even of a fiend.|212|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
What now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say.|213|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The pitiable condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom over all; and, for some moments, a profound silence was maintained, during which I could not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many burning glances of scorn or reproach cast upon me by the less abandoned of the party.|214|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I will even own that an intolerable weight of anxiety was for a brief instant lifted from my bosom by the sudden and extraordinary interruption which ensued.|215|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The wide, heavy folding doors of the apartment were all at once thrown open, to their full extent, with a vigorous and rushing impetuosity that extinguished, as if by magic, every candle in the room.|216|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Their light, in dying, enabled us just to perceive that a stranger had entered, about my own height, and closely muffled in a cloak.|217|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The darkness, however, was now total; and we could only feel that he was standing in our midst.|218|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Before any one of us could recover from the extreme astonishment into which this rudeness had thrown all, we heard the voice of the intruder.|219|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
"""Gentlemen,"" he said, in a low, distinct, and never-to-be-forgotten whisper which thrilled to the very marrow of my bones, ""Gentlemen, I make no apology for this behaviour, because in thus behaving, I am but fulfilling a duty."|220|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
You are, beyond doubt, uninformed of the true character of the person who has to-night won at ecarte a large sum of money from Lord Glendinning.|221|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I will therefore put you upon an expeditious and decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary information.|222|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
"Please to examine, at your leisure, the inner linings of the cuff of his left sleeve, and the several little packages which may be found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered morning wrapper""."|223|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
While he spoke, so profound was the stillness that one might have heard a pin drop upon the floor.|224|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
In ceasing, he departed at once, and as abruptly as he had entered.|225|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Can I --shall I describe my sensations?|226|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
--must I say that I felt all the horrors of the damned?|227|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Most assuredly I had little time given for reflection.|228|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Many hands roughly seized me upon the spot, and lights were immediately reprocured.|229|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
A search ensued.|230|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
In the lining of my sleeve were found all the court cards essential in ecarte, and, in the pockets of my wrapper, a number of packs, facsimiles of those used at our sittings, with the single exception that mine were of the species called, technically, arrondees; the honours being slightly convex at the ends, the lower cards slightly convex at the sides.|231|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
In this disposition, the dupe who cuts, as customary, at the length of the pack, will invariably find that he cuts his antagonist an honor; while the gambler, cutting at the breadth, will, as certainly, cut nothing for his victim which may count in the records of the game.|232|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Any burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected me less than the silent contempt, or the sarcastic composure, with which it was received.|233|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
"""Mr. Wilson,"" said our host, stooping to remove from beneath his feet an exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs, ""Mr. Wilson, this is your property""."|234|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
(The weather was cold; and, upon quitting my own room, I had thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper, putting it off upon reaching the scene of play.|235|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
") ""I presume it is supererogatory to seek here (eyeing the folds of the garment with a bitter smile) for any farther evidence of your skill."|236|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Indeed, we have had enough.|237|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
"You will see the necessity, I hope, of quitting Oxford --at all events, of quitting instantly my chambers""."|238|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Abased, humbled to the dust as I then was, it is probable that I should have resented this galling language by immediate personal violence, had not my whole attention been at the moment arrested by a fact of the most startling character.|239|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The cloak which I had worn was of a rare description of fur; how rare, how extravagantly costly, I shall not venture to say.|240|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Its fashion, too, was of my own fantastic invention; for I was fastidious to an absurd degree of coxcombry, in matters of this frivolous nature.|241|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
When, therefore, Mr. Preston reached me that which he had picked up upon the floor, and near the folding doors of the apartment, it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon terror, that I perceived my own already hanging on my arm, (where I had no doubt unwittingly placed it,) and that the one presented me was but its exact counterpart in every, in even the minutest possible particular.|242|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The singular being who had so disastrously exposed me, had been muffled, I remembered, in a cloak; and none had been worn at all by any of the members of our party with the exception of myself.|243|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Retaining some presence of mind, I took the one offered me by Preston; placed it, unnoticed, over my own; left the apartment with a resolute scowl of defiance; and, next morning ere dawn of day, commenced a hurried journey from Oxford to the continent, in a perfect agony of horror and of shame.|244|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I fled in vain.|245|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
My evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation, and proved, indeed, that the exercise of its mysterious dominion had as yet only begun.|246|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Scarcely had I set foot in Paris ere I had fresh evidence of the detestable interest taken by this Wilson in my concerns.|247|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Years flew, while I experienced no relief.|248|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Villain!|249|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
--at Rome, with how untimely, yet with how spectral an officiousness, stepped he in between me and my ambition!|250|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
At Vienna, too --at Berlin --and at Moscow!|251|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Where, in truth, had I not bitter cause to curse him within my heart?|252|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
From his inscrutable tyranny did I at length flee, panic-stricken, as from a pestilence; and to the very ends of the earth I fled in vain.|253|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
"And again, and again, in secret communion with my own spirit, would I demand the questions ""Who is he?"|254|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
--whence came he?|255|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
"--and what are his objects""?"|256|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
But no answer was there found.|257|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
And then I scrutinized, with a minute scrutiny, the forms, and the methods, and the leading traits of his impertinent supervision.|258|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
But even here there was very little upon which to base a conjecture.|259|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
It was noticeable, indeed, that, in no one of the multiplied instances in which he had of late crossed my path, had he so crossed it except to frustrate those schemes, or to disturb those actions, which, if fully carried out, might have resulted in bitter mischief.|260|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Poor justification this, in truth, for an authority so imperiously assumed!|261|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Poor indemnity for natural rights of self-agency so pertinaciously, so insultingly denied!|262|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I had also been forced to notice that my tormentor, for a very long period of time, (while scrupulously and with miraculous dexterity maintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with myself,) had so contrived it, in the execution of his varied interference with my will, that I saw not, at any moment, the features of his face.|263|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Be Wilson what he might, this, at least, was but the veriest of affectation, or of folly.|264|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Could he, for an instant, have supposed that, in my admonisher at Eton --in the destroyer of my honor at Oxford, --in him who thwarted my ambition at Rome, my revenge at Paris, my passionate love at Naples, or what he falsely termed my avarice in Egypt, --that in this, my arch-enemy and evil genius, could fall to recognise the William Wilson of my school boy days, --the namesake, the companion, the rival, --the hated and dreaded rival at Dr. Bransby's?|265|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Impossible!|266|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
--But let me hasten to the last eventful scene of the drama.|267|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Thus far I had succumbed supinely to this imperious domination.|268|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The sentiment of deep awe with which I habitually regarded the elevated character, the majestic wisdom, the apparent omnipresence and omnipotence of Wilson, added to a feeling of even terror, with which certain other traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me, had operated, hitherto, to impress me with an idea of my own utter weakness and helplessness, and to suggest an implicit, although bitterly reluctant submission to his arbitrary will.|269|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
But, of late days, I had given myself up entirely to wine; and its maddening influence upon my hereditary temper rendered me more and more impatient of control.|270|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I began to murmur, --to hesitate, --to resist.|271|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
And was it only fancy which induced me to believe that, with the increase of my own firmness, that of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution?|272|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Be this as it may, I now began to feel the inspiration of a burning hope, and at length nurtured in my secret thoughts a stern and desperate resolution that I would submit no longer to be enslaved.|273|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
It was at Rome, during the Carnival of 18--, that I attended a masquerade in the palazzo of the Neapolitan Duke Di Broglio.|274|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I had indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the wine-table; and now the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms irritated me beyond endurance.|275|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The difficulty, too, of forcing my way through the mazes of the company contributed not a little to the ruffling of my temper; for I was anxiously seeking, (let me not say with what unworthy motive) the young, the gay, the beautiful wife of the aged and doting Di Broglio.|276|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
With a too unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to me the secret of the costume in which she would be habited, and now, having caught a glimpse of her person, I was hurrying to make my way into her presence.|277|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
--At this moment I felt a light hand placed upon my shoulder, and that ever-remembered, low, damnable whisper within my ear.|278|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
In an absolute phrenzy of wrath, I turned at once upon him who had thus interrupted me, and seized him violently by tile collar.|279|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
He was attired, as I had expected, in a costume altogether similar to my own; wearing a Spanish cloak of blue velvet, begirt about the waist with a crimson belt sustaining a rapier.|280|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
A mask of black silk entirely covered his face.|281|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
"""Scoundrel""!"|282|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
"I said, in a voice husky with rage, while every syllable I uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury, ""scoundrel!"|283|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
impostor!|284|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
accursed villain!|285|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
you shall not --you shall not dog me unto death!|286|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
"Follow me, or I stab you where you stand""!"|287|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
--and I broke my way from the ball-room into a small ante-chamber adjoining --dragging him unresistingly with me as I went.|288|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Upon entering, I thrust him furiously from me.|289|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
He staggered against the wall, while I closed the door with an oath, and commanded him to draw.|290|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
He hesitated but for an instant; then, with a slight sigh, drew in silence, and put himself upon his defence.|291|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The contest was brief indeed.|292|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I was frantic with every species of wild excitement, and felt within my single arm the energy and power of a multitude.|293|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
In a few seconds I forced him by sheer strength against the wainscoting, and thus, getting him at mercy, plunged my sword, with brute ferocity, repeatedly through and through his bosom.|294|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
At that instant some person tried the latch of the door.|295|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
I hastened to prevent an intrusion, and then immediately returned to my dying antagonist.|296|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
But what human language can adequately portray that astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then presented to view?|297|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
The brief moment in which I averted my eyes had been sufficient to produce, apparently, a material change in the arrangements at the upper or farther end of the room.|298|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
A large mirror, --so at first it seemed to me in my confusion --now stood where none had been perceptible before; and, as I stepped up to it in extremity of terror, mine own image, but with features all pale and dabbled in blood, advanced to meet me with a feeble and tottering gait.|299|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Thus it appeared, I say, but was not.|300|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
It was my antagonist --it was Wilson, who then stood before me in the agonies of his dissolution.|301|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
His mask and cloak lay, where he had thrown them, upon the floor.|302|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Not a thread in all his raiment --not a line in all the marked and singular lineaments of his face which was not, even in the most absolute identity, mine own!|303|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
"It was Wilson; but he spoke no longer in a whisper, and I could have fancied that I myself was speaking while he said: ""You have conquered, and I yield."|304|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
Yet, henceforward art thou also dead --dead to the World, to Heaven and to Hope!|305|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror
"In me didst thou exist --and, in my death, see by this image, which is thine own, how utterly thou hast murdered thyself""."|306|1|William Wilson|October 1839|Horror

Your mind wavers, and its agitation will find relief in the exercise of simple memories.|3|11|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
Look not around, nor forward; but back.|4|11|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
I am burning with anxiety to hear the details of that stupendous event which threw you among us.|5|11|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
Tell me of it.|6|11|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction

To that last hour of all, there hung a cloud of intense gloom and devout sorrow over your household.|3|14|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
CHARMION.|0|15|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
And that last hour; speak of it.|1|15|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
Remember that, beyond the naked fact of the catastrophe itself, I know nothing.|2|15|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
When, coming out from among mankind, I passed into Night through the Grave; at that period, if I remember aright, the calamity which overwhelmed you was utterly unanticipated.|3|15|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
But, indeed, I knew little of the speculative philosophy of the day.|4|15|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
EIROS.|0|16|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
The individual calamity was, as you say, entirely unanticipated; but analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion with astronomers.|1|16|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
I need scarce tell you, my friend, that, even when you left us, men had agreed to understand those passages in the most holy writings which speak of the final destruction of all things by fire, as having reference to the orb of the earth alone.|2|16|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
But in regard to the immediate agency of the ruin, speculation had been at fault from that epoch in astronomical knowledge in which the comets were divested of the terrors of flame.|3|16|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
The very moderate density of these bodies had been well established.|4|16|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
They had been observed to pass among the satellites of Jupiter, without bringing about any sensible alteration either in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets.|5|16|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
We had long regarded the wanderers as vapory creations of inconceivable tenuity, and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our substantial globe, even in the event of contact.|6|16|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
But contact was not in any degree dreaded; for the elements of all the comets were accurately known.|7|16|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
That among them we should look for the agency of the threatened fiery destruction had been for many years considered an inadmissible idea.|8|16|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
But wonders and wild fancies had been, of late days, strangely rife among mankind; and although it was only with a few of the ignorant that actual apprehension prevailed, upon the announcement by astronomers of a new comet, yet this announcement was generally received with I know not what of agitation and mistrust.|9|16|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
The elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated, and it was at once conceded by all observers, that its path, at perihelion, would bring it into very close proximity with the earth.|0|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
There were two or three astronomers, of secondary note, who resolutely maintained that a contact was inevitable.|1|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
I cannot very well express to you the effect of this intelligence upon the people.|2|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
For a few short days they would not believe an assertion which their intellect, so long employed among worldly considerations, could not in any manner grasp.|3|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
But the truth of a vitally important fact soon makes its way into the understanding of even the most stolid.|4|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
Finally, all men saw that astronomical knowledge lied not, and they awaited the comet.|5|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
Its approach was not, at first, seemingly rapid; nor was its appearance of very unusual character.|6|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
It was of a dull red, and had little perceptible train.|7|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
For seven or eight days we saw no material increase in its apparent diameter, and but a partial alteration in its color.|8|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
Meantime the ordinary affairs of men were discarded, and all interests absorbed in a growing discussion, instituted by the philosophic, in respect to the cometary nature.|9|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
Even the grossly ignorant aroused their sluggish capacities to such considerations.|10|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
The learned now gave their intellect; their soul; to no such points as the allaying of fear, or to the sustenance of loved theory.|11|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
They sought- they panted for right views.|12|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
They groaned for perfected knowledge.|13|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
Truth arose in the purity of her strength and exceeding majesty, and the wise bowed down and adored.|14|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
That material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would result from the apprehended contact, was an opinion which hourly lost ground among the wise; and the wise were now freely permitted to rule the reason and the fancy of the crowd.|0|18|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
It was demonstrated, that the density of the comet's nucleus was far less than that of our rarest gas; and the harmless passage of a similar visitor among the satellites of Jupiter was a point strongly insisted upon, and which served greatly to allay terror.|1|18|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
Theologists, with an earnestness fear-enkindled, dwelt upon the biblical prophecies, and expounded them to the people with a directness and simplicity of which no previous instance had been known.|2|18|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
That the final destruction of the earth must be brought about by the agency of fire, was urged with a spirit that enforced everywhere conviction; and that the comets were of no fiery nature (as all men now knew) was a truth which relieved all, in a great measure, from the apprehension of the great calamity foretold.|3|18|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
It is noticeable that the popular prejudices and vulgar errors in regard to pestilences and wars; errors which were wont to prevail upon every appearance of a comet; were now altogether unknown.|4|18|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
As if by some sudden convulsive exertion, reason had at once hurled superstition from her throne.|5|18|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
The feeblest intellect had derived vigor from excessive interest.|6|18|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
What minor evils might arise from the contact were points of elaborate question.|0|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
The learned spoke of slight geological disturbances, of probable alterations in climate, and consequently in vegetation; of possible magnetic and electric influences.|1|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
Many held that no visible or perceptible effect would in any manner be produced.|2|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
While such discussions were going on, their subject gradually approached, growing larger in apparent diameter, and of a more brilliant lustre.|3|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
Mankind grew paler as it came.|4|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
All human operations were suspended.|5|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
There was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when the comet had attained, at length, a size surpassing that of any previously recorded visitation.|6|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
The people now, dismissing any lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong, experienced all the certainty of evil.|7|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
The chimerical aspect of their terror was gone.|8|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
The hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently within their bosoms.|9|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
A very few days sufficed, however, to merge even such feelings in sentiments more unendurable.|10|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
We could no longer apply to the strange orb any accustomed thoughts.|11|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
Its historical attributes had disappeared.|12|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
It oppressed us with a hideous novelty of emotion.|13|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
We saw it not as an astronomical phenomenon in the heavens, but as an incubus upon our hearts, and a shadow upon our brains.|14|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
It had taken, with inconceivable rapidity, the character of a gigantic mantle of rare flame, extending from horizon to horizon.|15|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
Yet a day, and men breathed with greater freedom.|0|20|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
It was clear that we were already within the influence of the comet; yet we lived.|1|20|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
We even felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity of mind.|2|20|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
The exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was apparent; for all heavenly objects were plainly visible through it.|3|20|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
Meantime, our vegetation had perceptibly altered; and we gained faith, from this predicted circumstance, in the foresight of the wise.|4|20|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
A wild luxuriance of foliage, utterly unknown before, burst out upon every vegetable thing.|5|20|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
Yet another day; and the evil was not altogether upon us.|0|21|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
It was now evident that its nucleus would first reach us.|1|21|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
A wild change had come over all men; and the first sense of pain was the wild signal for general lamentation and horror.|2|21|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
This first sense of pain lay in a rigorous constriction of the breast and lungs, and an insufferable dryness of the skin.|3|21|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
It could not be denied that our atmosphere was radically affected; the conformation of this atmosphere and the possible modifications to which it might be subjected, were now the topics of discussion.|4|21|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
The result of investigation sent an electric thrill of the intensest terror through the universal heart of man.|5|21|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
It had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound of oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of twenty-one measures of oxygen, and seventy-nine of nitrogen, in every one hundred of the atmosphere.|0|22|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
Oxygen, which was the principle of combustion, and the vehicle of heat, was absolutely necessary to the support of animal life, and was the most powerful and energetic agent in nature.|1|22|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
Nitrogen, on the contrary, was incapable of supporting either animal life or flame.|2|22|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
An unnatural excess of oxygen would result, it had been ascertained, in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had latterly experienced.|3|22|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
It was the pursuit, the extension of the idea, which had engendered awe.|4|22|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
What would be the result of a total extraction of the nitrogen?|5|22|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
A combustion irresistible, all-devouring, omni-prevalent, immediate; the entire fulfillment, in all their minute and terrible details, of the fiery and horror-inspiring denunciations of the prophecies of the Holy Book.|6|22|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
Why need I paint, Charmion, the now disenchained frenzy of mankind?|0|23|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
That tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us with hope, was now the source of the bitterness of despair.|1|23|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
In its impalpable gaseous character we clearly perceived the consummation of Fate.|2|23|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
Meantime a day again passed, bearing away with it the last shadow of Hope.|3|23|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
We gasped in the rapid modification of the air.|4|23|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
The red blood bounded tumultuously through its strict channels.|5|23|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction

For a moment there was a wild lurid light alone, visiting and penetrating all things.|9|23|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
Then; let us bow down, Charmion, before the excessive majesty of the great God!|10|23|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction
; then, there came a shouting and pervading sound, as if from the mouth itself of HIM; while the whole incumbent mass of ether in which we existed, burst at once into a species of intense flame, for whose surpassing brilliancy and all-fervid heat even the angels in the high Heaven of pure knowledge have no name.|11|23|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|December 1839|Science fiction

Method is the soul of business.|0|1|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
OLD SAYING.|1|1|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
I AM a business man.|0|2|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
I am a methodical man.|1|2|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Method is the thing, after all.|2|2|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
But there are no people I more heartily despise than your eccentric fools who prate about method without understanding it; attending strictly to its letter, and violating its spirit.|3|2|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
These fellows are always doing the most out-of-the-way things in what they call an orderly manner.|4|2|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Now here, I conceive, is a positive paradox.|5|2|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
True method appertains to the ordinary and the obvious alone, and cannot be applied to the outre.|6|2|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
"What definite idea can a body attach to such expressions as ""methodical Jack o' Dandy,"" or ""a systematical Will o' the Wisp""?"|7|2|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
My notions upon this head might not have been so clear as they are, but for a fortunate accident which happened to me when I was a very little boy.|0|3|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
A good-hearted old Irish nurse (whom I shall not forget in my will) took me up one day by the heels, when I was making more noise than was necessary, and swinging me round two or knocked my head into a cocked hat against the bedpost.|1|3|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
This, I say, decided my fate, and made my fortune.|2|3|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
A bump arose at once on my sinciput, and turned out to be as pretty an organ of order as one shall see on a summer's day.|3|3|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Hence that positive appetite for system and regularity which has made me the distinguished man of business that I am.|4|3|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
If there is any thing on earth I hate, it is a genius.|0|4|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Your geniuses are all arrant asses;the greater the genius the greater the ass- and to this rule there is no exception whatever.|1|4|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Especially, you cannot make a man of business out of a genius, any more than money out of a Jew, or the best nutmegs out of pine-knots.|2|4|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
"The creatures are always going off at a tangent into some fantastic employment, or ridiculous speculation, entirely at variance with the ""fitness of things,"" and having no business whatever to be considered as a business at all."|3|4|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Thus you may tell these characters immediately by the nature of their occupations.|4|4|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
If you ever perceive a man setting up as a merchant or a manufacturer, or going into the cotton or tobacco trade, or any of those eccentric pursuits; or getting to be a drygoods dealer, or soap-boiler, or something of that kind; or pretending to be a lawyer, or a blacksmith, or a physician;any thing out of the usual way;you may set him down at once as a genius, and then, according to the rule-of-three, he's an ass.|5|4|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Now I am not in any respect a genius, but a regular business man.|0|5|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
My Day-book and Ledger will evince this in a minute.|1|5|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
They are well kept, though I say it myself; and, in my general habits of accuracy and punctuality, I am not to be beat by a clock.|2|5|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Moreover, my occupations have been always made to chime in with the ordinary habitudes of my fellowmen.|3|5|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Not that I feel the least indebted, upon this score, to my exceedingly weak-minded parents, who, beyond doubt, would have made an arrant genius of me at last, if my guardian angel had not come, in good time, to the rescue.|4|5|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
"In biography the truth is every thing, and in autobiography it is especially so- yet I scarcely hope to be believed when I state, however solemnly, that my poor father put me, when I was about fifteen years of age, into the counting-house of what be termed ""a respectable hardware and commission merchant doing a capital bit of business""!"|5|5|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
A capital bit of fiddlestick!|6|5|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
However, the consequence of this folly was, that in two or three days, I had to be sent home to my button-headed family in a high state of fever, and with a most violent and dangerous pain in the sinciput, all around about my organ of order.|7|5|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
It was nearly a gone case with me then;just touch-and-go for six weeks;the physicians giving me up and all that sort of thing.|8|5|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
But, although I suffered much, I was a thankful boy in the main.|9|5|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
"I was saved from being a ""respectable hardware and commission merchant, doing a capital bit of business,"" and I felt grateful to the protuberance which had been the means of my salvation, as well as to the kindhearted female who had originally put these means within my reach."|10|5|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
The most of boys run away from home at ten or twelve years of age, but I waited till I was sixteen.|0|6|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
I don't know that I should have gone even then, if I had not happened to hear my old mother talk about setting me up on my own hook in the grocery way.|1|6|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
The grocery way!|2|6|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
- only think of that!|3|6|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
I resolved to be off forthwith, and try and establish myself in some decent occupation, without dancing attendance any longer upon the caprices of these eccentric old people, and running the risk of being made a genius of in the end.|4|6|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
In this project I succeeded perfectly well at the first effort, and by the time I was fairly eighteen, found myself doing an extensive and profitable business in the Tailor's Walking-Advertisement line.|5|6|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
I was enabled to discharge the onerous duties of this profession, only by that rigid adherence to system which formed the leading feature of my mind.|0|7|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
A scrupulous method characterized my actions as well as my accounts.|1|7|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
In my case it was method;not money;which made the man: at least all of him that was not made by the tailor whom I served.|2|7|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor

The precise regularity with which I turned my handsome person about, so as to bring successively into view every portion of the suit upon my back, was the admiration of all the knowing men in the trade.|5|7|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Noon never passed without my bringing home a customer to the house of my employers, Messrs.|6|7|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor

I say this proudly, but with tears in my eyes;for the firm proved themselves the basest of ingrates.|8|7|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
The little account, about which we quarreled and finally parted, cannot, in any item, be thought overcharged, by gentlemen really conversant with the nature of the business.|9|7|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor

The item chiefly disputed in this bill was the very moderate charge of two pennies for the dickey.|0|11|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Upon my word of honor, this was not an unreasonable price for that dickey.|1|11|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
It was one of the cleanest and prettiest little dickeys I ever saw; and I have good reason to believe that it effected the sale of three Petershams.|2|11|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
The elder partner of the firm, however, would allow me only one penny of the charge, and took it upon himself to show in what manner four of the same sized conveniences could be got out of a sheet of foolscap.|3|11|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
But it is needless to say that I stood upon the principle of the thing.|4|11|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Business is business, and should be done in a business way.|5|11|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
There was no system whatever in swindling me out of a penny;a clear fraud of fifty per cent;no method in any respect.|6|11|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor

I found myself driving a flourishing trade, and soon became a marked man upon 'Change.|1|12|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
The truth is, I never dabbled in flashy matters, but jogged on in the good old sober routine of the calling;a calling in which I should, no doubt, have remained to the present hour, but for a little accident which happened to me in the prosecution of one of the usual business operations of the profession.|2|12|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Whenever a rich old hunks or prodigal heir or bankrupt corporation gets into the notion of putting up a palace, there is no such thing in the world as stopping either of them, and this every intelligent person knows.|3|12|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
The fact in question is indeed the basis of the Eye-Sore trade.|4|12|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
As soon, therefore, as a building-project is fairly afoot by one of these parties, we merchants secure a nice corner of the lot in contemplation, or a prime little situation just adjoining, or tight in front.|5|12|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
This done, we wait until the palace is half-way up, and then we pay some tasty architect to run us up an ornamental mud hovel, right against it; or a Down-East or Dutch Pagoda, or a pig-sty, or an ingenious little bit of fancy work, either Esquimau, Kickapoo, or Hottentot.|6|12|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Of course we can't afford to take these structures down under a bonus of five hundred per cent upon the prime cost of our lot and plaster.|7|12|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Can we?|8|12|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
I ask the question.|9|12|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
I ask it of business men.|10|12|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
It would be irrational to suppose that we can.|11|12|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
And yet there was a rascally corporation which asked me to do this very thing;this very thing!|12|12|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
I did not reply to their absurd proposition, of course; but I felt it a duty to go that same night, and lamp-black the whole of their palace.|13|12|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
For this the unreasonable villains clapped me into jail; and the gentlemen of the Eye-Sore trade could not well avoid cutting my connection when I came out.|14|12|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
The Assault-and-Battery business, into which I was now forced to adventure for a livelihood, was somewhat ill-adapted to the delicate nature of my constitution; but I went to work in it with a good heart, and found my account here, as heretofore, in those stern habits of methodical accuracy which had been thumped into me by that delightful old nurse;I would indeed be the basest of men not to remember her well in my will.|0|13|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
By observing, as I say, the strictest system in all my dealings, and keeping a well-regulated set of books, I was enabled to get over many serious difficulties, and, in the end, to establish myself very decently in the profession.|1|13|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
The truth is, that few individuals, in any line, did a snugger little business than I. I will just copy a page or so out of my Day-Book; and this will save me the necessity of blowing my own trumpet;a contemptible practice of which no high-minded man will be guilty.|2|13|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor

"Nett profit,;see Journal,;seventy-five cents""."|4|18|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Now, here is a clear gain, in a very brief period, of no less than one dollar and twenty-five cents;this is in the mere cases of Snap and Gruff; and I solemnly assure the reader that these extracts are taken at random from my Day-Book.|0|19|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
It's an old saying, and a true one, however, that money is nothing in comparison with health.|0|20|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
I found the exactions of the profession somewhat too much for my delicate state of body; and, discovering, at last, that I was knocked all out of shape, so that I didn't know very well what to make of the matter, and so that my friends, when they met me in the street, couldn't tell that I was Peter Proffit at all, it occurred to me that the best expedient I could adopt was to alter my line of business.|1|20|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
I turned my attention, therefore, to Mud-Dabbling, and continued it for some years.|2|20|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
The worst of this occupation is, that too many people take a fancy to it, and the competition is in consequence excessive.|0|21|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Every ignoramus of a fellow who finds that he hasn't brains in sufficient quantity to make his way as a walking advertiser, or an eye-sore prig, or a salt-and-batter man, thinks, of course, that he'll answer very well as a dabbler of mud.|1|21|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
But there never was entertained a more erroneous idea than that it requires no brains to mud-dabble.|2|21|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Especially, there is nothing to be made in this way without method.|3|21|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
I did only a retail business myself, but my old habits of system carried me swimmingly along.|4|21|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
I selected my street-crossing, in the first place, with great deliberation, and I never put down a broom in any part of the town but that.|5|21|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
I took care, too, to have a nice little puddle at hand, which I could get at in a minute.|6|21|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
By these means I got to be well known as a man to be trusted; and this is one-half the battle, let me tell you, in trade.|7|21|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Nobody ever failed to pitch me a copper, and got over my crossing with a clean pair of pantaloons.|8|21|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
And, as my business habits, in this respect, were sufficiently understood, I never met with any attempt at imposition.|9|21|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
I wouldn't have put up with it, if I had.|10|21|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Never imposing upon any one myself, I suffered no one to play the possum with me.|11|21|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
The frauds of the banks of course I couldn't help.|12|21|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Their suspension put me to ruinous inconvenience.|13|21|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
These, however, are not individuals, but corporations; and corporations, it is very well known, have neither bodies to be kicked nor souls to be damned.|14|21|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
I was making money at this business when, in an evil moment, I was induced to merge it in the Cur-Spattering;a somewhat analogous, but, by no means, so respectable a profession.|0|22|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
My location, to be sure, was an excellent one, being central, and I had capital blacking and brushes.|1|22|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
My little dog, too, was quite fat and up to all varieties of snuff.|2|22|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
He had been in the trade a long time, and, I may say, understood it.|3|22|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Our general routine was this:;Pompey, having rolled himself well in the mud, sat upon end at the shop door, until he observed a dandy approaching in bright boots.|4|22|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
He then proceeded to meet him, and gave the Wellingtons a rub or two with his wool.|5|22|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Then the dandy swore very much, and looked about for a boot-black.|6|22|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
There I was, full in his view, with blacking and brushes.|7|22|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
It was only a minute's work, and then came a sixpence.|8|22|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
This did moderately well for a time;;in fact, I was not avaricious, but my dog was.|9|22|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
I allowed him a third of the profit, but he was advised to insist upon half.|10|22|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
This I couldn't stand;so we quarrelled and parted.|11|22|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
I next tried my hand at the Organ-Grinding for a while, and may say that I made out pretty well.|0|23|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
It is a plain, straightforward business, and requires no particular abilities.|1|23|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
You can get a music-mill for a mere song, and to put it in order, you have but to open the works, and give them three or four smart raps with a hammer.|2|23|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
In improves the tone of the thing, for business purposes, more than you can imagine.|3|23|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
This done, you have only to stroll along, with the mill on your back, until you see tanbark in the street, and a knocker wrapped up in buckskin.|4|23|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Then you stop and grind; looking as if you meant to stop and grind till doomsday.|5|23|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
"Presently a window opens, and somebody pitches you a sixpence, with a request to ""Hush up and go on,"" etc."|6|23|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
"I am aware that some grinders have actually afforded to ""go on"" for this sum; but for my part, I found the necessary outlay of capital too great to permit of my ""going on"" under a shilling."|7|23|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
At this occupation I did a good deal; but, somehow, I was not quite satisfied, and so finally abandoned it.|0|24|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
The truth is, I labored under the disadvantage of having no monkey;and American streets are so muddy, and a Democratic rabble is so obstrusive, and so full of demnition mischievous little boys.|1|24|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
I was now out of employment for some months, but at length succeeded, by dint of great interest, in procuring a situation in the Sham-Post.|0|25|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
The duties, here, are simple, and not altogether unprofitable.|1|25|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
For example:;very early in the morning I had to make up my packet of sham letters.|2|25|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Upon the inside of each of these I had to scrawl a few lines on any subject which occurred to me as sufficiently mysterious;signing all the epistles Tom Dobson, or Bobby Tompkins, or anything in that way.|3|25|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Having folded and sealed all, and stamped them with sham postmarks;New Orleans, Bengal, Botany Bay, or any other place a great way off;I set out, forthwith, upon my daily route, as if in a very great hurry.|4|25|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
I always called at the big houses to deliver the letters, and receive the postage.|5|25|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Nobody hesitates at paying for a letter;especially for a double one;people are such fools;and it was no trouble to get round a corner before there was time to open the epistles.|6|25|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
The worst of this profession was, that I had to walk so much and so fast; and so frequently to vary my route.|7|25|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Besides, I had serious scruples of conscience.|8|25|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
I can't bear to hear innocent individuals abused;and the way the whole town took to cursing Tom Dobson and Bobby Tompkins was really awful to hear.|9|25|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
I washed my hands of the matter in disgust.|10|25|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
My eighth and last speculation has been in the Cat-Growing way.|0|26|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
I have found that a most pleasant and lucrative business, and, really, no trouble at all.|1|26|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
The country, it is well known, has become infested with cats;so much so of late, that a petition for relief, most numerously and respectably signed, was brought before the Legislature at its late memorable session.|2|26|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
The Assembly, at this epoch, was unusually well-informed, and, having passed many other wise and wholesome enactments, it crowned all with the Cat-Act.|3|26|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
"In its original form, this law offered a premium for cat-heads (fourpence a-piece), but the Senate succeeded in amending the main clause, so as to substitute the word ""tails"" for ""heads""."|4|26|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
This amendment was so obviously proper, that the House concurred in it nem.|5|26|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor

As soon as the governor had signed the bill, I invested my whole estate in the purchase of Toms and Tabbies.|0|27|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
At first I could only afford to feed them upon mice (which are cheap), but they fulfilled the scriptural injunction at so marvellous a rate, that I at length considered it my best policy to be liberal, and so indulged them in oysters and turtle.|1|27|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
Their tails, at a legislative price, now bring me in a good income; for I have discovered a way, in which, by means of Macassar oil, I can force three crops in a year.|2|27|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
It delights me to find, too, that the animals soon get accustomed to the thing, and would rather have the appendages cut off than otherwise.|3|27|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor
I consider myself, therefore, a made man, and am bargaining for a country seat on the Hudson.|4|27|The Business Man|February 1840|Humor

"IT WAS well said of a certain German book that ""er lasst sich nicht lesen""–it does not permit itself to be read."|0|1|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
There are some secrets which do not permit themselves to be told.|1|1|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Men die nightly in their beds, wringing the hands of ghostly confessors, and looking them piteously in the eyes–die with despair of heart and convulsion of throat, on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer themselves to be revealed.|2|1|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Now and then, alas, the conscience of man takes up a burden so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only into the grave.|3|1|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
And thus the essence of all crime is undivulged.|4|1|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Not long ago, about the closing in of an evening in autumn, I sat at the large bow–window of the D-–Coffee-House in London.|0|2|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
For some months I had been ill in health, but was now convalescent, and, with returning strength, found myself in one of those happy moods which are so precisely the converse of ennui-moods of the keenest appetency, when the film from the mental vision departs–achlus os prin epeen- and the intellect, electrified, surpasses as greatly its everyday condition, as does the vivid yet candid reason of Leibnitz, the mad and flimsy rhetoric of Gorgias.|1|2|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Merely to breathe was enjoyment; and I derived positive pleasure even from many of the legitimate sources of pain.|2|2|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
I felt a calm but inquisitive interest in every thing.|3|2|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
With a cigar in my mouth and a newspaper in my lap, I had been amusing myself for the greater part of the afternoon, now in poring over advertisements, now in observing the promiscuous company in the room, and now in peering through the smoky panes into the street.|4|2|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
This latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city, and had been very much crowded during the whole day.|0|3|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
But, as the darkness came on, the throng momently increased; and, by the time the lamps were well lighted, two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past the door.|1|3|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
At this particular period of the evening I had never before been in a similar situation, and the tumultuous sea of human heads filled me, therefore, with a delicious novelty of emotion.|2|3|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
I gave up, at length, all care of things within the hotel, and became absorbed in contemplation of the scene without.|3|3|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
At first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn.|0|4|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
I looked at the passengers in masses, and thought of them in their aggregate relations.|1|4|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Soon, however, I descended to details, and regarded with minute interest the innumerable varieties of figure, dress, air, gait, visage, and expression of countenance.|2|4|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
By far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied, business-like demeanor, and seemed to be thinking only of making their way through the press.|0|5|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Their brows were knit, and their eyes rolled quickly; when pushed against by fellow-wayfarers they evinced no symptom of impatience, but adjusted their clothes and hurried on.|1|5|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Others, still a numerous class, were restless in their movements, had flushed faces, and talked and gesticulated to themselves, as if feeling in solitude on account of the very denseness of the company around.|2|5|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
When impeded in their progress, these people suddenly ceased muttering; but redoubled their gesticulations, and awaited, with an absent and overdone smile upon their lips, the course of the persons impeding them.|3|5|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
If jostled, they bowed profusely to the jostlers, and appeared overwhelmed with confusion.|4|5|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
There was nothing very distinctive about these two large classes beyond what I have noted.|5|5|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Their habiliments belonged to that order which is pointedly termed the decent.|6|5|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
They were undoubtedly noblemen, merchants, attorneys, tradesmen, stock-jobbers–the Eupatrids and the common-places of society–men of leisure and men actively engaged in affairs of their own–conducting business upon their own responsibility.|7|5|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
They did not greatly excite my attention.|8|5|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
The tribe of clerks was an obvious one; and here I discerned two remarkable divisions.|0|6|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
There were the junior clerks of flash houses- young gentlemen with tight coats, bright boots, well-oiled hair, and supercilious lips.|1|6|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Setting aside a certain dapperness of carriage, which may be termed deskism for want of a better word, the manner of these persons seemed to be an exact facsimile of what had been the perfection of bon ton about twelve or eighteen months before.|2|6|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
They wore the castoff graces of the gentry;–and this, I believe, involves the best definition of the class.|3|6|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
"The division of the upper clerks of staunch firms, or of the ""steady old fellows,"" it was not possible to mistake."|0|7|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
These were known by their coats and pantaloons of black or brown, made to sit comfortably, with white cravats and waistcoats, broad solid-looking shoes, and thick hose or gaiters.|1|7|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
They had all slightly bald heads, from which the right ears, long used to pen-holding, had an odd habit of standing off on end.|2|7|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
I observed that they always removed or settled their hats with both bands, and wore watches, with short gold chains of a substantial and ancient pattern.|3|7|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Theirs was the affectation of respectability–if indeed there be an affectation so honorable.|4|7|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
There were many individuals of dashing appearance, whom I easily understood as belonging to the race of swell pick-pockets, with which all great cities are infested.|0|8|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
I watched these gentry with much inquisitiveness, and found it difficult to imagine how they should ever be mistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen themselves.|1|8|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Their voluminousness of wristband, with an air of excessive frankness, should betray them at once.|2|8|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
The gamblers, of whom I descried not a few, were still more easily recognizable.|0|9|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
They wore every variety of dress, from that of the desperate thimble-rig bully, with velvet waistcoat, fancy neckerchief, gilt chains, and filagreed buttons, to that of the scrupulously inornate clergyman, than which nothing could be less liable to suspicion.|1|9|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Still all were distinguished by a certain sodden swarthiness of complexion, a filmy dimness of eye, and pallor and compression of lip.|2|9|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
There were two other traits, moreover, by which I could always detect them: a guarded lowness of tone in conversation, and a more than ordinary extension of the thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers.|3|9|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Very often, in company with these sharpers, I observed an order of men somewhat different in habits, but still birds of a kindred feather.|4|9|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
They may be defined as the gentlemen who live by their wits.|5|9|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
They seem to prey upon the public in two battalions–that of the dandies and that of the military men.|6|9|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Of the first grade the leading features are long locks and smiles; of the second, frogged coats and frowns.|7|9|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Descending in the scale of what is termed gentility, I found darker and deeper themes for speculation.|0|10|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
I saw Jew pedlars, with hawk eyes flashing from countenances whose every other feature wore only an expression of abject humility; sturdy professional street beggars scowling upon mendicants of a better stamp, whom despair alone had driven forth into the night for charity; feeble and ghastly invalids, upon whom death had placed a sure hand, and who sidled and tottered through the mob, looking every one beseechingly in the face, as if in search of some chance consolation, some lost hope; modest young girls returning from long and late labor to a cheerless home, and shrinking more tearfully than indignantly from the glances of ruffians, whose direct contact, even, could not be avoided; women of the town of all kinds and of all ages–the unequivocal beauty in the prime of her womanhood, putting one in mind of the statue in Lucian, with the surface of Parian marble, and the interior filled with filth–the loathsome and utterly lost leper in rags–the wrinkled, bejewelled, and paint-begrimed beldame, making a last effort at youth–the mere child of immature form, yet, from long association, an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her trade, and burning with a rabid ambition to be ranked the equal of her elders in vice; drunkards innumerable and indescribable–some in shreds and patches, reeling, inarticulate, with bruised visage and lack-lustre eyes–some in whole although filthy garments, with a slightly unsteady swagger, thick sensual lips, and hearty-looking rubicund faces–others clothed in materials which had once been good, and which even now were scrupulously well brushed-men who walked with a more than naturally firm and springy step, but whose countenances were fearfully pale, and whose eyes were hideously wild and red; and who clutched with quivering fingers, as they strode through the crowd, at every object which came within their reach; beside these, pic-men, porters, coal-heavers, sweeps; organ-grinders, monkey-exhibitors, and ballad-mongers, those who vended with those who sang; ragged artizans and exhausted laborers of every description, and all full of a noisy and inordinate vivacity which jarred discordantly upon the ear, and gave an aching sensation to the eye.|1|10|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
As the night deepened, so deepened to me the interest of the scene; for not only did the general character of the crowd materially alter (its gentler features retiring in the gradual withdrawal of the more orderly portion of the people, and its harsher ones coming out into bolder relief, as the late hour brought forth every species of infamy from its den), but the rays of the gas-lamps, feeble at first in their struggle with the dying day, had now at length gained ascendancy, and threw over every thing a fitful and garish lustre.|0|11|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
All was dark yet splendid–as that ebony to which has been likened the style of Tertullian.|1|11|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
The wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination of individual faces; and although the rapidity with which the world of light flitted before the window prevented me from casting more than a glance upon each visage, still it seemed that, in my then peculiar mental state, I could frequently read, even in that brief interval of a glance, the history of long years.|0|12|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
With my brow to the glass, I was thus occupied in scrutinizing the mob, when suddenly there came into view a countenance (that of a decrepid old man, some sixty-five or seventy years of age)–a countenance which at once arrested and absorbed my whole attention, on account of the absolute idiosyncrasy of its expression.|0|13|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Any thing even remotely resembling that expression I had never seen before.|1|13|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
I well remember that my first thought, upon beholding it, was that Retszch, had he viewed it, would have greatly preferred it to his own pictural incarnations of the fiend.|2|13|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
As I endeavored, during the brief minute of my original survey, to form some analysis of the meaning conveyed, there arose confusedly and paradoxically within my mind, the ideas of vast mental power, of caution, of penuriousness, of avarice, of coolness, of malice, of blood-thirstiness, of triumph, of merriment, of excessive terror, of intense–of supreme despair.|3|13|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
I felt singularly aroused, startled, fascinated.|4|13|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
"""How wild a history,"" I said to myself, ""is written within that bosom""!"|5|13|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Then came a craving desire to keep the man in view–to know more of him.|6|13|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Hurriedly putting on all overcoat, and seizing my hat and cane, I made my way into the street, and pushed through the crowd in the direction which I had seen him take; for he had already disappeared.|7|13|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
With some little difficulty I at length came within sight of him, approached, and followed him closely, yet cautiously, so as not to attract his attention.|8|13|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
I had now a good opportunity of examining his person.|0|14|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
He was short in stature, very thin, and apparently very feeble.|1|14|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
His clothes, generally, were filthy and ragged; but as he came, now and then, within the strong glare of a lamp, I perceived that his linen, although dirty, was of beautiful texture; and my vision deceived me, or, through a rent in a closely buttoned and evidently second-handed roquelaire which enveloped him, I caught a glimpse both of a diamond and of a dagger.|2|14|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
These observations heightened my curiosity, and I resolved to follow the stranger whithersoever he should go.|3|14|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
It was now fully night-fall, and a thick humid fog hung over the city, soon ending in a settled and heavy rain.|0|15|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
This change of weather had an odd effect upon the crowd, the whole of which was at once put into new commotion, and overshadowed by a world of umbrellas.|1|15|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
The waver, the jostle, and the hum increased in a tenfold degree.|2|15|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
For my own part I did not much regard the rain–the lurking of an old fever in my system rendering the moisture somewhat too dangerously pleasant.|3|15|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Tying a handkerchief about my mouth, I kept on.|4|15|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
For half an hour the old man held his way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare; and I here walked close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him.|5|15|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Never once turning his head to look back, he did not observe me.|6|15|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
By and by he passed into a cross street, which, although densely filled with people, was not quite so much thronged as the main one he had quitted.|7|15|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Here a change in his demeanor became evident.|8|15|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
He walked more slowly and with less object than before- more hesitatingly.|9|15|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
He crossed and re-crossed the way repeatedly, without apparent aim; and the press was still so thick, that, at every such movement, I was obliged to follow him closely.|10|15|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
The street was a narrow and long one, and his course lay within it for nearly an hour, during which the passengers had gradually diminished to about that number which is ordinarily seen at noon in Broadway near the park–so vast a difference is there between a London populace and that of the most frequented American city.|11|15|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
A second turn brought us into a square, brilliantly lighted, and overflowing with life.|12|15|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
The old manner of the stranger reappeared.|13|15|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
His chin fell upon his breast, while his eyes rolled wildly from under his knit brows, in every direction, upon those who hemmed him in.|14|15|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
He urged his way steadily and perseveringly.|15|15|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
I was surprised, however, to find, upon his having made the circuit of the square, that he turned and retraced his steps.|16|15|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Still more was I astonished to see him repeat the same walk several times–once nearly detecting me as he came around with a sudden movement.|17|15|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
In this exercise he spent another hour, at the end of which we met with far less interruption from passengers than at first.|0|16|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
The rain fell fast, the air grew cool; and the people were retiring to their homes.|1|16|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
With a gesture of impatience, the wanderer passed into a by-street comparatively deserted.|2|16|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Down this, some quarter of a mile long, he rushed with an activity I could not have dreamed of seeing in one so aged, and which put me to much trouble in pursuit.|3|16|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
A few minutes brought us to a large and busy bazaar, with the localities of which the stranger appeared well acquainted, and where his original demeanor again became apparent, as he forced his way to and fro, without aim, among the host of buyers and sellers.|4|16|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
During the hour and a half, or thereabouts, which we passed in this place, it required much caution on my part to keep him within reach without attracting his observation.|0|17|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Luckily I wore a pair of caoutchouc overshoes, and could move about in perfect silence.|1|17|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
At no moment did he see that I watched him.|2|17|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
He entered shop after shop, priced nothing, spoke no word, and looked at all objects with a wild and vacant stare.|3|17|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
I was now utterly amazed at his behavior, and firmly resolved that we should not part until I had satisfied myself in some measure respecting him.|4|17|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
A loud-toned clock struck eleven, and the company were fast deserting the bazaar.|0|18|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
A shop-keeper, in putting up a shutter, jostled the old man, and at the instant I saw a strong shudder come over his frame.|1|18|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
He hurried into the street, looked anxiously around him for an instant, and then ran with incredible swiftness through many crooked and peopleless lanes, until we emerged once more upon the great thoroughfare whence we had started–the street of the D---Hotel.|2|18|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
It no longer wore, however, the same aspect.|3|18|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
It was still brilliant with gas; but the rain fell fiercely, and there were few persons to be seen.|4|18|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
The stranger grew pale.|5|18|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
He walked moodily some paces up the once populous avenue, then, with a heavy sigh, turned in the direction of the river, and, plunging through a great variety of devious ways, came out, at length, in view of one of the principal theatres.|6|18|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
It was about being closed, and the audience were thronging from the doors.|7|18|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
I saw the old man gasp as if for breath while he threw himself amid the crowd; but I thought that the intense agony of his countenance had, in some measure, abated.|8|18|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
His head again fell upon his breast; he appeared as I had seen him at first.|9|18|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
I observed that he now took the course in which had gone the greater number of the audience but, upon the whole, I was at a loss to comprehend the waywardness of his actions.|10|18|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
As he proceeded, the company grew more scattered, and his old uneasiness and vacillation were resumed.|0|19|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
For some time he followed closely a party of some ten or twelve roisterers; but from this number one by one dropped off, until three only remained together, in a narrow and gloomy lane, little frequented.|1|19|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
The stranger paused, and, for a moment, seemed lost in thought; then, with every mark of agitation, pursued rapidly a route which brought us to the verge of the city, amid regions very different from those we had hitherto traversed.|2|19|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
It was the most noisome quarter of London, where every thing wore the worst impress of the most deplorable poverty, and of the most desperate crime.|3|19|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
By the dim light of an accidental lamp, tall, antique, worm-eaten, wooden tenements were seen tottering to their fall, in directions so many and capricious, that scarce the semblance of a passage was discernible between them.|4|19|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
The paving-stones lay at random, displaced from their beds by the rankly-growing grass.|5|19|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Horrible filth festered in the dammed-up gutters.|6|19|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
The whole atmosphere teemed with desolation.|7|19|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Yet, as we proceeded, the sounds of human life revived by sure degrees, and at length large bands of the most abandoned of a London populace were seen reeling to and fro.|8|19|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
The spirits of the old man again flickered up, as a lamp which is near its death-hour.|9|19|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Once more he strode onward with elastic tread.|10|19|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Suddenly a corner was turned, a blaze of light burst upon our sight, and we stood before one of the huge suburban temples of Intemperance–one of the palaces of the fiend, Gin.|11|19|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
It was now nearly daybreak; but a number of wretched inebriates still pressed in and out of the flaunting entrance.|0|20|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
With a half shriek of joy the old man forced a passage within, resumed at once his original bearing, and stalked backward and forward, without apparent object, among the throng.|1|20|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
He had not been thus long occupied, however, before a rush to the doors gave token that the host was closing them for the night.|2|20|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
It was something even more intense than despair that I then observed upon the countenance of the singular being whom I had watched so pertinaciously.|3|20|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Yet he did not hesitate in his career, but, with a mad energy, retraced his steps at once, to the heart of the mighty London.|4|20|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
Long and swiftly he fled, while I followed him in the wildest amazement, resolute not to abandon a scrutiny in which I now felt an interest all-absorbing.|5|20|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
The sun arose while we proceeded, and, when we had once again reached that most thronged mart of the populous town, the street of the D-–Hotel, it presented an appearance of human bustle and activity scarcely inferior to what I had seen on the evening before.|6|20|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
And here, long, amid the momently increasing confusion, did I persist in my pursuit of the stranger.|7|20|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
But, as usual, he walked to and fro, and during the day did not pass from out the turmoil of that street.|8|20|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
And, as the shades of the second evening came on, I grew wearied unto death, and, stopping fully in front of the wanderer, gazed at him steadfastly in the face.|9|20|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
He noticed me not, but resumed his solemn walk, while I, ceasing to follow, remained absorbed in contemplation.|10|20|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
"""The old man,"" I said at length, ""is the type and the genius of deep crime."|11|20|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
He refuses to be alone.|12|20|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
He is the man of the crowd.|13|20|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
It will be in vain to follow, for I shall learn no more of him, nor of his deeds.|14|20|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror
"The worst heart of the world is a grosser book than the 'Hortulus Animae,'* and perhaps it is but one of the great mercies of God that ""er lasst sich nicht lesen""."|15|20|The Man Of The Crowd|December 1840|Horror

--SIR THOMAS BROWNE, Urn-Burial.|1|0|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
THE mental features discoursed of as the analytical, are, in themselves, but little susceptible of analysis.|0|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
We appreciate them only in their effects.|1|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
We know of them, among other things, that they are always to their possessor, when inordinately possessed, a source of the liveliest enjoyment.|2|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
As the strong man exults in his physical ability, delighting in such exercises as call his muscles into action, so glories the analyst in that moral activity which disentangles.|3|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He derives pleasure from even the most trivial occupations bringing his talents into play.|4|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He is fond of enigmas, of conundrums, of hieroglyphics; exhibiting in his solutions of each a degree of acumen which appears to the ordinary apprehension preternatural.|5|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
His results, brought about by the very soul and essence of method, have, in truth, the whole air of intuition.|6|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The faculty of re-solution is possibly much invigorated by mathematical study, and especially by that highest branch of it which, unjustly, and merely on account of its retrograde operations, has been called, as if par excellence, analysis.|7|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Yet to calculate is not in itself to analyze.|8|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
A chess-player, for example, does the one without effort at the other.|9|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It follows that the game of chess, in its effects upon mental character, is greatly misunderstood.|10|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I am not now writing a treatise, but simply prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations very much at random; I will, therefore, take occasion to assert that the higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully tasked by the unostentatious game of draughts than by all the elaborate frivolity of chess.|11|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
In this latter, where the pieces have different and bizarre motions, with various and variable values, what is only complex is mistaken (a not unusual error) for what is profound.|12|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The attention is here called powerfully into play.|13|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
If it flag for an instant, an oversight is committed, resulting in injury or defeat.|14|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The possible moves being not only manifold but involute, the chances of such oversights are multiplied; and in nine cases out of ten it is the more concentrative rather than the more acute player who conquers.|15|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
In draughts, on the contrary, where the moves are unique and have but little variation, the probabilities of inadvertence are diminished, and the mere attention being left comparatively what advantages are obtained by either party are obtained by superior acumen.|16|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
To be less abstract --Let us suppose a game of draughts where the pieces are reduced to four kings, and where, of course, no oversight is to be expected.|17|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It is obvious that here the victory can be decided (the players being at all equal) only by some recherche movement, the result of some strong exertion of the intellect.|18|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Deprived of ordinary resources, the analyst throws himself into the spirit of his opponent, identifies himself therewith, and not unfrequently sees thus, at a glance, the sole methods (sometimes indeed absurdly simple ones) by which he may seduce into error or hurry into miscalculation.|19|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Whist has long been noted for its influence upon what is termed the calculating power; and men of the highest order of intellect have been known to take an apparently unaccountable delight in it, while eschewing chess as frivolous.|0|2|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Beyond doubt there is nothing of a similar nature so greatly tasking the faculty of analysis.|1|2|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The best chess-player in Christendom may be little more than the best player of chess; but proficiency in whist implies capacity for success in all these more important undertakings where mind struggles with mind.|2|2|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
When I say proficiency, I mean that perfection in the game which includes a comprehension of all the sources whence legitimate advantage may be derived.|3|2|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
These are not only manifold but multiform, and lie frequently among recesses of thought altogether inaccessible to the ordinary understanding.|4|2|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
To observe attentively is to remember distinctly; and, so far, the concentrative chess-player will do very well at whist; while the rules of Hoyle (themselves based upon the mere mechanism of the game) are sufficiently and generally comprehensible.|5|2|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"Thus to have a retentive memory, and to proceed by ""the book,"" are points commonly regarded as the sum total of good playing."|6|2|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
But it is in matters beyond the limits of mere rule that the skill of the analyst is evinced.|7|2|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He makes, in silence, a host of observations and inferences.|8|2|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
So, perhaps, do his companions; and the difference in the extent of the information obtained, lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation.|9|2|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The necessary knowledge is that of what to observe.|10|2|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Our player confines himself not at all; nor, because the game is the object, does he reject deductions from things external to the game.|11|2|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He examines the countenance of his partner, comparing it carefully with that of each of his opponents.|12|2|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He considers the mode of assorting the cards in each hand; often counting trump by trump, and honor by honor, through the glances bestowed by their holders upon each.|13|2|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He notes every variation of face as the play progresses, gathering a fund of thought from the differences in the expression of certainty, of surprise, of triumph, or chagrin.|14|2|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
From the manner of gathering up a trick he judges whether the person taking it can make another in the suit.|15|2|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He recognizes what is played through feint, by the air with which it is thrown upon the table.|16|2|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
A casual or inadvertent word; the accidental dropping or turning of a card, with the accompanying anxiety or carelessness in regard to its concealment; the counting of the tricks, with the order of their arrangement; embarrassment, hesitation, eagerness or trepidation --all afford, to his apparently intuitive perception, indications of the true state of affairs.|17|2|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The first two or three rounds having been played, he is in full possession of the contents of each hand, and thenceforward puts down his cards with as absolute a precision of purpose as if the rest of the party had turned outward the faces of their own.|18|2|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The analytical power should not be confounded with simple ingenuity; for while the analyst is necessarily ingenious, the ingenious man often remarkably incapable of analysis.|0|3|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The constructive or combining power, by which ingenuity is usually manifested, and which the phrenologists (I believe erroneously) have assigned a separate organ, supposing it a primitive faculty, has been so frequently seen in those whose intellect bordered otherwise upon idiocy, as to have attracted general observation among writers on morals.|1|3|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Between ingenuity and the analytic ability there exists a difference far greater, indeed, than that between the fancy and the imagination, but of a character very strictly analogous.|2|3|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It will found, in fact, that the ingenious are always fanciful, and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic.|3|3|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The narrative which follows will appear to the reader somewhat in the light of a commentary upon the propositions just advanced.|0|4|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Residing in Paris during the spring and part of the summer of 18--, I there became acquainted with a Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin.|0|5|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
This young gentleman was of an excellent --indeed of an illustrious family, but, by a variety of untoward events, had been reduced to such poverty that the energy of his character succumbed beneath it, and he ceased to bestir himself in the world, or to care for the retrieval of his fortunes.|1|5|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
By courtesy of his creditors, there still remained in his possession a small remnant of his patrimony; and, upon the income arising from this, he managed, by means of a rigorous economy, to procure the necessaries of life, without troubling himself about its superfluities.|2|5|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Books, indeed, were his sole luxuries, and in Paris these are easily obtained.|3|5|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Our first meeting was at an obscure library in the Rue Montmartre, where the accident of our both being in search of the same very rare and very remarkable volume, brought us into closer communion.|0|6|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
We saw each other again and again.|1|6|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I was deeply interested in the little family history which he detailed to me with all that candor which a Frenchman indulges whenever mere self is the theme.|2|6|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I was astonished, too, at the vast extent of his reading; and, above all, I felt my soul enkindled within me by the wild fervor, and the vivid freshness of his imagination.|3|6|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Seeking in Paris the objects I then sought, I felt that the society of such a man would be to me a treasure beyond price; and this feeling I frankly confided to him.|4|6|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It was at length arranged that we should live together during my stay in the city; and as my worldly circumstances were somewhat less embarrassed than his own, I was permitted to be at the expense of renting, and furnishing in a style which suited the rather fantastic gloom of our common temper, a time-eaten and grotesque mansion, long deserted through superstitions into which we did not inquire, and tottering to its fall in a retired and desolate portion of the Faubourg St. Germain.|5|6|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Had the routine of our life at this place been known to the world, we should have been regarded as madmen --although, perhaps, as madmen of a harmless nature.|0|7|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Our seclusion was perfect.|1|7|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
We admitted no visitors.|2|7|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Indeed the locality of our retirement had been carefully kept a secret from my own former associates; and it had been many years since Dupin had ceased to know or be known in Paris.|3|7|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
We existed within ourselves alone.|4|7|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It was a freak of fancy in my friend (for what else shall I call it?|0|8|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
) to be enamored of the Night for her own sake; and into this bizarrerie, as into all his others, I quietly fell; giving myself up to his wild whims with a perfect abandon.|1|8|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The sable divinity would not herself dwell with us always; but we could counterfeit her presence.|2|8|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
At the first dawn of the morning we closed all the massy shutters of our old building; lighted a couple of tapers which, strongly perfumed, threw out only the ghastliest and feeblest of rays.|3|8|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
By the aid of these we then busied our souls in dreams --reading, writing, or conversing, until warned by the clock of the advent of the true Darkness.|4|8|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Then we sallied forth into the streets, arm and arm, continuing the topics of the day, or roaming far and wide until a late hour, seeking, amid the wild lights and shadows of the populous city, that infinity of mental excitement which quiet observation can afford.|5|8|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
At such times I could not help remarking and admiring (although from his rich ideality I had been prepared to expect it) a peculiar analytic ability in Dupin.|0|9|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He seemed, too, to take an eager delight in its exercise --if not exactly in its display --and did not hesitate to confess the pleasure thus derived.|1|9|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He boasted to me, with a low chuckling laugh, that most men, in respect to himself, wore windows in their bosoms, and was wont to follow up such assertions by direct and very startling proofs of his intimate knowledge of my own.|2|9|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
His manner at these moments was frigid and abstract; his eyes were vacant in expression; while his voice, usually a rich tenor, rose into a treble which would have sounded petulantly but for the deliberateness and entire distinctness of the enunciation.|3|9|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Observing him in these moods, I often dwelt meditatively upon the old philosophy of the Bi-Part Soul, and amused myself with the fancy of a double Dupin --the creative and the resolvent.|4|9|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Let it not be supposed, from what I have just said, that I am detailing any mystery, or penning any romance.|0|10|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
What I have described in the Frenchman, was merely the result of an excited, or perhaps of a diseased intelligence.|1|10|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
But of the character of his remarks at the periods in question an example will best convey the idea.|2|10|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
We were strolling one night down a long dirty street, in the vicinity of the Palais Royal.|0|11|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Being both, apparently, occupied with thought, neither of us had spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at least.|1|11|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""He is a very little fellow, that's true, and would do better for the Theatre des Varietes""."|0|12|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""There can be no doubt of that,"" I replied unwittingly, and not at first observing (so much had I been absorbed in reflection) the extraordinary manner in which the speaker had chimed in with my meditations."|0|13|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
In an instant afterward I recollected myself, and my astonishment was profound.|1|13|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""Dupin,"" said I, gravely, ""this is beyond my comprehension."|0|14|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I do not hesitate to say that I am amazed, and can scarcely credit my senses.|1|14|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"How was it possible you should know I was thinking of --""?"|2|14|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Here I paused, to ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really knew of whom I thought.|3|14|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"--""of Chantilly,"" said he, ""why do you pause?"|0|15|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"You were remarking to yourself that his diminutive figure unfitted him for tragedy""."|1|15|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
This was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections.|0|16|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Chantilly was a quondam cobbler of the Rue St. Denis, who, becoming stage-mad, had attempted the role of Xerxes, in Crebillon's tragedy so called, and been notoriously Pasquinaded for his pains.|1|16|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""Tell me, for Heaven's sake,"" I exclaimed, ""the method --if method there is --by which you have been enabled to fathom my soul in this matter""."|0|17|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
In fact I was even more startled than I would have been willing to express.|1|17|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""It was the fruiterer,"" replied my friend, ""who brought you to the conclusion that the mender of soles was not of sufficient height for Xerxes et id genus omne""."|0|18|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""The fruiterer!"|0|19|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"--you astonish me --I know no fruiterer whomsoever""."|1|19|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""The man who ran up against you as we entered the street --it may have been fifteen minutes ago""."|0|20|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I now remembered that, in fact, a fruiterer, carrying upon his head a large basket of apples, had nearly thrown me down, by accident, as we passed from the Rue C-–into the thoroughfare where we stood; but what this had to do with Chantilly I could not possibly understand.|0|21|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
There was not a particle of charlatanerie about Dupin.|0|22|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""I will explain,"" he said, ""and that you may comprehend all clearly, we will explain,"" he said, ""and that you may comprehend all clearly, we will first retrace the course of your meditations, from the moment in which I spoke to you until that of the rencontre with the fruiterer in question."|1|22|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"The larger links of the chain run thus --Chantilly, Orion, Dr. Nichols, Epicurus, Stereotomy, the street stones, the fruiterer""."|2|22|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
There are few persons who have not, at some period of their lives, amused themselves in retracing the steps by which particular conclusions of their own minds have been attained.|0|23|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The occupation is often full of interest; and he who attempts it for the first time is astonished by the apparently illimitable distance and incoherence between the starting-point and the goal.|1|23|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
What, then, must have been my amazement when I heard the Frenchman speak what he had just spoken, and when I could not help acknowledging that he had spoken the truth.|2|23|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""We had been talking of horses, if I remember aright, just before leaving the Rue C--."|0|24|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
This was the last subject we discussed.|1|24|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
As we crossed into this street, a fruiterer, with a large basket upon his head, brushing quickly past us, thrust you upon a pile of paving-stones collected at a spot where the causeway is undergoing repair.|2|24|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
You stepped upon one of the loose fragments) slipped, slightly strained your ankle, appeared vexed or sulky, muttered a few words, turned to look at the pile, and then proceeded in silence.|3|24|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I was not particularly attentive to what you did; but observation has become with me, of late, a species of necessity.|4|24|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""You kept your eyes upon the ground --glancing, with a petulant expression, at the holes and ruts in the pavement, (so that I saw you were still thinking of the stones,) until we reached the little alley called Lamartine, which has been paved, by way of experiment, with the overlapping and riveted blocks."|0|25|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Here your countenance brightened up, and, perceiving your lips move, I could not doubt that you murmured the word 'stereotomy,' a term very affectedly applied to this species of pavement.|1|25|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I knew that you could not say to yourself 'stereotomy' without being brought to think of atomies, and thus of the theories of Epicurus; and since, when we discussed this subject not very long ago, I mentioned to you how singularly, yet with how little notice, the vague guesses of that noble Greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular cosmogony, I felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to the great nebula in Orion, and I certainly expected that you would do so.|2|25|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
You did look up; and I was now assured that I had correctly followed your steps.|3|25|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
But in that bitter tirade upon Chantilly, which appeared in yesterday's 'Musee,' the satirist, making some disgraceful allusions to the cobbler's change of name upon assuming the buskin, quoted a Latin line about which we have often conversed.|4|25|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Perdidit antiquum litera prima sonum.|0|26|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I had told you that this was in reference to Orion, formerly written Urion; and, from certain pungencies connected with this explanation, I was aware that you could not have forgotten it.|0|27|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It was clear, therefore, that you would not fall to combine the ideas of Orion and Chantilly.|1|27|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
That you did combine them I say by the character of the smile which passed over your lips.|2|27|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
You thought of the poor cobbler's immolation.|3|27|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
So far, you had been stooping in your gait; but now I saw you draw yourself up to your full height.|4|27|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I was then sure that you reflected upon the diminutive figure of Chantilly.|5|27|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction

There were several deep scratches just below the chin, together with a series of livid spots which were evidently the impression of fingers.|5|49|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The face was fearfully discolored, and the eye-balls protruded.|6|49|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The tongue had been partially bitten through.|7|49|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
A large bruise was discovered upon the pit of the stomach, produced, apparently, by the pressure of a knee.|8|49|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
In the opinion of M. Dumas, Mademoiselle L'Espanaye had been throttled to death by some person or persons unknown.|9|49|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The corpse of the mother was horribly mutilated.|10|49|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
All the bones of the right leg and arm were more or less shattered.|11|49|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The left tibia much splintered, as well as all the ribs of the left side.|12|49|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Whole body dreadfully bruised and discolored.|13|49|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It was not possible to say how the injuries had been inflicted.|14|49|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
A heavy club of wood, or a broad bar of iron --a chair --any large, heavy, and obtuse weapon have produced such results, if wielded by the hands of a very powerful man.|15|49|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
No woman could have inflicted the blows with any weapon.|16|49|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The head of the deceased, when seen by witness, was entirely separated from the body, and was also greatly shattered.|17|49|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The throat had evidently been cut with some very sharp instrument --probably with a razor.|18|49|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""Alexandre Etienne, surgeon, was called with M. Dumas to view the bodies."|0|50|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Corroborated the testimony, and the opinions of M. Dumas.|1|50|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""Nothing farther of importance was elicited, although several other persons were examined."|0|51|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
A murder so mysterious, and so perplexing in all its particulars, was never before committed in Paris --if indeed a murder has been committed at all.|1|51|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The police are entirely at fault --an unusual occurrence in affairs of this nature.|2|51|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"There is not, however, the shadow of a clew apparent""."|3|51|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The evening edition of the paper stated that the greatest excitement continued in the Quartier St. Roch --that the premises in question had been carefully re-searched, and fresh examinations of witnesses instituted, but all to no purpose.|0|52|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
A postscript, however mentioned that Adolphe Le Bon had been arrested and imprisoned --although nothing appeared to criminate him, beyond the facts already detailed.|1|52|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Dupin seemed singularly interested in the progress of this affair --at least so I judged from his manner, for he made no comments.|0|53|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It was only after the announcement that Le Bon had been imprisoned, that he asked me my opinion respecting the murders.|1|53|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I could merely agree with all Paris in considering them an insoluble mystery.|0|54|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I saw no means by which it would be possible to trace the murderer.|1|54|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""We must not judge of the means,"" said Dupin, ""by this shell of an examination."|0|55|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The Parisian police, so much extolled for acumen, are cunning, but no more.|1|55|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
There is no method in their proceedings, beyond the method of the moment.|2|55|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
They make a vast parade of measures; but, not unfrequently, these are so ill adapted to the objects proposed, as to put us in mind of Monsieur Jourdain's calling for his robe-de-chambre --pour mieux entendre la musique.|3|55|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The results attained by them are not unfrequently surprising, but, for the most part, are brought about by simple diligence and activity.|4|55|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
When these qualities are unavailing, their schemes fall.|5|55|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Vidocq, for example, was a good guesser, and a persevering man.|6|55|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
But, without educated thought, he erred continually by the very intensity of his investigations.|7|55|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He impaired his vision by holding the object too close.|8|55|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He might see, perhaps, one or two points with unusual clearness, but in so doing he, necessarily, lost sight of the matter as a whole.|9|55|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Thus there is such a thing as being too profound.|10|55|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Truth is not always in a well.|11|55|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
In fact, as regards the more important knowledge, I do believe that she is invariably superficial.|12|55|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The depth lies in the valleys where we seek her, and not upon the mountain-tops where she is found.|13|55|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The modes and sources of this kind of error are well typified in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies.|14|55|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
To look at a star by glances --to view it in a side-long way, by turning toward it the exterior portions of the retina (more susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the interior), is to behold the star distinctly --is to have the best appreciation of its lustre --a lustre which grows dim just in proportion as we turn our vision fully upon it.|15|55|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
A greater number of rays actually fall upon the eye in the latter case, but, in the former, there is the more refined capacity for comprehension.|16|55|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
By undue profundity we perplex and enfeeble thought; and it is possible to make even Venus herself vanish from the firmament by a scrutiny too sustained, too concentrated, or too direct.|17|55|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""As for these murders, let us enter into some examinations for ourselves, before we make up an opinion respecting them."|0|56|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"An inquiry will afford us amusement,"" (I thought this an odd term, so applied, but said nothing) ""and, besides, Le Bon once rendered me a service for which I am not ungrateful."|1|56|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
We will go and see the premises with our own eyes.|2|56|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"I know G--, the Prefect of Police, and shall have no difficulty in obtaining the necessary permission""."|3|56|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The permission was obtained, and we proceeded at once to the Rue Morgue.|0|57|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
This is one of those miserable thoroughfares which intervene between the Rue Richelieu and the Rue St. Roch.|1|57|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It was late in the afternoon when we reached it; as this quarter is at a great distance from that in which we resided.|2|57|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The house was readily found; for there were still many persons gazing up at the closed shutters, with an objectless curiosity, from the opposite side of the way.|3|57|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It was an ordinary Parisian house, with a gateway, on one side of which was a glazed watch-box, with a sliding way, on one si panel in the window, indicating a loge de concierge.|4|57|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Before going in we walked up the street, turned down an alley, and then, again turning, passed in the rear of the building-Dupin, meanwhile, examining the whole neighborhood, as well as the house, with a minuteness of attention for which I could see no possible object.|5|57|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Retracing our steps, we came again to the front of the dwelling, rang, and, having shown our credentials, were admitted by the agents in charge.|0|58|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
We went up stairs --into the chamber where the body of Mademoiselle L'Espanaye had been found, and where both the deceased still lay.|1|58|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The disorders of the room had, as usual, been suffered to exist.|2|58|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"I saw nothing beyond what had been stated in the ""Gazette des Tribunaux""."|3|58|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Dupin scrutinized every thing-not excepting the bodies of the victims.|4|58|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
We then went into the other rooms, and into the yard; a gendarme accompanying us throughout.|5|58|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The examination occupied us until dark, when we took our departure.|6|58|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
On our way home my companion stopped in for a moment at the office of one of the dally papers.|7|58|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I have said that the whims of my friend were manifold, and that Fe les menageais: --for this phrase there is no English equivalent.|0|59|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It was his humor, now, to decline all conversation on the subject of the murder, until about noon the next day.|1|59|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He then asked me, suddenly, if I had observed any thing peculiar at the scene of the atrocity.|2|59|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"There was something in his manner of emphasizing the word ""peculiar,"" which caused me to shudder, without knowing why."|0|60|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""No, nothing peculiar,"" I said; ""nothing more, at least, than we both saw stated in the paper""."|0|61|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""The 'Gazette,'"" he replied, ""has not entered, I fear, into the unusual horror of the thing."|0|62|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
But dismiss the idle opinions of this print.|1|62|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It appears to me that this mystery is considered insoluble, for the very reason which should cause it to be regarded as easy of solution --I mean for the outre character of its features.|2|62|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The police are confounded by the seeming absence of motive --not for the murder itself --but for the atrocity of the murder.|3|62|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
They are puzzled, too, by the seeming impossibility of reconciling the voices heard in contention, with the facts that no one was discovered up stairs but the assassinated Mademoiselle L'Espanaye, and that there were no means of egress without the notice of the party ascending.|4|62|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The wild disorder of the room; the corpse thrust, with the head downward, up the chimney; the frightful mutilation of the body of the old lady; these considerations with those just mentioned, and others which I need not mention, have sufficed to paralyze the powers, by putting completely at fault the boasted acumen, of the government agents.|5|62|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
They have fAllan into the gross but common error of confounding the unusual with the abstruse.|6|62|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
But it is by these deviations from the plane of the ordinary, that reason feels its way, if at all, in its search for the true.|7|62|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
In investigations such as we are now pursuing, it should not be so much asked 'what has occurred,' as 'what has occurred that has never occurred before.|8|62|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"' In fact, the facility with which I shall arrive, or have arrived, at the solution of this mystery, is in the direct ratio of its apparent insolubility in the eyes of the police""."|9|62|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I stared at the speaker in mute astonishment.|0|63|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""I am now awaiting,"" continued he, looking toward the door of our apartment --""I am now awaiting a person who, although perhaps not the perpetrator of these butcheries, must have been in some measure implicated in their perpetration."|0|64|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Of the worst portion of the crimes committed, it is probable that he is innocent.|1|64|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I hope that I am right in this supposition; for upon it I build my expectation of reading the entire riddle.|2|64|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I look for the man here --in this room --every moment.|3|64|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It is true that he may not arrive; but the probability is that he will.|4|64|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Should he come, it will be necessary to detain him.|5|64|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"Here are pistols; and we both know how to use them when occasion demands their use""."|6|64|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I took the pistols, scarcely knowing what I did, or believing what I heard, while Dupin went on, very much as if in a soliloquy.|0|65|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I have already spoken of his abstract manner at such times.|1|65|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
His discourse was addressed to myself; but his voice, although by no means loud, had that intonation which is commonly employed in speaking to some one at a great distance.|2|65|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
His eyes, vacant in expression, regarded only the wall.|3|65|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""That the voices heard in contention,"" he said, ""by the party upon the stairs, were not the voices of the women themselves, was fully proved by the evidence."|0|66|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
This relieves us of all doubt upon the question whether the old lady could have first destroyed the daughter, and afterward have committed suicide.|1|66|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I speak of this point chiefly for the sake of method; for the strength of Madame L'Espanaye would have been utterly unequal to the task of thrusting her daughter's corpse up the chimney as it was found; and the nature of the wounds upon her own person entirely preclude the idea of self-destruction.|2|66|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Murder, then, has been committed by some third party; and the voices of this third party were those heard in contention.|3|66|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Let me now advert --not to the whole testimony respecting these voices --but to what was peculiar in that testimony.|4|66|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"Did you observe anything peculiar about it""?"|5|66|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I remarked that, while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the gruff voice to be that of a Frenchman, there was much disagreement in regard to the shrill, or, as one individual termed it, the harsh voice.|0|67|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""That was the evidence itself,"" said Dupin, ""but it was not the peculiarity of the evidence."|0|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
You have observed nothing distinctive.|1|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Yet there was something to be observed.|2|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The witnesses, as you remark, agreed about the gruff voice; they were here unanimous.|3|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
But in regard to the shrill voice, the peculiarity is not that they disagreed --but that, while an Italian, an Englishman, a Spaniard, a Hollander, and a Frenchman attempted to describe it, each one spoke of it as that of a foreigner.|4|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Each is sure that it was not the voice of one of his own countrymen.|5|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Each likens it --not to the voice of an individual of any nation with whose language he is conversant --but the converse.|6|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The Frenchman supposes it the voice of a Spaniard, and 'might have distinguished some words had he been acquainted with the Spanish.|7|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
' The Dutchman maintains it to have been that of a Frenchman; but we find it stated that 'not understanding French this witness was examined through an interpreter.|8|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
' The Englishman thinks it the voice of a German, and 'does not understand German.|9|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
' The Spaniard 'is sure' that it was that of an Englishman, but 'judges by the intonation' altogether, 'as he has no knowledge of the English.|10|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
' The Italian believes it the voice of a Russian, but 'has never conversed with a native of Russia.|11|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
' A second Frenchman differs, moreover, with the first, and is positive that the voice was that of an Italian; but, not being cognizant of that tongue, is, like the Spaniard, 'convinced by the intonation.|12|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
' Now, how strangely unusual must that voice have really been, about which such testimony as this could have been elicited!|13|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
--in whose tones, even, denizens of the five great divisions of Europe could recognise nothing familiar!|14|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
You will say that it might have been the voice of an Asiatic --of an African.|15|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Neither Asiatics nor Africans abound in Paris; but, without denying the inference, I will now merely call your attention to three points.|16|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The voice is termed by one witness 'harsh rather than shrill.|17|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
' It is represented by two others to have been 'quick and unequal' No words --no sounds resembling words --were by any witness mentioned as distinguishable.|18|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""I know not,"" continued Dupin, ""what impression I may have made, so far, upon your own understanding; but I do not hesitate to say that legitimate deductions even from this portion of the testimony --the portion respecting the gruff and shrill voices --are in themselves sufficient to engender a suspicion which should give direction to all farther progress in the investigation of the mystery."|0|69|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I said 'legitimate deductions;' but my meaning is not thus fully expressed.|1|69|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I designed to imply that the deductions are the sole proper ones, and that the suspicion arises inevitably from them as the single result.|2|69|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
What the suspicion is, however, I will not say just yet.|3|69|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I merely wish you to bear in mind that, with myself, it was sufficiently forcible to give a definite form --a certain tendency --to my inquiries in the chamber.|4|69|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""Let us now transport ourselves, in fancy, to this chamber."|0|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
What shall we first seek here?|1|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The means of egress employed by the murderers.|2|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It is not too much to say that neither of us believe in praeternatural events.|3|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Madame and Mademoiselle L'Espanaye were not destroyed by spirits.|4|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The doers of the deed were material, and escaped materially.|5|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Then how?|6|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Fortunately, there is but one mode of reasoning upon the point, and that mode must lead us to a definite decision.|7|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
--Let us examine, each by each, the possible means of egress.|8|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It is clear that the assassins were in the room where Mademoiselle L'Espanaye was found, or at least in the room adjoining, when the party ascended the stairs.|9|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It is then only from these two apartments that we have to seek issues.|10|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The police have laid bare the floors, the ceilings, and the masonry of the walls, in every direction.|11|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
No secret issues could have escaped their vigilance.|12|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
But, not trusting to their eyes, I examined with my own.|13|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
There were, then, no secret issues.|14|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Both doors leading from the rooms into the passage were securely locked, with the keys inside.|15|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Let us turn to the chimneys.|16|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
These, although of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet above the hearths, will not admit, throughout their extent, the body of a large cat.|17|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The impossibility of egress, by means already stated, being thus absolute, we are reduced to the windows.|18|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Through those of the front room no one could have escaped without notice from the crowd in the street.|19|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The murderers must have passed, then, through those of the back room.|20|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Now, brought to this conclusion in so unequivocal a manner as we are, it is not our part, as reasoners, to reject it on account of apparent impossibilities.|21|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It is only left for us to prove that these apparent 'impossibilities' are, in reality, not such.|22|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""There are two windows in the chamber."|0|71|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
One of them is unobstructed by furniture, and is wholly visible.|1|71|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The lower portion of the other is hidden from view by the head of the unwieldy bedstead which is thrust close up against it.|2|71|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The former was found securely fastened from within.|3|71|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It resisted the utmost force of those who endeavored to raise it.|4|71|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
A large gimlet-hole had been pierced in its frame to the left, and a very stout nail was found fitted therein, nearly to the head.|5|71|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Upon examining the other window, a similar nail was seen similarly fitted in it; and a vigorous attempt to raise this sash, failed also.|6|71|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The police were now entirely satisfied that egress had not been in these directions.|7|71|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
And, therefore, it was thought a matter of supererogation to withdraw the nails and open the windows.|8|71|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""My own examination was somewhat more particular, and was so for the reason I have just given --because here it was, I knew, that all apparent impossibilities must be proved to be not such in reality."|0|72|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""I proceeded to think thus --a posteriori."|0|73|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The murderers did escape from one of these windows.|1|73|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
This being so, they could not have re-fastened the sashes from the inside, as they were found fastened; --the consideration which put a stop, through its obviousness, to the scrutiny of the police in this quarter.|2|73|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Yet the sashes were fastened.|3|73|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
They must, then, have the power of fastening themselves.|4|73|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
There was no escape from this conclusion.|5|73|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I stepped to the unobstructed casement, withdrew the nail with some difficulty, and attempted to raise the sash.|6|73|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It resisted all my efforts, as I had anticipated.|7|73|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
A concealed spring must, I now knew, exist; and this corroboration of my idea convinced me that my premises, at least, were correct, however mysterious still appeared the circumstances attending the nails.|8|73|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
A careful search soon brought to light the hidden spring.|9|73|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I pressed it, and, satisfied with the discovery, forebore to upraise the sash.|10|73|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""I now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively."|0|74|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
A person passing out through this window might have reclosed it, and the spring would have caught --but the nail could not have been replaced.|1|74|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The conclusion was plain, and again narrowed in the field of my investigations.|2|74|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The assassins must have escaped through the other window.|3|74|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Supposing, then, the springs upon each sash to be the same, as was probable, there must be found a difference between the nails, or at least between the modes of their fixture.|4|74|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Getting upon the sacking of the bedstead, I looked over the headboard minutely at the second casement.|5|74|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Passing my hand down behind the board, I readily discovered and pressed the spring, which was, as I had supposed, identical in character with its neighbor.|6|74|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I now looked at the nail.|7|74|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It was as stout as the other, and apparently fitted in the same manner --driven in nearly up to the head.|8|74|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""You will say that I was puzzled; but, if you think so, you must have misunderstood the nature of the inductions."|0|75|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
To use a sporting phrase, I had not been once 'at fault.|1|75|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
' The scent had never for an instant been lost.|2|75|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
There was no flaw in any link of the chain.|3|75|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I had traced the secret to its ultimate result, --and that result was the nail.|4|75|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It had, I say, in every respect, the appearance of its fellow in the other window; but this fact was an absolute nullity (conclusive as it might seem to be) when compared with the consideration that here, at this point, terminated the clew.|5|75|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
'There must be something wrong,' I said, 'about the nail.|6|75|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
' I touched it; and the head, with about a quarter of an inch of the shank, came off in my fingers.|7|75|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The rest of the shank was in the gimlet-hole, where it had been broken off.|8|75|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The fracture was an old one (for its edges were incrusted with rust), and had apparently been accomplished by the blow of a hammer, which had partially imbedded, in the top of the bottom sash, the head portion of the nail.|9|75|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
now carefully replaced this head portion in the indentation whence I had taken it, and the resemblance to a perfect nail was complete-the fissure was invisible.|10|75|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Pressing the spring, I gently raised the sash for a few inches; the head went up with it, remaining firm in its bed.|11|75|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I closed the window, and the semblance of the whole nail was again perfect.|12|75|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""The riddle, so far, was now unriddled."|0|76|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The assassin had escaped through the window which looked upon the bed.|1|76|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Dropping of its own accord upon his exit (or perhaps purposely closed) it had become fastened by the spring; and it was the retention of this spring which had been mistaken by the police for that of the nail, --farther inquiry being thus considered unnecessary.|2|76|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""The next question is that of the mode of descent."|0|77|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Upon this point I had been satisfied in my walk with you around the building.|1|77|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
About five feet and a half from the casement in question there runs a lightning-rod.|2|77|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
From this rod it would have been impossible for any one to reach the window itself, to say nothing of entering it.|3|77|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I observed, however, that shutters of the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by Parisian carpenters ferrades --a kind rarely employed at the present day, but frequently seen upon very old mansions at Lyons and Bordeaux.|4|77|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
They are in the form of an ordinary door, (a single, not a folding door) except that the upper half is latticed or worked in open trellis --thus affording an excellent hold for the hands.|5|77|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
In the present instance these shutters are fully three feet and a half broad.|6|77|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
When we saw them from the rear of the house, they were both about half open --that is to say, they stood off at right angles from the wall.|7|77|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It is probable that the police, as well as myself, examined the back of the tenement; but, if so, in looking at these ferrades in the line of their breadth (as they must have done), they did not perceive this great breadth itself, or, at all events, failed to take it into due consideration.|8|77|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
In fact, having once satisfied themselves that no egress could have been made in this quarter, they would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination.|9|77|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It was clear to me, however, that the shutter belonging to the window at the head of the bed, would, if swung fully back to the wall, reach to within two feet of the lightning-rod.|10|77|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It was also evident that, by exertion of a very unusual degree of activity and courage, an entrance into the window, from the rod, might have been thus effected.|11|77|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
--By reaching to the distance of two feet and a half (we now suppose the shutter open to its whole extent) a robber might have taken a firm grasp upon the trellis-work.|12|77|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Letting go, then, his hold upon the rod, placing his feet securely against the wall, and springing boldly from it, he might have swung the shutter so as to close it, and, if we imagine the window open at the time, might have swung himself into the room.|13|77|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""I wish you to bear especially in mind that I have spoken of a very unusual degree of activity as requisite to success in so hazardous and so difficult a feat."|0|78|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It is my design to show you, first, that the thing might possibly have been accomplished: --but, secondly and chiefly, I wish to impress upon your understanding the very extraordinary --the almost praeternatural character of that agility which could have accomplished it.|1|78|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""You will say, no doubt, using the language of the law, that 'to make out my case' I should rather undervalue, than insist upon a full estimation of the activity required in this matter."|0|79|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
This may be the practice in law, but it is not the usage of reason.|1|79|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
My ultimate object is only the truth.|2|79|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"My immediate purpose is to lead you to place in juxta-position that very unusual activity of which I have just spoken, with that very peculiar shrill (or harsh) and unequal voice, about whose nationality no two persons could be found to agree, and in whose utterance no syllabification could be detected""."|3|79|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
At these words a vague and half-formed conception of the meaning of Dupin flitted over my mind.|0|80|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I seemed to be upon the verge of comprehension, without power to comprehend --as men, at times, find themselves upon the brink of remembrance, without being able, in the end, to remember.|1|80|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
My friend went on with his discourse.|2|80|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""You will see,"" he said, ""that I have shifted the question from the mode of egress to that of ingress."|0|81|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It was my design to suggest that both were effected in the same manner, at the same point.|1|81|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Let us now revert to the interior of the room.|2|81|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Let us survey the appearances here.|3|81|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The drawers of the bureau, it is said, had been rifled, although many articles of apparel still remained within them.|4|81|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The conclusion here is absurd.|5|81|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It is a mere guess --a very silly one --and no more.|6|81|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
How are we to know that the articles found in the drawers were not all these drawers had originally contained?|7|81|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter lived an exceedingly retired life --saw no company --seldom went out --had little use for numerous changes of habiliment.|8|81|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Those found were at least of as good quality as any likely to be possessed by these ladies.|9|81|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
If a thief had taken any, why did he not take the best --why did he not take all?|10|81|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
In a word, why did he abandon four thousand francs in gold to encumber himself with a bundle of linen?|11|81|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The gold was abandoned.|12|81|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Nearly the whole sum mentioned by Monsieur Mignaud, the banker, was discovered, in bags, upon the floor.|13|81|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I wish you, therefore, to discard from your thoughts the blundering idea of motive, engendered in the brains of the police by that portion of the evidence which speaks of money delivered at the door of the house.|14|81|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Coincidences ten times as remarkable as this (the delivery of the money, and murder committed within three days upon the party receiving it), happen to all of us every hour of our lives, without attracting even momentary notice.|15|81|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Coincidences, in general, are great stumbling-blocks in the way of that class of thinkers who have been educated to know nothing of the theory of probabilities --that theory to which the most glorious objects of human research are indebted for the most glorious of illustration.|16|81|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
In the present instance, had the gold been gone, the fact of its delivery three days before would have formed something more than a coincidence.|17|81|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It would have been corroborative of this idea of motive.|18|81|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
But, under the real circumstances of the case, if we are to suppose gold the motive of this outrage, we must also imagine the perpetrator so vacillating an idiot as to have abandoned his gold and his motive together.|19|81|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""Keeping now steadily in mind the points to which I have drawn your attention --that peculiar voice, that unusual agility, and that startling absence of motive in a murder so singularly atrocious as this --let us glance at the butchery itself."|0|82|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Here is a woman strangled to death by manual strength, and thrust up a chimney, head downward.|1|82|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Ordinary assassins employ no such modes of murder as this.|2|82|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Least of all, do they thus dispose of the murdered.|3|82|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
In the manner of thrusting the corpse up the chimney, you will that there was something excessively outre --something altogether irreconcilable with our common notions of human action, even when we suppose the actors the most depraved of men.|4|82|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Think, too, how great must have been that strength which could have thrust the body up such an aperture so forcibly that the united vigor of several persons was found barely sufficient to drag it down!|5|82|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""Turn, now, to other indications of the employment of a vigor most marvellous."|0|83|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
On the hearth were thick tresses --very thick tresses --of grey human hair.|1|83|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
These had been torn out by the roots.|2|83|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
You are aware of the great force necessary in tearing thus from the head even twenty or thirty hairs together.|3|83|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
You saw the locks in question as well as myself.|4|83|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Their roots (a hideous sight!|5|83|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
) were clotted with fragments of the flesh of the scalp --sure token of the prodigious power which had been exerted in uprooting perhaps half a million of hairs at a time.|6|83|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The throat of the old lady was not merely cut, but the head absolutely severed from the body: the instrument was a mere razor.|7|83|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I wish you also to look at the brutal ferocity of these deeds.|8|83|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Of the bruises upon the body of Madame L'Espanaye I do not speak.|9|83|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Monsieur Dumas, and his worthy coadjutor Monsieur Etienne, have pronounced that they were inflicted by some obtuse instrument; and so far these gentlemen are very correct.|10|83|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The obtuse instrument was clearly the stone pavement in the yard, upon which the victim had fAllan from the window which looked in upon the bed.|11|83|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
This idea, however simple it may now seem, escaped the police for the same reason that the breadth of the shutters escaped them --because, by the affair of the nails, their perceptions had been hermetically sealed against the possibility of the windows have ever been opened at all.|12|83|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
If now, in addition to all these things, you have properly reflected upon the odd disorder of the chamber, we have gone so far as to combine the ideas of an agility astounding, a strength superhuman, a ferocity brutal, a butchery without motive, a grotesquerie in horror absolutely alien from humanity, and a voice foreign in tone to the ears of men of many nations, and devoid of all distinct or intelligible syllabification.|0|84|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
What result, then, has ensued?|1|84|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"What impression have I made upon your fancy""?"|2|84|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I felt a creeping of the flesh as Dupin asked me the question.|0|85|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""A madman,"" I said, ""has done this deed --some raving maniac, escaped from a neighboring Maison de Sante""."|1|85|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""In some respects,"" he replied, ""your idea is not irrelevant."|0|86|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
But the voices of madmen, even in their wildest paroxysms, are never found to tally with that peculiar voice heard upon the stairs.|1|86|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Madmen are of some nation, and their language, however incoherent in its words, has always the coherence of syllabification.|2|86|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Besides, the hair of a madman is not such as I now hold in my hand.|3|86|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I disentangled this little tuft from the rigidly clutched fingers of Madame L'Espanaye.|4|86|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"Tell me what you can make of it""."|5|86|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""Dupin""!"|0|87|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"I said, completely unnerved; ""this hair is most unusual --this is no human hair""."|1|87|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""I have not asserted that it is,"" said he; ""but, before we decide this point, I wish you to glance at the little sketch I have here traced upon this paper."|0|88|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It is a fac-simile drawing of what has been described in one portion of the testimony as 'dark bruises, and deep indentations of finger nails,' upon the throat of Mademoiselle L'Espanaye, and in another, (by Messrs.|1|88|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Dumas and Etienne,) as a 'series of livid spots, evidently the impression of fingers.|2|88|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""You will perceive,"" continued my friend, spreading out the paper upon the table before us, ""that this drawing gives the idea of a firm and fixed hold."|0|89|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
There is no slipping apparent.|1|89|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Each finger has retained --possibly until the death of the victim --the fearful grasp by which it originally imbedded itself.|2|89|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"Attempt, now, to place all your fingers, at the same time, in the respective impressions as you see them""."|3|89|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I made the attempt in vain.|0|90|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""We are possibly not giving this matter a fair trial,"" he said."|0|91|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""The paper is spread out upon a plane surface; but the human throat is cylindrical."|1|91|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Here is a billet of wood, the circumference of which is about that of the throat.|2|91|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"Wrap the drawing around it, and try the experiment again""."|3|91|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I did so; but the difficulty was even more obvious than before.|0|92|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""This,"" I said, ""is the mark of no human hand""."|0|93|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""Read now,"" replied Dupin, ""this passage from Cuvier""."|0|94|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of the large fulvous Ourang-Outang of the East Indian Islands.|1|94|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The gigantic stature, the prodigious strength and activity, the wild ferocity, and the imitative propensities of these mammalia are sufficiently well known to all.|2|94|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I understood the full horrors of the murder at once.|3|94|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""The description of the digits,"" said I, as I made an end of reading, ""is in exact accordance with this drawing, I see that no animal but an Ourang-Outang, of the species here mentioned, could have impressed the indentations as you have traced them."|0|95|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
This tuft of tawny hair, too, is identical in character with that of the beast of Cuvier.|1|95|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
But I cannot possibly comprehend the particulars of this frightful mystery.|2|95|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"Besides, there were two voices heard in contention, and one of them was unquestionably the voice of a Frenchman""."|3|95|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
True; and you will remember an expression attributed almost unanimously, by the evidence, to this voice, --the expression, 'mon Dieu!|0|96|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
' This, under the circumstances, has been justly characterized by one of the witnesses (Montani, the confectioner,) as an expression of remonstrance or expostulation.|1|96|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Upon these two words, therefore, I have mainly built my hopes of a full solution of the riddle.|2|96|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
A Frenchman was cognizant of the murder.|3|96|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It is possible --indeed it is far more than probable --that he was innocent of all participation in the bloody transactions which took place.|4|96|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The Ourang-Outang may have escaped from him.|5|96|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He may have traced it to the chamber; but, under the agitating circumstances which ensued, he could never have re-captured it.|6|96|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It is still at large.|7|96|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I will not pursue these guesses-for I have no right to call them more --since the shades of reflection upon which they are based are scarcely of sufficient depth to be appreciable by my own intellect, and since I could not pretend to make them intelligible to the understanding of another.|8|96|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
We will call them guesses then, and speak of them as such.|9|96|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"If the Frenchman in question is indeed, as I suppose, innocent of this atrocity, this advertisement, which I left last night, upon our return home, at the office of 'Le Monde,' (a paper devoted to the shipping interest, and much sought by sailors,) will bring him to our residence""."|10|96|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Caught --In the Bois de Boulogne, early in the morning of the --inst.|0|98|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
, (the morning of the murder,) a very large, tawny Ourang-Outang of the Bornese species.|1|98|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The owner, (who is ascertained to be a sailor, belonging to a Maltese vessel,) may have the animal again, upon identifying it satisfactorily, and paying a few charges arising from its capture and keeping.|2|98|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Call at No.|3|98|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
--, Rue --, Faubourg St. Germain --au troisieme.|4|98|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""How was it possible,"" I asked, ""that you should know the man to be a sailor, and belonging to a Maltese vessel""?"|0|99|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""I do not know it,"" said Dupin."|0|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""I am not sure of it."|1|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Here, however, is a small piece of ribbon, which from its form, and from its greasy appearance, has evidently been used in tying the hair in one of those long queues of which sailors are so fond.|2|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Moreover, this knot is one which few besides sailors can tie, and is peculiar to the Maltese.|3|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I picked the ribbon up at the foot of the lightning-rod.|4|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It could not have belonged to either of the deceased.|5|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Now if, after all, I am wrong in my induction from this ribbon, that the Frenchman was a sailor belonging to a Maltese vessel, still I can have done no harm in saying what I did in the advertisement.|6|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
If I am in error, he will merely suppose that I have been misled by some circumstance into which he will not take the trouble to inquire.|7|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
But if I am right, a great point is gained.|8|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Cognizant although innocent of the murder, the Frenchman will naturally hesitate about replying to the advertisement --about demanding the Ourang-Outang.|9|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He will reason thus: --'I am innocent; I am poor; my Ourang-Outang is of great value --to one in my circumstances a fortune of itself --why should I lose it through idle apprehensions of danger?|10|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Here it is, within my grasp.|11|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It was found in the Bois de Boulogne --at a vast distance from the scene of that butchery.|12|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
How can it ever be suspected that a brute beast should have done the deed?|13|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The police are at fault --they have failed to procure the slightest clew.|14|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Should they even trace the animal, it would be impossible to prove me cognizant of the murder, or to implicate me in guilt on account of that cognizance.|15|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Above all, I am known.|16|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The advertiser designates me as the possessor of the beast.|17|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I am not sure to what limit his knowledge may extend.|18|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Should I avoid claiming a property of so great value, which it is known that I possess, I will render the animal, at least, liable to suspicion.|19|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It is not my policy to attract attention either to myself or to the beast.|20|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I will answer the advertisement, get the Ourang-Outang, and keep it close until this matter has blown over.|21|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
At this moment we heard a step upon the stairs.|0|101|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""Be ready,"" said Dupin, ""with your pistols, but neither use them nor show them until at a signal from myself""."|0|102|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The front door of the house had been left open, and the visitor had entered, without ringing, and advanced several steps upon the staircase.|0|103|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Now, however, he seemed to hesitate.|1|103|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Presently we heard him descending.|2|103|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Dupin was moving quickly to the door, when we again heard him coming up.|3|103|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He did not turn back a second time, but stepped up with decision and rapped at the door of our chamber.|4|103|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""Come in,"" said Dupin, in a cheerful and hearty tone."|0|104|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
A man entered.|0|105|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He was a sailor, evidently, --a tall, stout, and muscular-looking person, with a certain dare-devil expression of countenance, not altogether unprepossessing.|1|105|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
His face, greatly sunburnt, was more than half hidden by whisker and mustachio.|2|105|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He had with him a huge oaken cudgel, but appeared to be otherwise unarmed.|3|105|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"He bowed awkwardly, and bade us ""good evening,"" in French accents, which, although somewhat Neufchatelish, were still sufficiently indicative of a Parisian origin."|4|105|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"Sit down, my friend,"" said Dupin."|0|106|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""I suppose you have called about the Ourang-Outang."|1|106|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Upon my word, I almost envy you the possession of him; a remarkably fine, and no doubt a very valuable animal.|2|106|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"How old do you suppose him to be""?"|3|106|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""I have no way of telling --but he can't be more than four or five years old."|0|108|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"Have you got him here""?"|1|108|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""Oh no; we had no conveniences for keeping him here."|0|109|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He is at a livery stable in the Rue Dubourg, just by.|1|109|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
You can get him in the morning.|2|109|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"Of course you are prepared to identify the property""?"|3|109|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""To be sure I am, sir""."|0|110|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""I shall be sorry to part with him,"" said Dupin."|0|111|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""I don't mean that you should be at all this trouble for nothing, sir,"" said the man."|0|112|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""Couldn't expect it."|1|112|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"Am very willing to pay a reward for the finding of the animal --that is to say, any thing in reason""."|2|112|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""Well,"" replied my friend, ""that is all very fair, to be sure."|0|113|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Let me think!|1|113|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
--what should I have?|2|113|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Oh!|3|113|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I will tell you.|4|113|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
My reward shall be this.|5|113|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"You shall give me all the information in your power about these murders in the Rue Morgue""."|6|113|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Dupin said the last words in a very low tone, and very quietly.|0|114|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Just as quietly, too, he walked toward the door, locked it, and put the key in his pocket.|1|114|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He then drew a pistol from his bosom and placed it, without the least flurry, upon the table.|2|114|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The sailor's face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation.|0|115|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He started to his feet and grasped his cudgel; but the next moment he fell back into his seat, trembling violently, and with the countenance of death itself.|1|115|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He spoke not a word.|2|115|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I pitied him from the bottom of my heart.|3|115|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""My friend,"" said Dupin, in a kind tone, ""you are alarming yourself unnecessarily --you are indeed."|0|116|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
We mean you no harm whatever.|1|116|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I pledge you the honor of a gentleman, and of a Frenchman, that we intend you no injury.|2|116|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I perfectly well know that you are innocent of the atrocities in the Rue Morgue.|3|116|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It will not do, however, to deny that you are in some measure implicated in them.|4|116|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
From what I have already said, you must know that I have had means of information about this matter --means of which you could never have dreamed.|5|116|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Now the thing stands thus.|6|116|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
You have done nothing which you could have avoided --nothing, certainly, which renders you culpable.|7|116|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
You were not even guilty of robbery, when you might have robbed with impunity.|8|116|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
You have nothing to conceal.|9|116|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
You have no reason for concealment.|10|116|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
On the other hand, you are bound by every principle of honor to confess all you know.|11|116|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"An innocent man is now imprisoned, charged with that crime of which you can point out the perpetrator""."|12|116|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The sailor had recovered his presence of mind, in a great measure, while Dupin uttered these words; but his original boldness of bearing was all gone.|0|117|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""So help me God,"" said he, after a brief pause, ""I will tell you all I know about this affair; --but I do not expect you to believe one half I say --I would be a fool indeed if I did."|0|118|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"Still, I am innocent, and I will make a clean breast if I die for it""."|1|118|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
What he stated was, in substance, this.|0|119|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He had lately made a voyage to the Indian Archipelago.|1|119|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
A party, of which he formed one, landed at Borneo, and passed into the interior on an excursion of pleasure.|2|119|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Himself and a companion had captured the Ourang-Outang.|3|119|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
This companion dying, the animal fell into his own exclusive possession.|4|119|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
After great trouble, occasioned by the intractable ferocity of his captive during the home voyage, he at length succeeded in lodging it safely at his own residence in Paris, where, not to attract toward himself the unpleasant curiosity of his neighbors, he kept it carefully secluded, until such time as it should recover from a wound in the foot, received from a splinter on board ship.|5|119|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
His ultimate design was to sell it.|6|119|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Returning home from some sailors' frolic on the night, or rather in the morning of the murder, he found the beast occupying his own bed-room, into which it had broken from a closet adjoining, where it had been, as was thought, securely confined.|0|120|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Razor in hand, and fully lathered, it was sitting before a looking-glass, attempting the operation of shaving, in which it had no doubt previously watched its master through the key-hole of the closet.|1|120|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Terrified at the sight of so dangerous a weapon in the possession of an animal so ferocious, and so well able to use it, the man, for some moments, was at a loss what to do.|2|120|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He had been accustomed, however, to quiet the creature, even in its fiercest moods, by the use of a whip, and to this he now resorted.|3|120|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Upon sight of it, the Ourang-Outang sprang at once through the door of the chamber, down the stairs, and thence, through a window, unfortunately open, into the street.|4|120|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The Frenchman followed in despair; the ape, razor still in hand, occasionally stopping to look back and gesticulate at its pursuer, until the latter had nearly come up with it.|0|121|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It then again made off.|1|121|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
In this manner the chase continued for a long time.|2|121|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The streets were profoundly quiet, as it was nearly three o'clock in the morning.|3|121|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
In passing down an alley in the rear of the Rue Morgue, the fugitive's attention was arrested by a light gleaming from the open window of Madame L'Espanaye's chamber, in the fourth story of her house.|4|121|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Rushing to the building, it perceived the lightning-rod, clambered up with inconceivable agility, grasped the shutter, which was thrown fully back against the wall, and, by its means, swung itself directly upon the headboard of the bed.|5|121|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The whole feat did not occupy a minute.|6|121|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The shutter was kicked open again by the Ourang-Outang as it entered the room.|7|121|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The sailor, in the meantime, was both rejoiced and perplexed.|0|122|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
He had strong hopes of now recapturing the brute, as it could scarcely escape from the trap into which it had ventured, except by the rod, where it might be intercepted as it came down.|1|122|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
On the other hand, there was much cause for anxiety as to what it might do in the house.|2|122|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
This latter reflection urged the man still to follow the fugitive.|3|122|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
A lightning-rod is ascended without difficulty, especially by a sailor; but, when he had arrived as high as the window, which lay far to his left, his career was stopped; the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so as to obtain a glimpse of the interior of the room.|4|122|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
At this glimpse he nearly fell from his hold through excess of horror.|5|122|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Now it was that those hideous shrieks arose upon the night, which had startled from slumber the inmates of the Rue Morgue.|6|122|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter, habited in their night clothes, had apparently been arranging some papers in the iron chest already mentioned, which had been wheeled into the middle of the room.|7|122|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It was open, and its contents lay beside it on the floor.|8|122|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The victims must have been sitting with their backs toward the window; and, from the time elapsing between the ingress of the beast and the screams, it seems probable that it was not immediately perceived.|9|122|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The flapping-to of the shutter would naturally have been attributed to the wind.|10|122|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
As the sailor looked in, the gigantic animal had seized Madame L'Espanaye by the hair, (which was loose, as she had been combing it,) and was flourishing the razor about her face, in imitation of the motions of a barber.|0|123|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The daughter lay prostrate and motionless; she had swooned.|1|123|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The screams and struggles of the old lady (during which the hair was torn from her head) had the effect of changing the probably pacific purposes of the Ourang-Outang into those of wrath.|2|123|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
With one determined sweep of its muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her body.|3|123|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The sight of blood inflamed its anger into phrenzy.|4|123|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Gnashing its teeth, and flashing fire from its eves, it flew upon the body of the girl, and imbedded its fearful talons in her throat, retaining its grasp until she expired.|5|123|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Its wandering and wild glances fell at this moment upon the head of the bed, over which the face of its master, rigid with horror, was just discernible.|6|123|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The fury of the beast, who no doubt bore still in mind the dreaded whip, was instantly converted into fear.|7|123|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Conscious of having deserved punishment, it seemed desirous of concealing its bloody deeds, and skipped about the chamber in an agony of nervous agitation; throwing down and breaking the furniture as it moved, and dragging the bed from the bedstead.|8|123|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
In conclusion, it seized first the corpse of the daughter, and thrust it up the chimney, as it was found; then that of the old lady, which it immediately hurled through the window headlong.|9|123|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
As the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden, the sailor shrank aghast to the rod, and, rather gliding than clambering down it, hurried at once home --dreading the consequences of the butchery, and gladly abandoning, in his terror, all solicitude about the fate of the Ourang-Outang.|0|124|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The words heard by the party upon the staircase were the Frenchman's exclamations of horror and affright, commingled with the fiendish jabberings of the brute.|1|124|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I have scarcely anything to add.|0|125|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The Ourang-Outang must have escaped from the chamber, by the rod, just before the breaking of the door.|1|125|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It must have closed the window as it passed through it.|2|125|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It was subsequently caught by the owner himself, who obtained for it a very large sum at the Jardin des Plantes.|3|125|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Le Bon was instantly released, upon our narration of the circumstances (with some comments from Dupin) at the bureau of the Prefect of Police.|4|125|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
This functionary, however well disposed to my friend, could not altogether conceal his chagrin at the turn which affairs had taken, and was fain to indulge in a sarcasm or two, about the propriety of every person minding his own business.|5|125|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""Let them talk,"" said Dupin, who had not thought it necessary to reply."|0|126|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
"""Let him discourse; it will ease his conscience."|1|126|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I am satisfied with having defeated him in his own castle.|2|126|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
Nevertheless, that he failed in the solution of this mystery, is by no means that matter for wonder which he supposes it; for, in truth, our friend the Prefect is somewhat too cunning to be profound.|3|126|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
In his wisdom is no stamen.|4|126|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
It is all head and no body, like the pictures of the Goddess Laverna, --or, at best, all head and shoulders, like a codfish.|5|126|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
But he is a good creature after all.|6|126|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I like him especially for one master stroke of cant, by which he has attained his reputation for ingenuity.|7|126|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
I mean the way he has 'de nier ce qui est, et d'expliquer ce qui n'est pas.|8|126|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
* Rousseau, Nouvelle Heloise.|0|127|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|April 1841|Detective fiction
The ways of God in Nature, as in Providence, are not as our ways; nor are the models that we frame any way commensurate to the vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works, which have a depth in them greater than the well of Democritus.|0|1|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
WE had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag.|0|2|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
For some minutes the old man seemed too much exhausted to speak.|1|2|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""Not long ago,"" said he at length, ""and I could have guided you on this route as well as the youngest of my sons; but, about three years past, there happened to me an event such as never happened before to mortal man --or at least such as no man ever survived to tell of --and the six hours of deadly terror which I then endured have broken me up body and soul."|0|3|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
You suppose me a very old man --but I am not.|1|3|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
It took less than a single day to change these hairs from a jetty black to white, to weaken my limbs, and to unstring my nerves, so that I tremble at the least exertion, and am frightened at a shadow.|2|3|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"Do you know I can scarcely look over this little cliff without getting giddy""?"|3|3|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"The ""little cliff,"" upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown himself down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung over it, while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on its extreme and slippery edge --this ""little cliff"" arose, a sheer unobstructed precipice of black shining rock, some fifteen or sixteen hundred feet from the world of crags beneath us."|0|4|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Nothing would have tempted me to within half a dozen yards of its brink.|1|4|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
In truth so deeply was I excited by the perilous position of my companion, that I fell at full length upon the ground, clung to the shrubs around me, and dared not even glance upward at the sky --while I struggled in vain to divest myself of the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger from the fury of the winds.|2|4|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
It was long before I could reason myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the distance.|3|4|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""You must get over these fancies,"" said the guide, ""for I have brought you here that you might have the best possible view of the scene of that event I mentioned --and to tell you the whole story with the spot just under your eye""."|0|5|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""We are now,"" he continued, in that particularizing manner which distinguished him --""we are now close upon the Norwegian coast --in the sixty-eighth degree of latitude --in the great province of Nordland --and in the dreary district of Lofoden."|0|6|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The mountain upon whose top we sit is Helseggen, the Cloudy.|1|6|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"Now raise yourself up a little higher --hold on to the grass if you feel giddy --so --and look out beyond the belt of vapor beneath us, into the sea""."|2|6|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whose waters wore so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the Nubian geographer's account of the Mare Tenebrarum.|0|7|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
A panorama more deplorably desolate no human imagination can conceive.|1|7|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
To the right and left, as far as the eye could reach, there lay outstretched, like ramparts of the world, lines of horridly black and beetling cliff, whose character of gloom was but the more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against it its white and ghastly crest, howling and shrieking for ever.|2|7|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Just opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed, and at a distance of some five or six miles out at sea, there was visible a small, bleak-looking island; or, more properly, its position was discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was enveloped.|3|7|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
About two miles nearer the land, arose another of smaller size, hideously craggy and barren, and encompassed at various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks.|4|7|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more distant island and the shore, had something very unusual about it.|0|8|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Although, at the time, so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in the remote offing lay to under a double-reefed trysail, and constantly plunged her whole hull out of sight, still there was here nothing like a regular swell, but only a short, quick, angry cross dashing of water in every direction --as well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise.|1|8|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Of foam there was little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks.|2|8|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""The island in the distance,"" resumed the old man, ""is called by the Norwegians Vurrgh."|0|9|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The one midway is Moskoe.|1|9|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
That a mile to the northward is Ambaaren.|2|9|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Yonder are Iflesen, Hoeyholm, Kieldholm, Suarven, and Buckholm.|3|9|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Farther off --between Moskoe and Vurrgh --are Otterholm, Flimen, Sandflesen, and Skarholm.|4|9|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
These are the true names of the places --but why it has been thought necessary to name them at all, is more than either you or I can understand.|5|9|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Do you hear any thing?|6|9|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"Do you see any change in the water""?"|7|9|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
We had now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen, to which we had ascended from the interior of Lofoden, so that we had caught no glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit.|0|10|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
As the old man spoke, I became aware of a loud and gradually increasing sound, like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an American prairie; and at the same moment I perceived that what seamen term the chopping character of the ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing into a current which set to the eastward.|1|10|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Even while I gazed, this current acquired a monstrous velocity.|2|10|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Each moment added to its speed --to its headlong impetuosity.|3|10|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
In five minutes the whole sea, as far as Vurrgh, was lashed into ungovernable fury; but it was between Moskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway.|4|10|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Here the vast bed of the waters, seamed and scarred into a thousand conflicting channels, burst suddenly into phrensied convulsion --heaving, boiling, hissing --gyrating in gigantic and innumerable vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to the eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes except in precipitous descents.|5|10|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
In a few minutes more, there came over the scene another radical alteration.|0|11|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The general surface grew somewhat more smooth, and the whirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while prodigious streaks of foam became apparent where none had been seen before.|1|11|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
These streaks, at length, spreading out to a great distance, and entering into combination, took unto themselves the gyratory motion of the subsided vortices, and seemed to form the germ of another more vast.|2|11|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Suddenly --very suddenly --this assumed a distinct and definite existence, in a circle of more than half a mile in diameter.|3|11|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The edge of the whirl was represented by a broad belt of gleaming spray; but no particle of this slipped into the mouth of the terrific funnel, whose interior, as far as the eye could fathom it, was a smooth, shining, and jet-black wall of water, inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty-five degrees, speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering motion, and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice, half shriek, half roar, such as not even the mighty cataract of Niagara ever lifts up in its agony to Heaven.|4|11|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked.|0|12|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I threw myself upon my face, and clung to the scant herbage in an excess of nervous agitation.|1|12|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""This,"" said I at length, to the old man --""this can be nothing else than the great whirlpool of the Maelstrom""."|0|13|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""So it is sometimes termed,"" said he."|0|14|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""We Norwegians call it the Moskoe-strom, from the island of Moskoe in the midway""."|1|14|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me for what I saw.|0|15|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
That of Jonas Ramus, which is perhaps the most circumstantial of any, cannot impart the faintest conception either of the magnificence, or of the horror of the scene --or of the wild bewildering sense of the novel which confounds the beholder.|1|15|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I am not sure from what point of view the writer in question surveyed it, nor at what time; but it could neither have been from the summit of Helseggen, nor during a storm.|2|15|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
There are some passages of his description, nevertheless, which may be quoted for their details, although their effect is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of the spectacle.|3|15|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""Between Lofoden and Moskoe,"" he says, ""the depth of the water is between thirty-six and forty fathoms; but on the other side, toward Ver (Vurrgh) this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient passage for a vessel, without the risk of splitting on the rocks, which happens even in the calmest weather."|0|16|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
When it is flood, the stream runs up the country between Lofoden and Moskoe with a boisterous rapidity; but the roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest and most dreadful cataracts; the noise being heard several leagues off, and the vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth, that if a ship comes within its attraction, it is inevitably absorbed and carried down to the bottom, and there beat to pieces against the rocks; and when the water relaxes, the fragments thereof are thrown up again.|1|16|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
But these intervals of tranquillity are only at the turn of the ebb and flood, and in calm weather, and last but a quarter of an hour, its violence gradually returning.|2|16|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
When the stream is most boisterous, and its fury heightened by a storm, it is dangerous to come within a Norway mile of it.|3|16|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Boats, yachts, and ships have been carried away by not guarding against it before they were within its reach.|4|16|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
It likewise happens frequently, that whales come too near the stream, and are overpowered by its violence; and then it is impossible to describe their howlings and bellowings in their fruitless struggles to disengage themselves.|5|16|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
A bear once, attempting to swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by the stream and borne down, while he roared terribly, so as to be heard on shore.|6|16|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Large stocks of firs and pine trees, after being absorbed by the current, rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grew upon them.|7|16|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
This plainly shows the bottom to consist of craggy rocks, among which they are whirled to and fro.|8|16|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
This stream is regulated by the flux and reflux of the sea --it being constantly high and low water every six hours.|9|16|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"In the year 1645, early in the morning of Sexagesima Sunday, it raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the houses on the coast fell to the ground""."|10|16|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
In regard to the depth of the water, I could not see how this could have been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex.|0|17|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"The ""forty fathoms"" must have reference only to portions of the channel close upon the shore either of Moskoe or Lofoden."|1|17|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The depth in the centre of the Moskoe-strom must be immeasurably greater; and no better proof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained from even the sidelong glance into the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the highest crag of Helseggen.|2|17|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Looking down from this pinnacle upon the howling Phlegethon below, I could not help smiling at the simplicity with which the honest Jonas Ramus records, as a matter difficult of belief, the anecdotes of the whales and the bears; for it appeared to me, in fact, a self-evident thing, that the largest ships of the line in existence, coming within the influence of that deadly attraction, could resist it as little as a feather the hurricane, and must disappear bodily and at once.|3|17|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The attempts to account for the phenomenon --some of which, I remember, seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal --now wore a very different and unsatisfactory aspect.|0|18|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"The idea generally received is that this, as well as three smaller vortices among the Feroe islands, ""have no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling, at flux and reflux, against a ridge of rocks and shelves, which confines the water so that it precipitates itself like a cataract; and thus the higher the flood rises, the deeper must the fall be, and the natural result of all is a whirlpool or vortex, the prodigious suction of which is sufficiently known by lesser experiments""."|1|18|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
--These are the words of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.|2|18|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Kircher and others imagine that in the centre of the channel of the Maelstrom is an abyss penetrating the globe, and issuing in some very remote part --the Gulf of Bothnia being somewhat decidedly named in one instance.|3|18|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
This opinion, idle in itself, was the one to which, as I gazed, my imagination most readily assented; and, mentioning it to the guide, I was rather surprised to hear him say that, although it was the view almost universally entertained of the subject by the Norwegians, it nevertheless was not his own.|4|18|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
As to the former notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it; and here I agreed with him --for, however conclusive on paper, it becomes altogether unintelligible, and even absurd, amid the thunder of the abyss.|5|18|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""You have had a good look at the whirl now,"" said the old man, ""and if you will creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee, and deaden the roar of the water, I will tell you a story that will convince you I ought to know something of the Moskoe-strom""."|0|19|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.|0|20|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""Myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged smack of about seventy tons burthen, with which we were in the habit of fishing among the islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to Vurrgh."|0|21|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
In all violent eddies at sea there is good fishing, at proper opportunities, if one has only the courage to attempt it; but among the whole of the Lofoden coastmen, we three were the only ones who made a regular business of going out to the islands, as I tell you.|1|21|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The usual grounds are a great way lower down to the southward.|2|21|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
There fish can be got at all hours, without much risk, and therefore these places are preferred.|3|21|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The choice spots over here among the rocks, however, not only yield the finest variety, but in far greater abundance; so that we often got in a single day, what the more timid of the craft could not scrape together in a week.|4|21|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
In fact, we made it a matter of desperate speculation --the risk of life standing instead of labor, and courage answering for capital.|5|21|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""We kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast than this; and it was our practice, in fine weather, to take advantage of the fifteen minutes' slack to push across the main channel of the Moskoe-strom, far above the pool, and then drop down upon anchorage somewhere near Otterholm, or Sandflesen, where the eddies are not so violent as elsewhere."|0|22|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Here we used to remain until nearly time for slackwater again, when we weighed and made for home.|1|22|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
We never set out upon this expedition without a steady side wind for going and coming --one that we felt sure would not fall us before our return --and we seldom made a mis-calculation upon this point.|2|22|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Twice, during six years, we were forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead calm, which is a rare thing indeed just about here; and once we had to remain on the grounds nearly a week, starving to death, owing to a gale which blew up shortly after our arrival, and made the channel too boisterous to be thought of.|3|22|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Upon this occasion we should have been driven out to sea in spite of everything, (for the whirlpools threw us round and round so violently that, at length, we fouled our anchor and dragged it) if it had not been that we drifted into one of the innumerable cross currents-here to-day and gone to-morrow --which drove us under the lee of Flimen, where, by good luck, we brought up.|4|22|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""I could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we encountered 'on the ground' --it is a bad spot to be in, even in good weather --but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the Moskoe-strom itself without accident; although at times my heart has been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or before the slack."|0|23|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought it at starting, and then we made rather less way than we could wish, while the current rendered the smack unmanageable.|1|23|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
My eldest brother had a son eighteen years old, and I had two stout boys of my own.|2|23|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
These would have been of great assistance at such times, in using the sweeps, as well as afterward in fishing --but, somehow, although we ran the risk ourselves, we had not the heart to let the young ones get into the danger --for, after all said and done, it was a horrible danger, and that is the truth.|3|23|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""It is now within a few days of three years since what I am going to tell you occurred."|0|24|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
It was on the tenth of July, 18--, a day which the people of this part of the world will never forget --for it was one in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the heavens.|1|24|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
And yet all the morning, and indeed until late in the afternoon, there was a gentle and steady breeze from the south-west, while the sun shone brightly, so that the oldest seaman among us could not have foreseen what was to follow.|2|24|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""The three of us --my two brothers and myself --had crossed over to the islands about two o'clock P. M., and soon nearly loaded the smack with fine fish, which, we all remarked, were more plenty that day than we had ever known them."|0|25|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
It was just seven, by my watch, when we weighed and started for home, so as to make the worst of the Strom at slack water, which we knew would be at eight.|1|25|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""We set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter, and for some time spanked along at a great rate, never dreaming of danger, for indeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it."|0|26|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
All at once we were taken aback by a breeze from over Helseggen.|1|26|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
This was most unusual --something that had never happened to us before --and I began to feel a little uneasy, without exactly knowing why.|2|26|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
We put the boat on the wind, but could make no headway at all for the eddies, and I was upon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage, when, looking astern, we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular copper-colored cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity.|3|26|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""In the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away, and we were dead becalmed, drifting about in every direction."|0|27|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
This state of things, however, did not last long enough to give us time to think about it.|1|27|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
In less than a minute the storm was upon us --in less than two the sky was entirely overcast --and what with this and the driving spray, it became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the smack.|2|27|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""Such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing."|0|28|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The oldest seaman in Norway never experienced any thing like it.|1|28|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
We had let our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us; but, at the first puff, both our masts went by the board if they had been sawed off --the mainmast taking with it my as I youngest brother, who had lashed himself to it for safety.|2|28|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""Our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water."|0|29|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
It had a complete flush deck, with only a small hatch near the bow, and this hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when about to cross the Strom, by way of precaution against the chopping seas.|1|29|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
But for this circumstance we should have foundered at once --for we lay entirely buried for some moments.|2|29|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
How my elder brother escaped destruction I cannot say, for I never had an opportunity of ascertaining.|3|29|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
For my part, as soon as I had let the foresail run, I threw myself flat on deck, with my feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow, and with my hands grasping a ring-bolt near the foot of the foremast.|4|29|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
It was mere instinct that prompted me to do this --which was undoubtedly the very best thing I could have done --for I was too much flurried to think.|5|29|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""For some moments we were completely deluged, as I say, and all this time I held my breath, and clung to the bolt."|0|30|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
When I could stand it no longer I raised myself upon my knees, still keeping hold with my hands, and thus got my head clear.|1|30|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Presently our little boat gave herself a shake, just as a dog does in coming out of the water, and thus rid herself, in some measure, of the seas.|2|30|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I was now trying to get the better of the stupor that had come over me, and to collect my senses so as to see what was to be done, when I felt somebody grasp my arm.|3|30|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
It was my elder brother, and my heart leaped for joy, for I had made sure that he was overboard --but the next moment all this joy was turned into horror --for he put his mouth close to my ear, and screamed out the word 'Moskoe-strom!|4|30|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""No one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment."|0|31|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I shook from head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit of the ague.|1|31|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I knew what he meant by that one word well enough --I knew what he wished to make me understand.|2|31|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
With the wind that now drove us on, we were bound for the whirl of the Strom, and nothing could save us!|3|31|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""You perceive that in crossing the Strom channel, we always went a long way up above the whirl, even in the calmest weather, and then had to wait and watch carefully for the slack --but now we were driving right upon the pool itself, and in such a hurricane as this!"|0|32|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
'To be sure,' I thought, 'we shall get there just about the slack --there is some little hope in that' --but in the next moment I cursed myself for being so great a fool as to dream of hope at all.|1|32|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I knew very well that we were doomed, had we been ten times a ninety-gun ship.|2|32|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""By this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself, or perhaps we did not feel it so much, as we scudded before it, but at all events the seas, which at first had been kept down by the wind, and lay flat and frothing, now got up into absolute mountains."|0|33|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
A singular change, too, had come over the heavens.|1|33|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Around in every direction it was still as black as pitch, but nearly overhead there burst out, all at once, a circular rift of clear sky --as clear as I ever saw --and of a deep bright blue --and through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre that I never before knew her to wear.|2|33|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
She lit up every thing about us with the greatest distinctness --but, oh God, what a scene it was to light up!|3|33|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""I now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother --but in some manner which I could not understand, the din had so increased that I could not make him hear a single word, although I screamed at the top of my voice in his ear."|0|34|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Presently he shook his head, looking as pale as death, and held up one of his fingers, as to say 'listen!|1|34|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""At first I could not make out what he meant --but soon a hideous thought flashed upon me."|0|35|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I dragged my watch from its fob.|1|35|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
It was not going.|2|35|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I glanced as its face by the moonlight, and then burst into tears as I flung it far away into the ocean.|3|35|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
It had run down at seven o'clock!|4|35|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
We were behind the time of the slack, and the whirl of the Strom was in full fury!|5|35|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""When a boat is well built, properly trimmed, and not deep laden, the waves in a strong gale, when she is going large, seem always to slip from beneath her --which appears very strange to a landsman --and this is what is called riding, in sea phrase."|0|36|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""Well, so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly; but presently a gigantic sea happened to take us right under the counter, and bore us with it as it rose --up --up --as if into the sky."|0|37|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I would not have believed that any wave could rise so high.|1|37|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
And then down we came with a sweep, a slide, and a plunge, that made me feel sick and dizzy, as if I was falling from some lofty mountain-top in a dream.|2|37|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
But while we were up I had thrown a quick glance around --and that one glance was all sufficient.|3|37|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I saw our exact position in an instant.|4|37|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The Moskoe-strom whirlpool was about a quarter of a mile dead ahead --but no more like the every-day Moskoe-strom, than the whirl as you now see it, is like a mill-race.|5|37|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
If I had not known where we were, and what we had to expect, I should not have recognised the place at all.|6|37|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
As it was, I involuntarily closed my eyes in horror.|7|37|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The lids clenched themselves together as if in a spasm.|8|37|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""It could not have been more than two minutes afterwards until we suddenly felt the waves subside, and were enveloped in foam."|0|38|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The boat made a sharp half turn to larboard, and then shot off in its new direction like a thunderbolt.|1|38|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
At the same moment the roaring noise of the water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shriek --such a sound as you might imagine given out by the water-pipes of many thousand steam-vessels, letting off their steam all together.|2|38|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
We were now in the belt of surf that always surrounds the whirl; and I thought, of course, that another moment would plunge us into the abyss --down which we could only see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we were borne along.|3|38|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The boat did not seem to sink into the water at all, but to skim like an air-bubble upon the surface of the surge.|4|38|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Her starboard side was next the whirl, and on the larboard arose the world of ocean we had left.|5|38|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
It stood like a huge writhing wall between us and the horizon.|6|38|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""It may appear strange, but now, when we were in the very jaws of the gulf, I felt more composed than when we were only approaching it."|0|39|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Having made up my mind to hope no more, I got rid of a great deal of that terror which unmanned me at first.|1|39|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I suppose it was despair that strung my nerves.|2|39|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""It may look like boasting --but what I tell you is truth --I began to reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner, and how foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my own individual life, in view of so wonderful a manifestation of God's power."|0|40|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I do believe that I blushed with shame when this idea crossed my mind.|1|40|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
After a little while I became possessed with the keenest curiosity about the whirl itself.|2|40|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I positively felt a wish to explore its depths, even at the sacrifice I was going to make; and my principal grief was that I should never be able to tell my old companions on shore about the mysteries I should see.|3|40|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
These, no doubt, were singular fancies to occupy a man's mind in such extremity --and I have often thought since, that the revolutions of the boat around the pool might have rendered me a little light-headed.|4|40|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""There was another circumstance which tended to restore my self-possession; and this was the cessation of the wind, which could not reach us in our present situation --for, as you saw yourself, the belt of surf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean, and this latter now towered above us, a high, black, mountainous ridge."|0|41|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
If you have never been at sea in a heavy gale, you can form no idea of the confusion of mind occasioned by the wind and the spray together.|1|41|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
They blind, deafen and strangle you, and take away all power of action or reflection.|2|41|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
But we were now, in a great measure, rid of these annoyances --just as death-condemned felons in prison are allowed petty indulgences, forbidden them while their doom is yet uncertain.|3|41|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""How often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say."|0|42|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
We careered round and round for perhaps an hour, flying rather than floating, getting gradually more and more into the middle of the surge, and then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge.|1|42|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
All this time I had never let go of the ring-bolt.|2|42|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
My brother was at the stern, holding on to a large empty water-cask which had been securely lashed under the coop of the counter, and was the only thing on deck that had not been swept overboard when the gale first took us.|3|42|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
As we approached the brink of the pit he let go his hold upon this, and made for the ring, from which, in the agony of his terror, he endeavored to force my hands, as it was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp.|4|42|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I never felt deeper grief than when I saw him attempt this act --although I knew he was a madman when he did it --a raving maniac through sheer fright.|5|42|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I did not care, however, to contest the point with him.|6|42|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I thought it could make no difference whether either of us held on at all; so I let him have the bolt, and went astern to the cask.|7|42|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
This there was no great difficulty in doing; for the smack flew round steadily enough, and upon an even keel --only swaying to and fro, with the immense sweeps and swelters of the whirl.|8|42|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Scarcely had I secured myself in my new position, when we gave a wild lurch to starboard, and rushed headlong into the abyss.|9|42|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure

"""As I felt the sickening sweep of the descent, I had instinctively tightened my hold upon the barrel, and closed my eyes."|0|43|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
For some seconds I dared not open them --while I expected instant destruction, and wondered that I was not already in my death-struggles with the water.|1|43|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
But moment after moment elapsed.|2|43|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I still lived.|3|43|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The sense of falling had ceased; and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had been before while in the belt of foam, with the exception that she now lay more along.|4|43|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I took courage and looked once again upon the scene.|5|43|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""Never shall I forget the sensations of awe, horror, and admiration with which I gazed about me."|0|44|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The boat appeared to be hanging, as if by magic, midway down, upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in circumference, prodigious in depth, and whose perfectly smooth sides might have been mistaken for ebony, but for the bewildering rapidity with which they spun around, and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance they shot forth, as the rays of the full moon, from that circular rift amid the clouds which I have already described, streamed in a flood of golden glory along the black walls, and far away down into the inmost recesses of the abyss.|1|44|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""At first I was too much confused to observe anything accurately."|0|45|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The general burst of terrific grandeur was all that I beheld.|1|45|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
When I recovered myself a little, however, my gaze fell instinctively downward.|2|45|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
In this direction I was able to obtain an unobstructed view, from the manner in which the smack hung on the inclined surface of the pool.|3|45|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
She was quite upon an even keel --that is to say, her deck lay in a plane parallel with that of the water --but this latter sloped at an angle of more than forty-five degrees, so that we seemed to be lying upon our beam-ends.|4|45|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I could not help observing, nevertheless, that I had scarcely more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in this situation, than if we had been upon a dead level; and this, I suppose, was owing to the speed at which we revolved.|5|45|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""The rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profound gulf; but still I could make out nothing distinctly, on account of a thick mist in which everything there was enveloped, and over which there hung a magnificent rainbow, like that narrow and tottering bridge which Mussulmen say is the only pathway between Time and Eternity."|0|46|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
This mist, or spray, was no doubt occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of the funnel, as they all met together at the bottom --but the yell that went up to the Heavens from out of that mist, I dare not attempt to describe.|1|46|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""Our first slide into the abyss itself, from the belt of foam above, had carried us to a great distance down the slope; but our farther descent was by no means proportionate."|0|47|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Round and round we swept --not with any uniform movement --but in dizzying swings and jerks, that sent us sometimes only a few hundred feet --sometimes nearly the complete circuit of the whirl.|1|47|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Our progress downward, at each revolution, was slow, but very perceptible.|2|47|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""Looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we were thus borne, I perceived that our boat was not the only object in the embrace of the whirl."|0|48|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Both above and below us were visible fragments of vessels, large masses of building timber and trunks of trees, with many smaller articles, such as pieces of house furniture, broken boxes, barrels and staves.|1|48|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I have already described the unnatural curiosity which had taken the place of my original terrors.|2|48|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
It appeared to grow upon me as I drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom.|3|48|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I now began to watch, with a strange interest, the numerous things that floated in our company.|4|48|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I must have been delirious --for I even sought amusement in speculating upon the relative velocities of their several descents toward the foam below.|5|48|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
'This fir tree,' I found myself at one time saying, 'will certainly be the next thing that takes the awful plunge and disappears,' --and then I was disappointed to find that the wreck of a Dutch merchant ship overtook it and went down before.|6|48|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
At length, after making several guesses of this nature, and being deceived in all --this fact --the fact of my invariable miscalculation, set me upon a train of reflection that made my limbs again tremble, and my heart beat heavily once more.|7|48|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""It was not a new terror that thus affected me, but the dawn of a more exciting hope."|0|49|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
This hope arose partly from memory, and partly from present observation.|1|49|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I called to mind the great variety of buoyant matter that strewed the coast of Lofoden, having been absorbed and then thrown forth by the Moskoe-strom.|2|49|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
By far the greater number of the articles were shattered in the most extraordinary way --so chafed and roughened as to have the appearance of being stuck full of splinters --but then I distinctly recollected that there were some of them which were not disfigured at all.|3|49|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Now I could not account for this difference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were the only ones which had been completely absorbed --that the others had entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide, or, from some reason, had descended so slowly after entering, that they did not reach the bottom before the turn of the flood came, or of the ebb, as the case might be.|4|49|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I conceived it possible, in either instance, that they might thus be whirled up again to the level of the ocean, without undergoing the fate of those which had been drawn in more early or absorbed more rapidly.|5|49|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I made, also, three important observations.|6|49|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The first was, that as a general rule, the larger the bodies were, the more rapid their descent; --the second, that, between two masses of equal extent, the one spherical, and the other of any other shape, the superiority in speed of descent was with the sphere; --the third, that, between two masses of equal size, the one cylindrical, and the other of any other shape, the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly.|7|49|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Since my escape, I have had several conversations on this subject with an old school-master of the district; and it was from him that I learned the use of the words 'cylinder' and 'sphere.|0|50|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
' He explained to me --although I have forgotten the explanation --how what I observed was, in fact, the natural consequence of the forms of the floating fragments --and showed me how it happened that a cylinder, swimming in a vortex, offered more resistance to its suction, and was drawn in with greater difficulty than an equally bulky body, of any form whatever.|1|50|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure

"""There was one startling circumstance which went a great way in enforcing these observations, and rendering me anxious to turn them to account, and this was that, at every revolution, we passed something like a barrel, or else the broken yard or the mast of a vessel, while many of these things, which had been on our level when I first opened my eyes upon the wonders of the whirlpool, were now high up above us, and seemed to have moved but little from their original station."|0|52|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""I no longer hesitated what to do."|0|53|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I resolved to lash myself securely to the water cask upon which I now held, to cut it loose from the counter, and to throw myself with it into the water.|1|53|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I attracted my brother's attention by signs, pointed to the floating barrels that came near us, and did everything in my power to make him understand what I was about to do.|2|53|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I thought at length that he comprehended my design --but, whether this was the case or not, he shook his head despairingly, and refused to move from his station by the ring-bolt.|3|53|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
It was impossible to force him; the emergency admitted no delay; and so, with a bitter struggle, I resigned him to his fate, fastened myself to the cask by means of the lashings which secured it to the counter, and precipitated myself with it into the sea, without another moment's hesitation.|4|53|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
"""The result was precisely what I had hoped it might be."|0|54|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
As it is myself who now tell you this tale --as you see that I did escape --and as you are already in possession of the mode in which this escape was effected, and must therefore anticipate all that I have farther to say --I will bring my story quickly to conclusion.|1|54|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
It might have been an hour, or thereabout, after my quitting the smack, when, having descended to a vast distance beneath me, it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid succession, and, bearing my loved brother with it, plunged headlong, at once and forever, into the chaos of foam below.|2|54|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The barrel to which I was attached sunk very little farther than half the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the spot at which I leaped overboard, before a great change took place in the character of the whirlpool.|3|54|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The slope of the sides of the vast funnel became momently less and less steep.|4|54|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The gyrations of the whirl grew, gradually, less and less violent.|5|54|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
By degrees, the froth and the rainbow disappeared, and the bottom of the gulf seemed slowly to uprise.|6|54|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
The sky was clear, the winds had gone down, and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west, when I found myself on the surface of the ocean, in full view of the shores of Lofoden, and above the spot where the pool of the Moskoe-strom had been.|7|54|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
It was the hour of the slack --but the sea still heaved in mountainous waves from the effects of the hurricane.|8|54|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
I was borne violently into the channel of the Strom and in a few minutes, was hurried down the coast into the 'grounds' of the fishermen.|9|54|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
A boat picked me up --exhausted from fatigue --and (now that the danger was removed) speechless from the memory of its horror.|10|54|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure
Those who drew me on board were my old mates and dally companions --but they knew me no more than they would have known a traveller from the spirit-land.|11|54|A Descent Into The Maelström|April 1841|Adventure

Nullus enim locus sine genio est.|0|0|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
"""LA MUSIQUE,"" says Marmontel, in those ""Contes Moraux""* which in all our translations, we have insisted upon calling ""Moral Tales,"" as if in mockery of their spirit–""la musique est le seul des talents qui jouissent de lui-meme; tous les autres veulent des temoins""."|0|1|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
He here confounds the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity for creating them.|1|1|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
No more than any other talent, is that for music susceptible of complete enjoyment, where there is no second party to appreciate its exercise.|2|1|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
And it is only in common with other talents that it produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude.|3|1|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
The idea which the raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly, or has sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point, is, doubtless, the very tenable one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively alone.|4|1|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
The proposition, in this form, will be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake, and for its spiritual uses.|5|1|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
But there is one pleasure still within the reach of mortality and perhaps only one–which owes even more than does music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion.|6|1|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
I mean the happiness experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery.|7|1|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
In truth, the man who would behold aright the glory of God upon earth must in solitude behold that glory.|8|1|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
To me, at least, the presence–not of human life only, but of life in any other form than that of the green things which grow upon the soil and are voiceless–is a stain upon the landscape–is at war with the genius of the scene.|9|1|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
I love, indeed, to regard the dark valleys, and the gray rocks, and the waters that silently smile, and the forests that sigh in uneasy slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains that look down upon all,–I love to regard these as themselves but the colossal members of one vast animate and sentient whole–a whole whose form (that of the sphere) is the most perfect and most inclusive of all; whose path is among associate planets; whose meek handmaiden is the moon, whose mediate sovereign is the sun; whose life is eternity, whose thought is that of a God; whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destinies are lost in immensity, whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own cognizance of the animalculae which infest the brain–a being which we, in consequence, regard as purely inanimate and material much in the same manner as these animalculae must thus regard us.|10|1|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy

Our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every hand–notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood–that space, and therefore that bulk, is an important consideration in the eyes of the Almighty.|0|3|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
The cycles in which the stars move are those best adapted for the evolution, without collision, of the greatest possible number of bodies.|1|3|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
The forms of those bodies are accurately such as, within a given surface, to include the greatest possible amount of matter;–while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate a denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces otherwise arranged.|2|3|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
Nor is it any argument against bulk being an object with God, that space itself is infinite; for there may be an infinity of matter to fill it.|3|3|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
And since we see clearly that the endowment of matter with vitality is a principle–indeed, as far as our judgments extend, the leading principle in the operations of Deity,–it is scarcely logical to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute, where we daily trace it, and not extending to those of the august.|4|3|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
As we find cycle within cycle without end,–yet all revolving around one far-distant centre which is the God-head, may we not analogically suppose in the same manner, life within life, the less within the greater, and all within the Spirit Divine?|5|3|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
"In short, we are madly erring, through self-esteem, in believing man, in either his temporal or future destinies, to be of more moment in the universe than that vast ""clod of the valley"" which he tills and contemns, and to which he denies a soul for no more profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation."|6|3|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy

These fancies, and such as these, have always given to my meditations among the mountains and the forests, by the rivers and the ocean, a tinge of what the everyday world would not fail to term fantastic.|0|5|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
My wanderings amid such scenes have been many, and far-searching, and often solitary; and the interest with which I have strayed through many a dim, deep valley, or gazed into the reflected Heaven of many a bright lake, has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that I have strayed and gazed alone.|1|5|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy

The epigram cannot be gainsayed; but the necessity is a thing that does not exist.|3|5|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
It was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant region of mountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers and melancholy tarn writhing or sleeping within all–that I chanced upon a certain rivulet and island.|0|6|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
I came upon them suddenly in the leafy June, and threw myself upon the turf, beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub, that I might doze as I contemplated the scene.|1|6|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
I felt that thus only should I look upon it–such was the character of phantasm which it wore.|2|6|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
On all sides–save to the west, where the sun was about sinking- arose the verdant walls of the forest.|0|7|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
The little river which turned sharply in its course, and was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to have no exit from its prison, but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of the trees to the east–while in the opposite quarter (so it appeared to me as I lay at length and glanced upward) there poured down noiselessly and continuously into the valley, a rich golden and crimson waterfall from the sunset fountains of the sky.|1|7|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy

The grass wore the deep tint of the cypress, and the heads of its blades hung droopingly, and hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks, low and narrow, and not very long, that had the aspect of graves, but were not; although over and all about them the rue and the rosemary clambered.|3|13|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
The shade of the trees fell heavily upon the water, and seemed to bury itself therein, impregnating the depths of the element with darkness.|4|13|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy

As I thus mused, with half-shut eyes, while the sun sank rapidly to rest, and eddying currents careered round and round the island, bearing upon their bosom large, dazzling, white flakes of the bark of the sycamore-flakes which, in their multiform positions upon the water, a quick imagination might have converted into any thing it pleased, while I thus mused, it appeared to me that the form of one of those very Fays about whom I had been pondering made its way slowly into the darkness from out the light at the western end of the island.|0|15|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
She stood erect in a singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom of an oar.|1|15|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy

And again the boat appeared and the Fay, but about the attitude of the latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy.|0|16|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
She floated again from out the light and into the gloom (which deepened momently) and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water, and became absorbed into its blackness.|1|16|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
And again and again she made the circuit of the island, (while the sun rushed down to his slumbers), and at each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person, while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at each passage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which became whelmed in a shadow more black.|2|16|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy
But at length when the sun had utterly departed, the Fay, now the mere ghost of her former self, went disconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood, and that she issued thence at all I cannot say, for darkness fell over an things and I beheld her magical figure no more.|3|16|The Island Of The Fay|June 1841|Fantasy

That earnest mutual love, my own Monos, which burned within our bosoms; how vainly did we flatter ourselves, feeling happy in its first upspringing, that our happiness would strengthen with its strength!|4|6|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
Alas!|5|6|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction

There were periods in each of the five or six centuries immediately preceding our dissolution, when arose some vigorous intellect, boldly contending for those principles whose truth appears now, to our disenfranchised reason, so utterly obvious; principles which should have taught our race to submit to the guidance of the natural laws, rather than attempt their control.|3|13|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
At long intervals some master-minds appeared, looking upon each advance in practical science as a retro-gradation in the true utility.|4|13|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
Occasionally the poetic intellect; that intellect which we now feel to have been the most exalted of all; since those truths which to us were of the most enduring importance could only be reached by that analogy which speaks in proof-tones to the imagination alone, and to the unaided reason bears no weight- occasionally did this poetic intellect proceed a step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of the philosophic, and find in the mystic parable that tells of the tree of knowledge, and of its forbidden fruit, death-producing, a distinct intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the infant condition of his soul.|5|13|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
"And these men, the poets, living and perishing amid the scorn of the ""utilitarians""; or rough pedants, who arrogated to themselves a title which could have been properly applied only to the scorned- these men, the poets, ponder piningly, yet not unwisely, upon the ancient days when our wants were not more simple than our enjoyments were keen; days when mirth was a word unknown, so solemnly deep-toned was happiness; holy, august and blissful days, when blue rivers ran undammed, between hills unhewn, into far forest solitudes, primeval, odorous, and unexplored."|6|13|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
Yet these noble exceptions from the general misrule served but to strengthen it by opposition.|0|14|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction

But now it appears that we had worked out our own destruction in the perversion of our taste, or rather in the blind neglect of its culture in the schools.|16|14|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
For, in truth, it was at this crisis that taste alone; that faculty which, holding a middle position between the pure intellect and the moral sense, could never safely have been disregarded; it was now that taste alone could have led us gently back to Beauty, to Nature, and to Life.|17|14|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction

Wearied at heart with anxieties which had their origin in the general turmoil and decay, I succumbed to the fierce fever.|3|21|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
After some few days of pain, and many of dreamy delirium replete with ecstasy, the manifestations of which you mistook for pain, while I longed but was impotent to undeceive you; after some days there came upon me, as you have said, a breathless and motionless torpor; and this was termed Death by those who stood around me.|4|21|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction

The rosewater with which your tenderness had moistened my lips to the last, affected me with sweet fancies of flowers; fantastic flowers, far more lovely than any of the old Earth, but whose prototypes we have here blooming around us.|6|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
The eyelids, transparent and bloodless, offered no complete impediment to vision.|7|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
As volition was in abeyance the balls could not roll in their sockets; but all objects within the range of the visual hemisphere were seen with more or less distinctness; the rays which fell upon the external retina, or into the corner of the eye, producing a more vivid effect than those which struck the front or anterior surface.|8|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
Yet, in the former instance, this effect was so far anomalous that I appreciated it only as sound; sound sweet or discordant as the matters presenting themselves at my side were light or dark in shade; curved or angular in outline.|9|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
The hearing at the same time, although excited in degree, was not irregular in action; estimating real sounds with an extravagance of precision, not less than of sensibility.|10|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction

Thus the pressure of your sweet fingers upon my eyelids, at first only recognized through vision, at length, long after their removal, filled my whole being with a sensual delight immeasurable.|13|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
I say with a sensual delight.|14|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
All my perceptions were purely sensual.|15|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
The materials furnished the passive brain by the senses were not in the least degree wrought into shape by the deceased understanding.|16|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
Of pain there was some little; of pleasure there was much; but of moral pain or pleasure none at all.|17|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
Thus your wild sobs floated into my ears with all their mournful cadences, and were appreciated in their every variation of sad tone; but they were soft musical sounds and no more; they conveyed to the extinct reason no intimation of the sorrows which gave them birth; while the large and constant tears which fell upon my face, telling the bystanders of a heart which broke, thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy alone.|18|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
And this was in truth the Death of which these bystanders spoke reverently, in low whispers; you, sweet Una, gaspingly, with loud cries.|19|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction

You alone, habited in a white robe, passed in all directions musically about me.|2|24|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
The day waned; and, as its light faded away, I became possessed by a vague uneasiness; an anxiety such as the sleeper feels when sad real sounds fall continuously within his ear; low distant bell tones, solemn, at long but equal intervals, and commingling with melancholy dreams.|0|25|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
Night arrived; and with its shadows a heavy discomfort.|1|25|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
It oppressed my limbs with the oppression of some dull weight, and was palpable.|2|25|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
There was also a moaning sound, not unlike the distant reverberation of surf, but more continuous, which beginning with the first twilight, had grown in strength with the darkness.|3|25|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
Suddenly lights were brought into the room, and this reverberation became forthwith interrupted into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound, but less dreary and less distinct.|4|25|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
The ponderous oppression was in a great measure relieved; and, issuing from the flame of each lamp, (for there were many,) there flowed unbrokenly into my ears a strain of melodious monotone.|5|25|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
And when now, dear Una, approaching the bed upon which I lay outstretched, you sat gently by my side, breathing odor from your sweet lips, and pressing them upon my brow, there arose tremulously within my bosom, and mingling with the merely physical sensations which circumstances had called forth, a something akin to sentiment itself; a feeling that, half appreciating, half responded to your earnest love and sorrow,; but this feeling took no root in the pulseless heart, and seemed indeed rather a shadow than a reality, and faded quickly away, first into extreme quiescence, and then into a purely sensual pleasure as before.|6|25|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction

No muscle quivered; no nerve thrilled; no artery throbbed.|3|26|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
But there seemed to have sprung up in the brain, that of which no words could convey to the merely human intelligence even an indistinct conception.|4|26|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction

And this; this keen, perfect, self-existing sentiment of duration; this sentiment existing (as man could not possibly have conceived it to exist) independently of any succession of events; this idea; this sixth sense, upspringing from the ashes of the rest, was the first obvious and certain step of the intemporal soul upon the threshold of the temporal Eternity.|12|26|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction
It was midnight; and you still sat by my side.|0|27|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction

So, too, when the noon of the second day came, I was not unconscious of those movements which displaced you from my side, which confined me within the coffin, which deposited me within the hearse, which bore me to the grave, which lowered me within it, which heaped heavily the mould upon me, and which thus left me, in blackness and corruption, to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm.|2|28|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|August 1841|Science fiction

here replied Toby, just as if he had been reading my thoughts, and looking like a very old sheep in a revery.|1|22|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
The old gentleman now took him by the arm, and led him more into the shade of the bridge–a few paces back from the turnstile.|0|23|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
"""My good fellow,"" said he, ""I make it a point of conscience to allow you this much run."|1|23|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
Wait here, till I take my place by the stile, so that I may see whether you go over it handsomely, and transcendentally, and don't omit any flourishes of the pigeon-wing.|2|23|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
A mere form, you know.|3|23|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire

"Punctually at the word ""away,"" my poor friend set off in a strong gallop."|0|25|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
The stile was not very high, like Mr. Lord's–nor yet very low, like that of Mr. Lord's reviewers, but upon the whole I made sure that he would clear it.|1|25|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
And then what if he did not?|2|25|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
–ah, that was the question–what if he did not?|3|25|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
"""What right,"" said I, ""had the old gentleman to make any other gentleman jump?"|4|25|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire

"If he asks me to jump, I won't do it, that's flat, and I don't care who the devil he is""."|7|25|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
The bridge, as I say, was arched and covered in, in a very ridiculous manner, and there was a most uncomfortable echo about it at all times–an echo which I never before so particularly observed as when I uttered the four last words of my remark.|8|25|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
But what I said, or what I thought, or what I heard, occupied only an instant.|0|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
In less than five seconds from his starting, my poor Toby had taken the leap.|1|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
I saw him run nimbly, and spring grandly from the floor of the bridge, cutting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he went up.|2|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
I saw him high in the air, pigeon-winging it to admiration just over the top of the stile; and of course I thought it an unusually singular thing that he did not continue to go over.|3|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
But the whole leap was the affair of a moment, and, before I had a chance to make any profound reflections, down came Mr. Dammit on the flat of his back, on the same side of the stile from which he had started.|4|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
At the same instant I saw the old gentleman limping off at the top of his speed, having caught and wrapt up in his apron something that fell heavily into it from the darkness of the arch just over the turnstile.|5|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
At all this I was much astonished; but I had no leisure to think, for Dammit lay particularly still, and I concluded that his feelings had been hurt, and that he stood in need of my assistance.|6|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
I hurried up to him and found that he had received what might be termed a serious injury.|7|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
The truth is, he had been deprived of his head, which after a close search I could not find anywhere; so I determined to take him home and send for the homoeopathists.|8|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
In the meantime a thought struck me, and I threw open an adjacent window of the bridge, when the sad truth flashed upon me at once.|9|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
About five feet just above the top of the turnstile, and crossing the arch of the foot-path so as to constitute a brace, there extended a flat iron bar, lying with its breadth horizontally, and forming one of a series that served to strengthen the structure throughout its extent.|10|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
With the edge of this brace it appeared evident that the neck of my unfortunate friend had come precisely in contact.|11|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
He did not long survive his terrible loss.|0|27|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
The homoeopathists did not give him little enough physic, and what little they did give him he hesitated to take.|1|27|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
So in the end he grew worse, and at length died, a lesson to all riotous livers.|2|27|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
I bedewed his grave with my tears, worked a bar sinister on his family escutcheon, and, for the general expenses of his funeral, sent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists.|3|27|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
The scoundrels refused to pay it, so I had Mr. Dammit dug up at once, and sold him for dog's meat.|4|27|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|September 1841|Satire
"YOU hard-headed, dunder-headed, obstinate, rusty, crusty, musty, fusty, old savage""!"|0|0|Three Sundays In A Week|November 27, 1841|Humor

Only in imagination.|0|1|Three Sundays In A Week|November 27, 1841|Humor
The fact is, some trivial discrepancy did exist, just then, between what I said and what I had not the courage to say–between what I did and what I had half a mind to do.|1|1|Three Sundays In A Week|November 27, 1841|Humor
The old porpoise, as I opened the drawing-room door, was sitting with his feet upon the mantel-piece, and a bumper of port in his paw, making strenuous efforts to accomplish the ditty.|0|2|Three Sundays In A Week|November 27, 1841|Humor

"A very ""fine old English gentleman,"" was my grand-uncle Rumgudgeon, but unlike him of the song, he had his weak points."|0|18|Three Sundays In A Week|November 27, 1841|Humor
He was a little, pursy, pompous, passionate semicircular somebody, with a red nose, a thick scull, [sic] a long purse, and a strong sense of his own consequence.|1|18|Three Sundays In A Week|November 27, 1841|Humor
With the best heart in the world, he contrived, through a predominant whim of contradiction, to earn for himself, among those who only knew him superficially, the character of a curmudgeon.|2|18|Three Sundays In A Week|November 27, 1841|Humor
Like many excellent people, he seemed possessed with a spirit of tantalization, which might easily, at a casual glance, have been mistaken for malevolence.|3|18|Three Sundays In A Week|November 27, 1841|Humor
"To every request, a positive ""No""!"|4|18|Three Sundays In A Week|November 27, 1841|Humor

Against all attacks upon his purse he made the most sturdy defence; but the amount extorted from him, at last, was generally in direct ratio with the length of the siege and the stubbornness of the resistance.|6|18|Three Sundays In A Week|November 27, 1841|Humor
In charity no one gave more liberally or with a worse grace.|7|18|Three Sundays In A Week|November 27, 1841|Humor
For the fine arts, and especially for the belles-lettres, he entertained a profound contempt.|0|19|Three Sundays In A Week|November 27, 1841|Humor
"With this he had been inspired by Casimir Perier, whose pert little query ""A quoi un poete est il bon""?"|1|19|Three Sundays In A Week|November 27, 1841|Humor

Somebody had accosted him in the street, mistaking him for no less a personage than Doctor Dubble L. Dee, the lecturer upon quack physics.|6|19|Three Sundays In A Week|November 27, 1841|Humor
This set him off at a tangent; and just at the epoch of this story–for story it is getting to be after all–my grand-uncle Rumgudgeon was accessible and pacific only upon points which happened to chime in with the caprioles of the hobby he was riding.|7|19|Three Sundays In A Week|November 27, 1841|Humor
For the rest, he laughed with his arms and legs, and his politics were stubborn and easily understood.|8|19|Three Sundays In A Week|November 27, 1841|Humor

Now it was this latter peculiarity in his disposition, of which Kates ingenuity enabled us one fine day, not long after our interview in the dining-room, to take a very unexpected advantage, and, having thus, in the fashion of all modern bards and orators, exhausted in prolegomena, all the time at my command, and nearly all the room at my disposal, I will sum up in a few words what constitutes the whole pith of the story.|6|21|Three Sundays In A Week|November 27, 1841|Humor

THE CHATEAU into which my valet had ventured to make forcible entrance, rather than permit me, in my desperately wounded condition, to pass a night in the open air, was one of those piles of commingled gloom and grandeur which have so long frowned among the Appennines, not less in fact than in the fancy of Mrs. Radcliffe.|0|0|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
To all appearance it had been temporarily and very lately abandoned.|1|0|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
We established ourselves in one of the smallest and least sumptuously furnished apartments.|2|0|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
It lay in a remote turret of the building.|3|0|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
Its decorations were rich, yet tattered and antique.|4|0|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
Its walls were hung with tapestry and bedecked with manifold and multiform armorial trophies, together with an unusually great number of very spirited modern paintings in frames of rich golden arabesque.|5|0|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
In these paintings, which depended from the walls not only in their main surfaces, but in very many nooks which the bizarre architecture of the chateau rendered necessary–in these paintings my incipient delirium, perhaps, had caused me to take deep interest; so that I bade Pedro to close the heavy shutters of the room–since it was already night–to light the tongues of a tall candelabrum which stood by the head of my bed–and to throw open far and wide the fringed curtains of black velvet which enveloped the bed itself.|6|0|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
I wished all this done that I might resign myself, if not to sleep, at least alternately to the contemplation of these pictures, and the perusal of a small volume which had been found upon the pillow, and which purported to criticise and describe them.|7|0|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
Long–long I read–and devoutly, devotedly I gazed.|0|1|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
Rapidly and gloriously the hours flew by and the deep midnight came.|1|1|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
The position of the candelabrum displeased me, and outreaching my hand with difficulty, rather than disturb my slumbering valet, I placed it so as to throw its rays more fully upon the book.|2|1|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
But the action produced an effect altogether unanticipated.|0|2|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
The rays of the numerous candles (for there were many) now fell within a niche of the room which had hitherto been thrown into deep shade by one of the bed-posts.|1|2|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
I thus saw in vivid light a picture all unnoticed before.|2|2|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
It was the portrait of a young girl just ripening into womanhood.|3|2|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
I glanced at the painting hurriedly, and then closed my eyes.|4|2|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
Why I did this was not at first apparent even to my own perception.|5|2|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
But while my lids remained thus shut, I ran over in my mind my reason for so shutting them.|6|2|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
It was an impulsive movement to gain time for thought–to make sure that my vision had not deceived me–to calm and subdue my fancy for a more sober and more certain gaze.|7|2|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
In a very few moments I again looked fixedly at the painting.|8|2|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
That I now saw aright I could not and would not doubt; for the first flashing of the candles upon that canvas had seemed to dissipate the dreamy stupor which was stealing over my senses, and to startle me at once into waking life.|0|3|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
The portrait, I have already said, was that of a young girl.|0|4|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
It was a mere head and shoulders, done in what is technically termed a vignette manner; much in the style of the favorite heads of Sully.|1|4|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
The arms, the bosom, and even the ends of the radiant hair melted imperceptibly into the vague yet deep shadow which formed the back-ground of the whole.|2|4|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
The frame was oval, richly gilded and filigreed in Moresque.|3|4|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
As a thing of art nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself.|4|4|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
But it could have been neither the execution of the work, nor the immortal beauty of the countenance, which had so suddenly and so vehemently moved me.|5|4|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
Least of all, could it have been that my fancy, shaken from its half slumber, had mistaken the head for that of a living person.|6|4|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
I saw at once that the peculiarities of the design, of the vignetting, and of the frame, must have instantly dispelled such idea–must have prevented even its momentary entertainment.|7|4|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
Thinking earnestly upon these points, I remained, for an hour perhaps, half sitting, half reclining, with my vision riveted upon the portrait.|8|4|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
At length, satisfied with the true secret of its effect, I fell back within the bed.|9|4|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
I had found the spell of the picture in an absolute life-likeliness of expression, which, at first startling, finally confounded, subdued, and appalled me.|10|4|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
With deep and reverent awe I replaced the candelabrum in its former position.|11|4|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
The cause of my deep agitation being thus shut from view, I sought eagerly the volume which discussed the paintings and their histories.|12|4|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
"""She was a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee."|0|5|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
And evil was the hour when she saw, and loved, and wedded the painter.|1|5|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
He, passionate, studious, austere, and having already a bride in his Art; she a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee; all light and smiles, and frolicsome as the young fawn; loving and cherishing all things; hating only the Art which was her rival; dreading only the pallet and brushes and other untoward instruments which deprived her of the countenance of her lover.|2|5|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
It was thus a terrible thing for this lady to hear the painter speak of his desire to pourtray even his young bride.|3|5|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
But she was humble and obedient, and sat meekly for many weeks in the dark, high turret-chamber where the light dripped upon the pale canvas only from overhead.|4|5|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
But he, the painter, took glory in his work, which went on from hour to hour, and from day to day.|5|5|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
And be was a passionate, and wild, and moody man, who became lost in reveries; so that he would not see that the light which fell so ghastly in that lone turret withered the health and the spirits of his bride, who pined visibly to all but him.|6|5|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
Yet she smiled on and still on, uncomplainingly, because she saw that the painter (who had high renown) took a fervid and burning pleasure in his task, and wrought day and night to depict her who so loved him, yet who grew daily more dispirited and weak.|7|5|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
And in sooth some who beheld the portrait spoke of its resemblance in low words, as of a mighty marvel, and a proof not less of the power of the painter than of his deep love for her whom he depicted so surpassingly well.|8|5|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
But at length, as the labor drew nearer to its conclusion, there were admitted none into the turret; for the painter had grown wild with the ardor of his work, and turned his eyes from canvas merely, even to regard the countenance of his wife.|9|5|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
And he would not see that the tints which he spread upon the canvas were drawn from the cheeks of her who sate beside him.|10|5|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
And when many weeks bad passed, and but little remained to do, save one brush upon the mouth and one tint upon the eye, the spirit of the lady again flickered up as the flame within the socket of the lamp.|11|5|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
And then the brush was given, and then the tint was placed; and, for one moment, the painter stood entranced before the work which he had wrought; but in the next, while he yet gazed, he grew tremulous and very pallid, and aghast, and crying with a loud voice, 'This is indeed Life itself!|12|5|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror
' turned suddenly to regard his beloved:–She was dead!|13|5|The Oval Portrait|April 1842|Horror

It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade.|0|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
But first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held.|1|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
There were seven --an imperial suite.|2|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
In many palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded.|3|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
Here the case was very different; as might have been expected from the duke's love of the bizarre.|4|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time.|5|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
There was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect.|6|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
To the right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite.|7|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
These windows were of stained glass whose color varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened.|8|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
That at the eastern extremity was hung, for example, in blue --and vividly blue were its windows.|9|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
The second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were purple.|10|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
The third was green throughout, and so were the casements.|11|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
The fourth was furnished and lighted with orange --the fifth with white --the sixth with violet.|12|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue.|13|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
But in this chamber only, the color of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations.|14|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
The panes here were scarlet --a deep blood color.|15|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
Now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof.|16|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers.|17|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
But in the corridors that followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier of fire that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room.|18|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances.|19|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
But in the western or black chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered, that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.|20|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western wall, a gigantic clock of ebony.|0|4|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
Its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause, momentarily, in their performance, to hearken to the sound; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the chimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew pale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused reverie or meditation.|1|4|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
But when the echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes, (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies,) there came yet another chiming of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before.|2|4|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel.|0|5|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
The tastes of the duke were peculiar.|1|5|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
He had a fine eye for colors and effects.|2|5|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
He disregarded the decora of mere fashion.|3|5|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror

He had directed, in great part, the moveable embellishments of the seven chambers, upon occasion of this great fete; and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders.|0|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
Be sure they were grotesque.|1|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
"There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasm --much of what has been since seen in ""Hernani""."|2|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror

To and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of dreams.|6|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
And these --the dreams --writhed in and about, taking hue from the rooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps.|7|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet.|8|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
And then, for a moment, all is still, and all is silent save the voice of the clock.|9|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
The dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand.|10|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
But the echoes of the chime die away --they have endured but an instant --and a light, half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart.|11|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
And now again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many-tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods.|12|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are now none of the maskers who venture; for the night is waning away; and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-colored panes; and the blackness of the sable drapery appals; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet, there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulge in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments.|13|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat feverishly the heart of life.|0|7|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
And the revel went whirlingly on, until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock.|1|7|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
And then the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before.|2|7|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with more of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled.|3|7|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
And thus, too, it happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before.|4|7|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
And the rumor of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at length from the whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of disapprobation and surprise --then, finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust.|5|7|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation.|0|8|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
In truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited; but the figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the bounds of even the prince's indefinite decorum.|1|8|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
There are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion.|2|8|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
Even with the utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are matters of which no jest can be made.|3|8|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
The whole company, indeed, seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed.|4|8|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
The figure was tall and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave.|5|8|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat.|6|8|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
And yet all this might have been endured, if not approved, by the mad revellers around.|7|8|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
But the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death.|8|8|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
His vesture was dabbled in blood --and his broad brow, with all the features of the face, was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.|9|8|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
When the eyes of Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (which with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its role, stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste; but, in the next, his brow reddened with rage.|0|9|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
"""Who dares""?"|0|10|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
"he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near him --""who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery?"|1|10|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
"Seize him and unmask him --that we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise, from the battlements""!"|2|10|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince Prospero as he uttered these words.|0|11|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
They rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly --for the prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand.|1|11|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of pale courtiers by his side.|0|12|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who at the moment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step, made closer approach to the speaker.|1|12|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
But from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party, there were found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince's person; and, while the vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first, through the blue chamber to the purple --through the purple to the green --through the green to the orange --through this again to the white --and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him.|2|12|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero, maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six chambers, while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all.|3|12|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer.|4|12|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
There was a sharp cry --and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in death the Prince Prospero.|5|12|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
Then, summoning the wild courage of despair, a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave-cerements and corpse-like mask which they handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.|6|12|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death.|0|13|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
He had come like a thief in the night.|1|13|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
And one by one dropped the revellers in the blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing posture of his fall.|2|13|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
And the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay.|3|13|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
And the flames of the tripods expired.|4|13|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all.|5|13|The Masque Of The Red Death|May 1842|Horror
The garden like a lady fair was cut That lay as if she slumbered in delight, And to the open skies her eyes did shut; The azure fields of heaven were 'sembled right In a large round set with flow'rs of light: The flowers de luce and the round sparks of dew That hung upon their azure leaves, did show Like twinkling stars that sparkle in the ev'ning blue.|0|0|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
NO MORE remarkable man ever lived than my friend, the young Ellison.|0|1|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
He was remarkable in the entire and continuous profusion of good gifts ever lavished upon him by fortune.|1|1|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
From his cradle to his grave, a gale of the blandest prosperity bore him along.|2|1|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Nor do I use the word Prosperity in its mere wordly or external sense.|3|1|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
I mean it as synonymous with happiness.|4|1|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
The person of whom I speak, seemed born for the purpose of foreshadowing the wild doctrines of Turgot, Price, Priestley, and Condorcet–of exemplifying, by individual instance, what has been deemed the mere chimera of the perfectionists.|5|1|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
In the brief existence of Ellison, I fancy, that I have seen refuted the dogma–that in man's physical and spiritual nature, lies some hidden principle, the antagonist of Bliss.|6|1|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
An intimate and anxious examination of his career, has taught me to understand that, in general, from the violation of a few simple laws of Humanity, arises the Wretchedness of mankind; that, as a species, we have in our possession the as yet unwrought elements of Content,–and that even now, in the present blindness and darkness of all idea on the great question of the Social Condition, it is not impossible that Man, the individual, under certain unusual and highly fortuitous conditions, may be happy.|7|1|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
With opinions such as these was my young friend fully imbued; and thus is it especially worthy of observation that the uninterrupted enjoyment which distinguished his life was in great part the result of preconcert.|0|2|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
It is, indeed evident, that with less of the instinctive philosophy which, now and then, stands so well in the stead of experience, Mr. Ellison would have found himself precipitated, by the very extraordinary successes of his life, into the common vortex of Unhappiness which yawns for those of preeminent endowments.|1|2|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
But it is by no means my present object to pen an essay on Happiness.|2|2|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
The ideas of my friend may be summed up in a few words.|3|2|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
He admitted but four unvarying laws, or rather elementary principles, of Bliss.|4|2|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
That which he considered chief, was (strange to say!|5|2|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
) the simple and purely physical one of free exercise in the open air.|6|2|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
"""The health,"" he said, ""attainable by other means than this is scarcely worth the name""."|7|2|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
He pointed to the tillers of the earth–the only people who, as a class, are proverbially more happy than others–and then he instanced the high ecstasies of the fox-hunter.|8|2|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
His second principle was the love of woman.|9|2|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
His third was the contempt of ambition.|10|2|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
His fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit; and he held that, other things being equal, the extent of happiness was proportioned to the spirituality of this object.|11|2|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
I have said that Ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts lavished upon him by Fortune.|0|3|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
In personal grace and beauty he exceeded all men.|1|3|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
His intellect was of that order to which the attainment of knowledge is less a labor than a necessity and an intuition.|2|3|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
His family was one of the most illustrious of the empire.|3|3|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
His bride was the loveliest and most devoted of women.|4|3|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
His possessions had been always ample; but, upon the attainment of his one and twentieth year, it was discovered that one of those extraordinary freaks of Fate had been played in his behalf which startle the whole social world amid which they occur, and seldom fail radically to alter the entire moral constitution of those who are their objects.|5|3|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
It appears that about one hundred years prior to Mr. Ellison's attainment of his majority, there had died, in a remote province, one Mr. Seabright Ellison.|6|3|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
This gentlemen had amassed a princely fortune, and, having no very immediate connexions, conceived the whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate for a century after his decease.|7|3|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Minutely and sagaciously directing the various modes of investment, he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the nearest of blood, bearing the name Ellison, who should be alive at the end of the hundred years.|8|3|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Many futile attempts had been made to set aside this singular bequest; their ex post facto character rendered them abortive; but the attention of a jealous government was aroused, and a decree finally obtained, forbidding all similar accumulations.|9|3|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
This act did not prevent young Ellison, upon his twenty-first birth-day, from entering into possession, as the heir of his ancestor, Seabright, of a fortune of four hundred and fifty millions of dollars.|10|3|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
* An incident similar in outline to the one here imagined, occurred, not very long ago, in England.|0|4|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
The name of the fortunate heir (who still lives,) is Thelluson.|1|4|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
"I first saw an account of this matter in the ""Tour"" of Prince Puckler Muskau."|2|4|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
"He makes the sum received ninety millions of pounds, and observes, with much force, that, ""in the contemplation of so vast a sum, and of the services, to which it might be applied, there is something even of the sublime""."|3|4|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
To suit the views of this article, I have followed the Prince's statement–a grossly exaggerated one, no doubt.|4|4|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
When it had become definitely known that such was the enormous wealth inherited, there were, of course, many speculations as to the mode of its disposal.|0|5|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
The gigantic magnitude and the immediately available nature of the sum, dazzled and bewildered all who thought upon the topic.|1|5|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
The possessor of any appreciable amount of money might have been imagined to perform any one of a thousand things.|2|5|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
With riches merely surpassing those of any citizen, it would have been easy to suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionable extravagances of his time; or busying himself with political intrigues; or aiming at ministerial power, or purchasing increase of nobility, or devising gorgeous architectural piles; or collecting large specimens of Virtu; or playing the munificent patron of Letters and Art; or endowing and bestowing his name upon extensive institutions of charity.|3|5|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
But, for the inconceivable wealth in the actual possession of the young heir, these objects and all ordinary objects were felt to be inadequate.|4|5|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Recourse was had to figures; and figures but sufficed to confound.|5|5|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
It was seen, that even at three per cent, the annual income of the inheritance amounted to no less than thirteen millions and five hundred thousand dollars; which was one million and one hundred and twenty-five thousand per month; or thirty-six thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six per day, or one thousand five hundred and forty-one per hour, or six and twenty dollars for every minute that flew.|6|5|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Thus the usual track of supposition was thoroughly broken up.|7|5|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Men knew not what to imagine.|8|5|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
There were some who even conceived that Mr. Ellison would divest himself forthwith of at least two-thirds of his fortune as of utterly superfluous opulence; enriching whole troops of his relatives by division of his superabundance.|9|5|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
I was not surprised, however, to perceive that he had long made up his mind upon a topic which had occasioned so much of discussion to his friends.|0|6|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Nor was I greatly astonished at the nature of his decision.|1|6|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
In the widest and noblest sense, he was a poet.|2|6|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
He comprehended, moreover, the true character, the august aims, the supreme majesty and dignity of the poetic sentiment.|3|6|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
The proper gratification of the sentiment he instinctively felt to lie in the creation of novel forms of Beauty.|4|6|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Some peculiarities, either in his early education, or in the nature of his intellect, had tinged with what is termed materialism the whole cast of his ethical speculations; and it was this bias, perhaps, which imperceptibly led him to perceive that the most advantageous, if not the sole legitimate field for the exercise of the poetic sentiment, was to be found in the creation of novel moods of purely physical loveliness.|5|6|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Thus it happened that he became neither musician nor poet; if we use this latter term in its every–day acceptation.|6|6|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Or it might have been that he became neither the one nor the other, in pursuance of an idea of his which I have already mentioned–the idea, that in the contempt of ambition lay one of the essential principles of happiness on earth.|7|6|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Is it not, indeed, possible that while a high order of genius is necessarily ambitious, the highest is invariably above that which is termed ambition?|8|6|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
"And may it not thus happen that many far greater than Milton, have contentedly remained ""mute and inglorious""?"|9|6|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
I believe the world has never yet seen, and that, unless through some series of accidents goading the noblest order of mind into distasteful exertion, the world will never behold, that full extent of triumphant execution, in the richer productions of Art, of which the human nature is absolutely capable.|10|6|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Mr. Ellison became neither musician nor poet; although no man lived more profoundly enamored both of Music and the Muse.|0|7|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Under other circumstances than those which invested him, it is not impossible that he would have become a painter.|1|7|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
The field of sculpture, although in its nature rigidly poetical, was too limited in its extent and in its consequences, to have occupied, at any time, much of his attention.|2|7|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
And I have now mentioned all the provinces in which even the most liberal understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared this sentiment capable of expatiating.|3|7|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
"I mean the most liberal public or recognized conception of the idea involved in the phrase ""poetic sentiment""."|4|7|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
But Mr. Ellison imagined that the richest, and altogether the most natural and most suitable province, had been blindly neglected.|5|7|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
No definition had spoken of the Landscape-Gardener, as of the poet; yet my friend could not fail to perceive that the creation of the Landscape-Garden offered to the true muse the most magnificent of opportunities.|6|7|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Here was, indeed, the fairest field for the display of invention, or imagination, in the endless combining of forms of novel Beauty; the elements which should enter into combination being, at all times, and by a vast superiority, the most glorious which the earth could afford.|7|7|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
In the multiform of the tree, and in the multicolor of the flower, he recognized the most direct and the most energetic efforts of Nature at physical loveliness.|8|7|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
And in the direction or concentration of this effort, or, still more properly, in its adaption to the eyes which were to behold it upon earth, he perceived that he should be employing the best means- laboring to the greatest advantage–in the fulfilment of his destiny as Poet.|9|7|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
"""Its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it upon earth""."|0|8|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
In his explanation of this phraseology, Mr. Ellison did much towards solving what has always seemed to me an enigma.|1|8|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
I mean the fact (which none but the ignorant dispute,) that no such combinations of scenery exist in Nature as the painter of genius has in his power to produce.|2|8|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
No such Paradises are to be found in reality as have glowed upon the canvass of Claude.|3|8|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
In the most enchanting of natural landscapes, there will always be found a defect or an excess–many excesses and defects.|4|8|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
While the component parts may exceed, individually, the highest skill of the artist, the arrangement of the parts will always be susceptible of improvement.|5|8|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
In short, no position can be attained, from which an artistical eye, looking steadily, will not find matter of offence, in what is technically termed the composition of a natural landscape.|6|8|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
And yet how unintelligible is this!|7|8|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
In all other matters we are justly instructed to regard Nature as supreme.|8|8|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
With her details we shrink from competition.|9|8|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Who shall presume to imitate the colors of the tulip, or to improve the proportions of the lily of the valley?|10|8|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
"The criticism which says, of sculpture or of portraiture, that ""Nature is to be exalted rather than imitated,"" is in error."|11|8|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
No pictorial or sculptural combinations of points of human loveliness, do more than approach the living and breathing human beauty as it gladdens our daily path.|12|8|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Than all the nonsense of their stone ideal.|0|10|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
In landscape alone is the principle of the critic true; and, having felt its truth here, it is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has induced him to pronounce it true throughout all the domains of Art.|0|11|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Having, I say, felt its truth here.|1|11|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
For the feeling is no affectation or chimera.|2|11|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
The mathematics afford no more absolute demonstrations, than the sentiment of his Art yields to the artist.|3|11|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
He not only believes, but positively knows, that such and such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter, or form, constitute, and alone constitute, the true Beauty.|4|11|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Yet his reasons have not yet been matured into expression.|5|11|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
It remains for a more profound analysis than the world has yet seen, fully to investigate and express them.|6|11|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Nevertheless is he confirmed in his instinctive opinions, by the concurrence of all his compeers.|7|11|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Let a composition be defective, let an emendation be wrought in its mere arrangement of form; let this emendation be submitted to every artist in the world; by each will its necessity be admitted.|8|11|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
And even far more than this, in remedy of the defective composition, each insulated member of the fraternity will suggest the identical emendation.|9|11|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
"I repeat that in landscape arrangements, or collocations alone, is the physical Nature susceptible of ""exaltation"" and that, therefore, her susceptibility of improvement at this one point, was a mystery which, hitherto I had been unable to solve."|0|12|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
It was Mr. Ellison who first suggested the idea that what we regarded as improvement or exaltation of the natural beauty, was really such, as respected only the mortal or human point of view; that each alteration or disturbance of the primitive scenery might possibly effect a blemish in the picture, if we could suppose this picture viewed at large from some remote point in the heavens.|1|12|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
"""It is easily understood,"" says Mr. Ellison, ""that what might improve a closely scrutinized detail, might, at the same time, injure a general and more distantly–observed effect""."|2|12|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
He spoke upon this topic with warmth: regarding not so much its immediate or obvious importance, (which is little,) as the character of the conclusions to which it might lead, or of the collateral propositions which it might serve to corroborate or sustain.|3|12|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
There might be a class of beings, human once, but now to humanity invisible, for whose scrutiny and for whose refined appreciation of the beautiful, more especially than for our own, had been set in order by God the great landscape-garden of the whole earth.|4|12|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
In the course of our discussion, my young friend took occasion to quote some passages from a writer who has been supposed to have well treated this theme.|0|13|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
"""There are, properly,"" he writes, ""but two styles of landscape-gardening, the natural and the artificial."|0|14|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
One seeks to recall the original beauty of the country, by adapting its means to the surrounding scenery; cultivating trees in harmony with the hills or plain of the neighboring land; detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size, proportion and color which, hid from the common observer, are revealed everywhere to the experienced student of nature.|1|14|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
The result of the natural style of gardening, is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities–in the prevalence of a beautiful harmony and order, than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles.|2|14|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
The artificial style has as many varieties as there are different tastes to gratify.|3|14|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
It has a certain general relation to the various styles of building.|4|14|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
There are the stately avenues and retirements of Versailles; Italian terraces; and a various mixed old English style, which bears some relation to the domestic Gothic or English Elizabethan architecture.|5|14|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Whatever may be said against the abuses of the artificial landscape-gardening, a mixture of pure art in a garden scene, adds to it a great beauty.|6|14|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
This is partly pleasing to the eye, by the show of order and design, and partly moral.|7|14|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
A terrace, with an old moss-covered balustrade, calls up at once to the eye, the fair forms that have passed there in other days.|8|14|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
"The slightest exhibition of art is an evidence of care and human interest""."|9|14|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
"""From what I have already observed,"" said Mr. Ellison, ""you will understand that I reject the idea, here expressed, of 'recalling the original beauty of the country."|0|15|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
' The original beauty is never so great as that which may be introduced.|1|15|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Of course, much depends upon the selection of a spot with capabilities.|2|15|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
What is said in respect to the 'detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size, proportion and color,' is a mere vagueness of speech, which may mean much, or little, or nothing, and which guides in no degree.|3|15|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
That the true 'result of the natural style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities, than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles,' is a proposition better suited to the grovelling apprehension of the herd, than to the fervid dreams of the man of genius.|4|15|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
The merit suggested is, at best, negative, and appertains to that hobbling criticism which, in letters, would elevate Addison into apotheosis.|5|15|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
In truth, while that merit which consists in the mere avoiding demerit, appeals directly to the understanding, and can thus be foreshadowed in Rule, the loftier merit, which breathes and flames in invention or creation, can be apprehended solely in its results.|6|15|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Rule applies but to the excellences of avoidance–to the virtues which deny or refrain.|7|15|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
Beyond these the critical art can but suggest.|8|15|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
We may be instructed to build an Odyssey, but it is in vain that we are told how to conceive a 'Tempest,' an 'Inferno,' a 'Prometheus Bound,' a 'Nightingale,' such as that of Keats, or the 'Sensitive Plant' of Shelley.|9|15|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
But, the thing done, the wonder accomplished, and the capacity for apprehension becomes universal.|10|15|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
The sophists of the negative school, who, through inability to create, have scoffed at creation, are now found the loudest in applause.|11|15|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
What, in its chrysalis condition of principle, affronted their demure reason, never fails, in its maturity of accomplishment, to extort admiration from their instinct of the beautiful or of the sublime.|12|15|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
"""Our author's observations on the artificial style of gardening,"" continued Mr. Ellison, ""are less objectionable."|0|16|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
'A mixture of pure art in a garden scene, adds to it a great beauty.|1|16|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
' This is just; and the reference to the sense of human interest is equally so.|2|16|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
I repeat that the principle here expressed, is incontrovertible; but there may be something even beyond it.|3|16|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
There may be an object in full keeping with the principle suggested–an object unattainable by the means ordinarily in possession of mankind, yet which, if attained, would lend a charm to the landscape-garden immeasurably surpassing that which a merely human interest could bestow.|4|16|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
The true poet possessed of very unusual pecuniary resources, might possibly, while retaining the necessary idea of art or interest or culture, so imbue his designs at once with extent and novelty of Beauty, as to convey the sentiment of spiritual interference.|5|16|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
It will be seen that, in bringing about such result, he secures all the advantages of interest or design, while relieving his work of all the harshness and technicality of Art.|6|16|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
In the most rugged of wildernesses–in the most savage of the scenes of pure Nature–there is apparent the art of a Creator; yet is this art apparent only to reflection; in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling.|7|16|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
"Now, if we imagine this sense of the Almighty Design to be harmonized in a measurable degree, if we suppose a landscape whose combined strangeness, vastness, definitiveness, and magnificence, shall inspire the idea of culture, or care, or superintendence, on the part of intelligences superior yet akin to humanity–then the sentiment of interest is preserved, while the Art is made to assume the air of an intermediate or secondary Nature–a Nature which is not God, nor an emanation of God, but which still is Nature, in the sense that it is the handiwork of the angels that hover between man and God""."|8|16|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
It was in devoting his gigantic wealth to the practical embodiment of a vision such as this–in the free exercise in the open air, which resulted from personal direction of his plans–in the continuous and unceasing object which these plans afford–in the contempt of ambition which it enabled him more to feel than to affect–and, lastly, it was in the companionship and sympathy of a devoted wife, that Ellison thought to find, and found, an exemption from the ordinary cares of Humanity, with a far greater amount of positive happiness than ever glowed in the rapt day-dreams of De Stael.|0|17|The Landscape Garden|October 1842|Sketch
There are ideal series of events which run parallel with the real ones.|0|0|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
They rarely coincide.|1|0|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Men and circumstances generally modify the ideal train of events, so that it seems imperfect, and its consequences are equally imperfect.|2|0|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

"Upon the original publication of ""Marie Roget,"" the footnotes now appended were considered unnecessary; but the lapse of several years since the tragedy upon which the tale is based, renders it expedient to give them, and also to say a few words in explanation of the general design."|0|2|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
A young girl, Mary Cecilia Rogers, was murdered in the vicinity of New York; and although her death occasioned an intense and long-enduring excitement, the mystery attending it had remained unsolved at the period when the present paper was written and published (November, 1842).|1|2|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Herein, under pretence of relating the fate of a Parisian grisette, the author has followed, in minute detail, the essential, while merely paralleling the inessential, facts of the real murder of Mary Rogers.|2|2|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Thus all argument founded upon the fiction is applicable to the truth: and the investigation of the truth was the object.|3|2|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"The ""Mystery of Marie Roget"" was composed at a distance from the scene of the atrocity, and with no other means of investigation than the newspapers afforded."|0|3|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Thus much escaped the writer of which he could have availed himself had he been upon the spot and visited the localities.|1|3|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It may not be improper to record, nevertheless, that the confessions of two persons (one of them the Madame Deluc of the narrative), made, at different periods, long subsequent to the publication, confirmed, in full, not only the general conclusion, but absolutely all the chief hypothetical details by which that conclusion was attained.|2|3|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
THERE ARE few persons, even among the calmest thinkers, who have not occasionally been startled into a vague yet thrilling half-credence in the supernatural, by coincidences of so seemingly marvellous a character that, as mere coincidences, the intellect has been unable to receive them.|0|4|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Such sentiments–for the half-credences of which I speak have never the full force of thought–such sentiments are seldom thoroughly stifled unless by reference to the doctrine of chance, or, as it is technically termed, the Calculus of Probabilities.|1|4|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Now this Calculus is, in its essence, purely mathematical; and thus we have the anomaly of the most rigidly exact in science applied to the shadow and spirituality of the most intangible in speculation.|2|4|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The extraordinary details which I am now called upon to make public, will be found to form, as regards sequence of time, the primary branch of a series of scarcely intelligible coincidences, whose secondary or concluding branch will be recognized by all readers in the late murder of MARY CECILIA ROGERS, at New York.|0|5|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"When, in an article entitled ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue,"" I endeavored, about a year ago, to depict some very remarkable features in the mental character of my friend, the Chevalier C. Auguste Dupin, it did not occur to me that I should ever resume the subject."|0|6|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
This depicting of character constituted my design; and this design was thoroughly fulfilled in the wild train of circumstances brought to instance Dupin's idiosyncrasy.|1|6|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
I might have adduced other examples, but I should have proven no more.|2|6|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Late events, however, in their surprising development, have startled me into some farther details, which will carry with them the air of extorted confession.|3|6|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Hearing what I have lately heard, it would be indeed strange should I remain silent in regard to what I both heard and saw so long ago.|4|6|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Upon the winding up of the tragedy involved in the deaths of Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter, the Chevalier dismissed the affair at once from his attention, and relapsed into his old habits of moody revery.|0|7|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Prone, at all times, to abstraction, I readily fell in with his humor; and continuing to occupy our chambers in the Faubourg Saint Germain, we gave the Future to the winds, and slumbered tranquilly in the Present, weaving the dull world around us into dreams.|1|7|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But these dreams were not altogether uninterrupted.|0|8|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It may readily be supposed that the part played by my friend, in the drama at the Rue Morgue had not failed of its impression upon the fancies of the Parisian police.|1|8|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
With its emissaries, the name of Dupin had grown into a household word.|2|8|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The simple character of those inductions by which he had disentangled the mystery never having been explained even to the Prefect, or to any other individual than myself, of course it is not surprising that the affair was regarded as little less than miraculous, or that the Chevalier's analytical abilities acquired for him the credit of intuition.|3|8|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
His frankness would have led him to disabuse every inquirer of such prejudice; but his indolent humor forbade all further agitation of a topic whose interest to himself had long ceased.|4|8|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It thus happened that he found himself the cynosure of the political eyes; and the cases were not few in which attempt was made to engage his services at the Prefecture.|5|8|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
One of the most remarkable instances was that of the murder of a young girl named Marie Roget.|6|8|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
This event occurred about two years after the atrocity in the Rue Morgue.|0|9|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"Marie, whose Christian and family name will at once arrest attention from their resemblance to those of the unfortunate ""cigar-girl"" was the only daughter of the widow Estelle Roget."|1|9|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The father had died during the child's infancy, and from the period of his death, until within eighteen months before the assassination which forms the subject of our narrative, the mother and daughter had dwelt together in the Rue Pavee Saint Andree;* Madame there keeping a pension, assisted by Marie.|2|9|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Affairs went on thus until the latter had attained her twenty-second year, when her great beauty attracted the notice of a perfumer, who occupied one of the shops in the basement of the Palais Royal, and whose custom lay, chiefly among the desperate adventurers infesting that neighborhood.|3|9|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Monsieur Le Blanc*(2) was not unaware of the advantages to be derived from the attendance of the fair Marie in his perfumery; and his liberal proposals were accepted eagerly by the girl, although with somewhat more of hesitation by Madame.|4|9|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The anticipations of the shopkeeper were realized, and his rooms soon became notorious through the charms of the sprightly grisette.|0|12|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
She had been in his employ about a year, when her admirers were thrown into confusion by her sudden disappearance from the shop.|1|12|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Monsieur Le Blanc was unable to account for her absence, and Madame Roget was distracted with anxiety and terror.|2|12|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The public papers immediately took up the theme, and the police were upon the point of making serious investigations, when, one fine morning, after the lapse of a week, Marie, in good health, but with a somewhat saddened air, made her re-appearance at her usual counter in the perfumery.|3|12|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
All inquiry, except that of a private character, was of course, immediately hushed.|4|12|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Monsieur Le Blanc professed total ignorance, as before.|5|12|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Marie, with Madame, replied to all questions, that the last week had been spent at the house of a relation in the country.|6|12|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Thus the affair died away, and was generally forgotten; for the girl, ostensibly to relieve herself from the impertinence of curiosity soon bade a final adieu to the perfumer, and sought the shelter of her mother's residence in the Rue Pavee Saint Andree.|7|12|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It was about five months after this return home, that her friends were alarmed by her sudden disappearance for the second time.|0|13|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Three days elapsed, and nothing was heard of her.|1|13|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
On the fourth her corpse was found floating in the Seine* near the shore which is opposite the Quartier of the Rue Saint Andre, and at a point not very far distant from the secluded neighborhood of the Barriere du Roule.|2|13|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The atrocity of this murder (for it was at once evident that murder had been committed), the youth and beauty of the victim, and, above all her previous notoriety, conspired to produce intense excitement in the minds of the sensitive Parisians.|0|16|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
I can call to mind no similar occurrence producing so general and so intense an effect.|1|16|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
For several weeks, in the discussion of this one absorbing theme, even the momentous political topics of the day were forgotten.|2|16|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The Prefect made unusual exertions; and the powers of the whole Parisian police were, of course, tasked to the utmost extent.|3|16|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Upon the first discovery of the corpse, it was not supposed that the murderer would be able to elude, for more than a very brief period, the inquisition which was immediately set on foot.|0|17|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It was not until the expiration of a week that it was deemed necessary to offer a reward; and even then this reward was limited to a thousand francs.|1|17|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
In the meantime the investigation proceeded with vigor, if not always with judgment, and numerous individuals were examined to no purpose; while, owing to the continual absence of all clew to the mystery, the popular excitement greatly increased.|2|17|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"At the end of the tenth day it was thought advisable to double the sum originally proposed; and, at length, the second week having elapsed without leading to any discoveries, and the prejudice which always exists in Paris against the Police having given vent to itself in several serious emeutes, the Prefect took it upon himself to offer the sum of twenty thousand francs ""for the conviction of the assassin,"" or, if more than one should prove to have been implicated, ""for the conviction of any one of the assassins""."|3|17|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
In the proclamation setting forth this reward, a full pardon was promised to any accomplice who should come forward in evidence against his fellow; and to the whole was appended, wherever it appeared, the private placard of a committee of citizens, offering ten thousand francs, in addition to the amount proposed by the Prefecture.|4|17|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The entire reward thus stood at no less than thirty thousand francs, which will be regarded as an extraordinary sum when we consider the humble condition of the girl, and the great frequency, in large cities, of such atrocities as the one described.|5|17|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
No one doubted now that the mystery of this murder would be immediately brought to light.|0|18|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But although, in one or two instances, arrests were made which promised elucidation, yet nothing was elicited which could implicate the parties suspected; and they were discharged forthwith.|1|18|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Strange as it may appear, the third week from the discovery of the body had passed, and passed without any light being thrown upon the subject, before even a rumor of the events which had so agitated the public mind reached the ears of Dupin and myself.|2|18|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Engaged in researches which had absorbed our whole attention, it had been nearly a month since either of us had gone abroad, or received a visitor, or more than glanced at the leading political articles in one of the daily papers.|3|18|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The first intelligence of the murder was brought us by G--, in person.|4|18|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
He called upon us early in the afternoon of the thirteenth of July, 18-, and remained with us until late in the night.|5|18|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
He had been piqued by the failure of all his endeavors to ferret out the assassins.|6|18|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
His reputation–so he said with a peculiarly Parisian air–was at stake.|7|18|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Even his honor was concerned.|8|18|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The eyes of the public were upon him; and there was really no sacrifice which he would not be willing to make for the development of the mystery.|9|18|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
He concluded a somewhat droll speech with a compliment upon what he was pleased to term the tact of Dupin, and made him a direct and certainly a liberal proposition, the precise nature of which I do not feel myself at liberty to disclose, but which has no bearing upon the proper subject of my narrative.|10|18|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The compliment my friend rebutted as best he could, but the proposition he accepted at once, although its advantages were altogether provisional.|0|19|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
This point being settled, the Prefect broke forth at once into explanations of his own views, interspersing them with long comments upon the evidence; of which latter we were not yet in possession.|1|19|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
He discoursed much and, beyond doubt, learnedly; while I hazarded an occasional suggestion as the night wore drowsily away.|2|19|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Dupin, sitting steadily in his accustomed armchair, was the embodiment of respectful attention.|3|19|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
He wore spectacles, during the whole interview; and an occasional glance beneath their green glasses sufficed to convince me that he slept not the less soundly, because silently, throughout the seven or eight leaden-footed hours which immediately preceded the departure of the Prefect.|4|19|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
In the morning, I procured, at the Prefecture, a full report of all the evidence elicited, and, at the various newspaper offices, a copy of every paper in which, from first to last, had been published any decisive information in regard to this sad affair.|0|20|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Marie Roget left the residence of her mother, in the Rue Pavee St. Andree, about nine o'clock in the morning of Sunday, June the twenty second, 18-.|0|21|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
In going out, she gave notice to a Monsieur Jacques St. Eustache,* and to him only, of her intention to spend the day with an aunt, who resided in the Rue des Dromes.|1|21|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The Rue des Dromes is a short and narrow but populous thoroughfare, not far from the banks of the river, and at a distance of some two miles, in the most direct course possible, from the pension of Madame Roget.|2|21|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
St. Eustache was the accepted suitor of Marie, and lodged, as well as took his meals, at the pension.|3|21|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
He was to have gone for his betrothed at dusk, and to have escorted her home.|4|21|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
In the afternoon, however, it came on to rain heavily; and, supposing that she would remain all night at her aunt's (as she had done under similar circumstances before), he did not think it necessary to keep his promise.|5|21|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"As night drew on, Madame Roget (who was an infirm old lady, seventy years of age) was heard to express a fear ""that she should never see Marie again;"" but this observation attracted little attention at the time."|6|21|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
On Monday it was ascertained that the girl had not been to the Rue des Dromes; and when the day elapsed without tidings of her, a tardy search was instituted at several points in the city and its environs.|0|23|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It was not, however, until the fourth day from the period of her disappearance that any thing satisfactory was ascertained respecting her.|1|23|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
On this day (Wednesday, the twenty-fifth of June) a Monsieur Beauvais,* who, with a friend, had been making inquiries for Marie near the Barriere du Roule, on the shore of the Seine which is opposite the Rue Pavee St. Andree, was informed that a corpse had just been towed ashore by some fishermen, who had found it floating in the river.|2|23|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Upon seeing the body, Beauvais, after some hesitation, identified it as that of the perfumery-girl.|3|23|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
His friend recognized it more promptly.|4|23|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The face was suffused with dark blood, some of which issued from the mouth.|0|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
No foam was seen, as in the case of the merely drowned.|1|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
There was no discoloration in the cellular tissue.|2|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
About the throat were bruises and impressions of fingers.|3|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The arms were bent over on the chest, and were rigid.|4|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The right hand was clenched; the left partially open.|5|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
On the left wrist were two circular excoriations, apparently the effect of ropes, or of a rope in more than one volution.|6|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
A part of the right wrist, also, was much chafed, as well as the back throughout its extent, but more especially at the shoulder-blades.|7|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
In bringing the body to the shore the fishermen had attached to it a rope, but none of the excorations had been effected by this.|8|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The flesh of the neck was much swollen.|9|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
There were no cuts apparent, or bruises which appeared the effect of blows.|10|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
A piece of lace was found tied so tightly around the neck as to be hidden from sight; it was completely buried in the flesh, and was fastened by a knot which lay just under the left ear.|11|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
This alone would have sufficed to produce death.|12|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The medical testimony spoke confidently of the virtuous character of the deceased.|13|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
She had been subjected, it said, to brutal violence.|14|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The corpse was in such condition when found, that there could have been no difficulty in its recognition by friends.|15|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The dress was much torn and otherwise disordered.|0|26|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
In the outer garment, a slip, about a foot wide, had been torn upward from the bottom hem to the waist, but not torn off.|1|26|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It was wound three times around the waist, and secured by a sort of hitch in the back.|2|26|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The dress immediately beneath the frock was of fine muslin; and from this a slip eighteen inches wide had been torn entirely out-torn very evenly and with great care.|3|26|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It was found around her neck, fitting loosely, and secured with a hard knot.|4|26|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Over this muslin slip and the slip of lace the strings of a bonnet were attached, the bonnet being appended.|5|26|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The knot by which the strings of the bonnet were fastened was not a lady's, but a slip or sailors knot.|6|26|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
After the recognition of the corpse, it was not, as usual, taken to the Morgue (this formality being superfluous), but hastily interred not far from the spot at which it was brought ashore.|0|27|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Through the exertions of Beauvais, the matter was industriously hushed up, as far as possible; and several days had elapsed before any public emotion resulted.|1|27|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
A weekly paper,* however, at length took up the theme; the corpse was disinterred, and a re-examination instituted; but nothing was elicited beyond what has been already noted.|2|27|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The clothes, however, were now submitted to the mother and friends of the deceased, and fully identified as those worn by the girl upon leaving home.|3|27|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

Meantime, the excitement increased hourly.|0|29|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Several individuals were arrested and discharged.|1|29|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
St. Eustache fell especially under suspicion; and he failed, at first, to give an intelligible account of his whereabouts during the Sunday on which Marie left home.|2|29|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Subsequently, however, he submitted to Monsieur G--, affidavits, accounting satisfactorily for every hour of the day in question.|3|29|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
As time passed and no discovery ensued, a thousand contradictory rumors were circulated and journalists busied themselves in suggestions.|4|29|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Among these, the one which attracted the most notice, was the idea that Marie Roget still lived–that the corpse found in the Seine was that of some other unfortunate.|5|29|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It will be proper that I submit to the reader some passages which embody the suggestion alluded to.|6|29|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
These passages are literal translations from L'Etoile,* a paper conducted, in general, with much ability.|7|29|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

There is no trace or tidings of her at all.|2|31|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
There has no person, whatever, come forward, so far, who saw her at all in that day, after she left her mother's door.|6|31|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Now, though we have no evidence that Marie Roget was in the land of the living after nine o'clock on Sunday, June the twenty-second, we have proof that, up to that hour, she was alive.|10|31|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
On Wednesday noon, at twelve, a female body was discovered afloat on the shore of the Barriere du Roule.|11|31|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
This was, even if we presume that Marie Roget was thrown into the river within three hours after she left her mother's house, only three days from the time she left her home–three days to an hour.|12|31|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But it is folly to suppose that the murder, if murder was committed on her body, could have been consummated soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight.|13|31|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Those who are guilty of such horrid crimes choose darkness rather than light.|14|31|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Thus we see that if the body found in the river was that of Marie Roget it could only have been in the water two and a half days, or three at the outside.|17|31|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
All experience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence, require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water.|18|31|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Even where a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises before at least five or six days' immersion, it sinks again, if left alone.|19|31|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Now, we ask, what was there in this case to cause a departure from the ordinary course of nature?|20|31|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
If the body had been kept in its mangled state on shore until Tuesday night some trace would be found in shore of the murderers.|24|31|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It is a doubtful point, also, whether the body would be so soon afloat, even were it thrown in after having been dead two days.|25|31|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"And, furthermore, it is exceedingly improbable that any villains who had committed such a murder as is here supposed, would have thrown the body in without weight to sink it, when such a precaution could have so easily been taken""."|26|31|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"The editor here proceeds to argue that the body must have been in the water ""not three days merely, but, at least, five times three days,"" because it was so far decomposed that Beauvais had great difficulty in recognizing it."|0|32|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
This latter point, however, was fully disproved.|1|32|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""What, then, are the facts on which M. Beauvais says that he had no doubt the body was that of Marie Roget?"|0|33|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
He ripped up the gown sleeve, and says he found marks which satisfied him of the identity.|1|33|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The public generally supposed those marks to have consisted of some description of scars.|2|33|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
He rubbed the arm and found hair upon it- something as indefinite, we think, as can readily be imagined–as little conclusive as finding an arm in the sleeve.|3|33|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
M. Beauvais did not return that night, but sent word to Madame Roget, at seven o'clock, on Wednesday evening, that an investigation was still in progress respecting her daughter.|4|33|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
If we allow that Madame Roget, from her age and grief, could not go over (which is allowing a great deal), there certainly must have been some one who would have thought it worth while to go over and attend the investigation, if they thought the body was that of Marie.|5|33|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Nobody went over.|6|33|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
There was nothing said or heard about the matter in the Rue Pavee St. Andree, that reached even the occupants of the same building.|7|33|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
M. St. Eustache, the lover and intended husband of Marie, who boarded in her mother's house, deposes that he did not hear of the discovery of the body of his intended until the next morning, when M. Beauvais came into his chamber and told him of it.|8|33|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"For an item of news like this, it strikes us it was very coolly received""."|9|33|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
In this way the journal endeavored to create the impression of an apathy on the part of the relatives of Marie, inconsistent with the supposition that these relatives believed the corpse to be hers.|0|34|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Its insinuations amount to this:–that Marie, with the connivance of her friends, had absented herself from the city for reasons involving a charge against her chastity; and that these friends upon the discovery of a corpse in the Seine, somewhat resembling that of the girl, had availed themselves of the opportunity to impress the public with the belief of her death.|1|34|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But L'Etoile was again overhasty.|2|34|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It was distinctly proved that no apathy, such as was imagined, existed; that the old lady was exceedingly feeble, and so agitated as to be unable to attend to any duty; that St. Eustache, so far from receiving the news coolly, was distracted with grief, and bore himself so frantically, that M. Beauvais prevailed upon a friend and relative to take charge of him, and prevent his attending the examination at the disinterment.|3|34|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Moreover, although it was stated by L'Etoile, that the corpse was re-interred at the public expense,–that an advantageous offer of private sepulture was absolutely declined by the family,–and that no member of the family attended the ceremonial:- although, I say, all this was asserted by L'Etoile in furtherance of the impression it designed to convey–yet all this was satisfactorily disproved.|4|34|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
In a subsequent number of the paper, an attempt was made to throw suspicion upon Beauvais himself.|5|34|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""Now, then, a change comes over the matter."|0|35|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
We are told that, on one occasion, while a Madame B–was at Madame Roget's house, M. Beauvais, who was going out, told her that a gendarme was expected there, and that she, Madame B., must not say any thing to the gendarme until he returned, but let the matter be for him.|1|35|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
In the present posture of affairs, M. Beauvais appears to have the whole matter locked up in his head.|5|35|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
A single step cannot be taken without M. Beauvais, for, go which way you will you run against him.|6|35|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
For some reason he determined that nobody shall have anything to do with the proceedings but himself, and he has elbowed the male relatives out of the way, according to their representations, in a very singular manner.|10|35|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"He seems to have been very much averse to permitting the relatives to see the body""."|11|35|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
By the following fact, some color was given to the suspicion thus thrown upon Beauvais.|0|36|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"A visitor at his office, a few days prior to the girl's disappearance, and during the absence of its occupant, had observed a rose in the key-hole of the door, and the name ""Marie"" inscribed upon a slate which hung near at hand."|1|36|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The general impression, so far as we were enabled to glean it from the newspapers, seemed to be, that Marie had been the victim of a gang of desperadoes–that by these she had been borne across the river, maltreated, and murdered.|0|37|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Le Commerciel,* however, a print of extensive influence, was earnest in combatting this popular idea.|1|37|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""We are persuaded that pursuit has hitherto been on a false scent, so far as it has been directed to the Barriere du Roule."|0|39|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It is impossible that a person so well known to thousands as this young woman was, should have passed three blocks without some one having seen her; and any one who saw her would have remembered it, for she interested all who knew her.|1|39|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It was when the streets were full of people, when she went out.|2|39|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It is impossible that she could have gone to the Barriere du Roule, or to the Rue des Dromes, without being recognized by a dozen persons; yet no one has come forward who saw her outside of her mother's door, and there is no evidence, except the testimony concerning her expressed intentions, that she did go out at all.|6|39|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Her gown was torn, bound round her, and tied; and by that the body was carried as a bundle.|7|39|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
If the murder had been committed at the Barriere du Roule, there would have been no necessity for any such arrangement.|8|39|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The fact that the body was found floating near the Barriere, is no proof as to where it was thrown into the water.|9|39|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
A piece of one of the unfortunate girl's petticoats, two feet long and one foot wide, was torn out and tied under her chin around the back of her head, probably to prevent screams.|13|39|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"This was done by fellows who had no pocket-handkerchief""."|14|39|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
A day or two before the Prefect called upon us, however, some important information reached the police, which seemed to overthrow, at least, the chief portion of Le Commerciel's argument.|0|40|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Two small boys, sons of a Madame Deluc, while roaming among the woods near the Barriere du Roule, chanced to penetrate a close thicket, within which were three or four large stones, forming a kind of seat with a back and footstool.|1|40|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
On the upper stone lay a white petticoat; on the second, a silk scarf.|2|40|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
A parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief were also here found.|3|40|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

The earth was trampled, the bushes were broken, and there was every evidence of a struggle.|6|40|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Between the thicket and the river, the fences were found taken down, and the ground bore evidence of some heavy burthen having been dragged along it.|7|40|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

The silk on the parasol was strong, but the threads of it were run together within.|2|43|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The upper part, where it had been doubled and folded, was all mildewed and rotten, and tore on its being opened.|3|43|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The pieces of her frock torn out by the bushes were about three inches wide and six inches long.|7|43|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
One part was the hem of the frock, and it had been mended; the other piece was part of the skirt, not the hem.|8|43|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

"There can be no doubt, therefore, that the spot of this appalling outrage has been discovered""."|13|43|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Consequent upon this discovery, new evidence appeared.|0|44|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Madame Deluc testified that she keeps a roadside inn not far from the bank of the river, opposite the Barriere du Roule.|1|44|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The neighborhood is secluded–particularly so.|2|44|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It is the usual Sunday resort of blackguards from the city, who cross the river in boats.|3|44|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
About three o'clock, in the afternoon of the Sunday in question, a young girl arrived at the inn, accompanied by a young man of dark complexion.|4|44|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The two remained here for some time.|5|44|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
On their departure, they took the road to some thick woods in the vicinity.|6|44|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Madame Deluc's attention was called to the dress worn by the girl, on account of its resemblance to one worn by a deceased relative.|7|44|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
A scarf was particularly noticed.|8|44|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Soon after the departure of the couple, a gang of miscreants made their appearance, behaved boisterously, ate and drank without making payment, followed in the route of the young man and girl, returned to the inn about dusk, and re-crossed the river as if in great haste.|9|44|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It was soon after dark, upon this same evening, that Madame Deluc, as well as her eldest son, heard the screams of a female in the vicinity of the inn.|0|45|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The screams were violent but brief.|1|45|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Madame D. recognized not only the scarf which was found in the thicket, but the dress which was discovered upon the corpse.|2|45|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
An omnibus-driver, Valence,* now also testified that he saw Marie Roget cross a ferry on the Seine, on the Sunday in question, in company with a young man of dark complexion.|3|45|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
He, Valence, knew Marie, and could not be mistaken in her identity.|4|45|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

The items of evidence and information thus collected by myself, from the newspapers, at the suggestion of Dupin, embraced only one more point–but this was a point of seemingly vast consequence.|0|47|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It appears that, immediately after the discovery of the clothes as above described, the lifeless or nearly lifeless body of St. Eustache, Marie's betrothed, was found in the vicinity of what all now supposed the scene of the outrage.|1|47|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"A phial labelled ""laudanum,"" and emptied, was found near him."|2|47|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

He died without speaking.|4|47|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

"""I need scarcely tell you,"" said Dupin, as he finished the perusal of my notes, ""that this is a far more intricate case than that of the Rue Morgue; from which it differs in one important respect."|0|48|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
This is an ordinary, although an atrocious, instance of crime.|1|48|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
There is nothing peculiarly outre about it.|2|48|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
You will observe that, for this reason, the mystery has been considered easy, when, for this reason, it should have been considered difficult, of solution.|3|48|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Thus, at first, it was thought unnecessary to offer a reward.|4|48|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

I have before observed that it is by prominences above the plane of the ordinary, that reason feels her way, if at all, in her search for the true, and that the proper question in cases such as this, is not so much 'what has occurred?|8|48|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
' as 'what has occurred that has never occurred before?|9|48|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
' In the investigations at the house of Madame L'Espanaye,* the agents of G–were discouraged and confounded by that very unusualness which, to a properly regulated intellect, would have afforded the surest omen of success; while this same intellect might have been plunged in despair at the ordinary character of all that met the eye in the case of the perfumery girl, and yet told of nothing but easy triumph to the functionaries of the Prefecture.|10|48|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

Here, too, we are freed, at the commencement, from all supposition of self-murder.|2|50|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The body found at the Barriere du Roule was found under such circumstances as to leave us no room for embarrassment upon this important point.|3|50|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But it has been suggested that the corpse discovered is not that of the Marie Roget for the conviction of whose assassin, or assassins, the reward is offered, and respecting whom, solely, our agreement has been arranged with the Prefect.|4|50|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
We both know this gentleman well.|5|50|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It will not do to trust him too far.|6|50|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
If, dating our inquiries from the body found, and then tracing a murderer, we yet discover this body to be that of some other individual than Marie; or if, starting from the living Marie, we find her, yet find her unassassinated–in either case we lose our labor; since it is Monsieur G–with whom we have to deal.|7|50|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

"""With the public the arguments of L'Etoile have had weight; and that the journal itself is convinced of their importance would appear from the manner in which it commences one of its essays upon the subject–'Several of the morning papers of the day,' it says, 'speak of the conclusive article in Monday's Etoile."|0|51|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

Let us examine the heads of this journal's argument, endeavoring to avoid the incoherence with which it is originally set forth.|1|52|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""The first aim of the writer is to show, from the brevity of the interval between Marie's disappearance and the finding of the floating corpse, that this corpse cannot be that of Marie."|0|53|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The reduction of this interval to its smallest possible dimension, becomes thus, at once, an object with the reasoner.|1|53|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
In the rash pursuit of this object, he rushes into mere assumption at the outset.|2|53|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
'It is folly to suppose,' he says, 'that the murder, if murder was committed on her body, could have been consummated soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight.|3|53|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
' We demand at once, and very naturally, why?|4|53|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Why is it folly to suppose that the murder was committed within five minutes after the girl's quitting her mother's house?|5|53|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Why is it folly to suppose that the murder was committed at any given period of the day?|6|53|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
There have been assassinations at all hours.|7|53|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But, had the murder taken place at any moment between nine o'clock in the morning of Sunday and a quarter before midnight, there would still have been time enough 'to throw the body into the river before midnight.|8|53|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
' This assumption, then, amounts precisely to this–that the murder was not committed on Sunday at all- and, if we allow L'Etoile to assume this, we may permit it any liberties whatever.|9|53|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The paragraph beginning 'It is folly to suppose that the murder, etc.|10|53|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
,' however it appears as printed in L'Etoile, may be imagined to have existed actually thus in the brain of its inditer: 'It is folly to suppose that the murder, if murder was committed on the body, could have been committed soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight; it is folly, we say, to suppose all this, and to suppose at the same time, (as we are resolved to suppose), that the body was not thrown in until after midnight'–a sentence sufficiently inconsequential in itself, but not so utterly preposterous as the one printed.|11|53|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""Were it my purpose,"" continued Dupin, ""merely to make out a case against this passage of L'Etoile's argument, I might safely leave it where it is."|0|54|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It is not, however, with L'Etoile that we have to do, but with truth.|1|54|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The sentence in question has but one meaning, as it stands; and this meaning I have fairly stated, but it is material that we go behind the mere words, for an idea which these words have obviously intended, and failed to convey.|2|54|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It was the design of the journalists to say that at whatever period of the day or night of Sunday this murder was committed, it was improbable that the assassins would have ventured to bear the corpse to the river before midnight.|3|54|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
And herein lies, really, the assumption of which I complain.|4|54|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It is assumed that the murder was committed at such a position, and under such circumstances, that the bearing it to the river became necessary.|5|54|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Now, the assassination might have taken place upon the river's brink, or on the river itself; and, thus, the throwing the corpse in the water might have been resorted to at any period of the day or night, as the most obvious and most immediate mode of disposal.|6|54|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

* This latter print endeavors to combat that portion of the paragraph which has reference to 'drowned bodies' only, by citing some five or six instances in which the bodies of individuals known to be drowned were found floating after the lapse of less time than is insisted upon by L'Etoile.|1|57|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But there is something excessively unphilosophical in the attempt, on the part of Le Moniteur, to rebut the general assertion of L'Etoile, by a citation of particular instances militating against that assertion.|2|57|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Had it been possible to adduce fifty instead of five examples of bodies found floating at the end of two or three days, these fifty examples could still have been properly regarded only as exceptions to L'Etoile's rule, until such time as the rule itself should be confuted.|3|57|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Admitting the rule, (and this Le Moniteur does not deny, insisting merely upon its exceptions,) the argument of L'Etoile is suffered to remain in full force; for this argument does not pretend to involve more than a question of the probability of the body having risen to the surface in less than three days; and this probability will be in favor of L'Etoile's position until the instances so childishly adduced shall be sufficient in number to establish an antagonistical rule.|4|57|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

"""You will see at once that all argument upon this head should be urged, if at all, against the rule itself; and for this end we must examine the rationale of the rule."|0|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Now the human body, in general is neither much lighter nor much heavier than the water of the Seine; that is to say, the specific gravity of the human body, in its natural condition, is about equal to the bulk of fresh water which it displaces.|1|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The bodies of fat and fleshy persons, with small bones, and of women generally, are lighter than those of the lean and large-boned, and of men; and the specific gravity of the water of a river is somewhat influenced by the presence of the tide from the sea.|2|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But, leaving this tide out of the question, it may be said that very few human bodies will sink at all, even in fresh water, of their own accord.|3|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Almost any one, falling into a river, will be enabled to float, if he suffer the specific gravity of the water fairly to be adduced in comparison with his own–that is to say, if he suffer his whole person to be immersed, with as little exception as possible.|4|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The proper position for one who cannot swim, is the upright position of the walker on land, with the head thrown fully back, and immersed; the mouth and nostrils alone remaining above the surface.|5|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Thus circumstanced; we shall find that we float without difficulty and without exertion.|6|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It is evident, however, that the gravities of the body, and of the bulk of water displaced, are very nicely balanced, and that a trifle will cause either to preponderate.|7|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
An arm, for instance, uplifted from the water, and thus deprived of its support, is an additional weight sufficient to immerse the whole head, while the accidental aid of the smallest piece of timber will enable us to elevate the head so as to look about.|8|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Now, in the struggles of one unused to swimming, the arms are invariably thrown upward, while an attempt is made to keep the head in its usual perpendicular position.|9|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The result is the immersion of the mouth and nostrils, and the inception, during efforts to breathe while beneath the surface, of water into the lungs.|10|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Much is also received into the stomach, and the whole body becomes heavier by the difference between the weight of the air originally distending these cavities, and that of the fluid which now fills them.|11|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
This difference is sufficient to cause the body to sink, as a general rule; but is insufficient in the case of individuals with small bones and an abnormal quantity of flaccid or fatty matter.|12|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Such individuals float even after drowning.|13|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""The corpse, being supposed at the bottom of the river, will there remain until, by some means, its specific gravity again becomes less than that of the bulk of water which it displaces."|0|60|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
This effect is brought about by decomposition, or otherwise.|1|60|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The result of decomposition is the generation of gas, distending the cellular tissues and all the cavities, and giving the puffed appearance which is so horrible.|2|60|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
When this distension has so far progressed that the bulk of the corpse is materially increased without a corresponding increase of mass or weight, its specific gravity becomes less than that of the water displaced, and it forthwith makes its appearance at the surface.|3|60|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But decomposition is modified by innumerable circumstances–is hastened or retarded by innumerable agencies; for example, by the heat or cold of the season, by the mineral impregnation or purity of the water, by its depth or shallowness, by its currency or stagnation, by the temperament of the body, by its infection or freedom from disease before death.|4|60|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Thus it is evident that we can assign no period, with anything like accuracy, at which the corpse shall rise through decomposition.|5|60|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Under certain conditions this result would be brought about within an hour, under others it might not take place at all.|6|60|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
There are chemical infusions by which the animal frame can be preserved forever from corruption; the Bi-chloride of Mercury is one.|7|60|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But, apart from decomposition, there may be, and very usually is, a generation of gas within the stomach, from the acetous fermentation of vegetable matter (or within other cavities from other causes), sufficient to induce a distension which will bring the body to the surface.|8|60|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The effect produced by the firing of a cannon is that of simple vibration.|9|60|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
This may either loosen the corpse from the soft mud or ooze in which it is imbedded, thus permitting it to rise when other agencies have already prepared it for so doing, or it may overcome the tenacity of some putrescent portions of the cellular tissue, allowing the cavities to distend under the influence of the gas.|10|60|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""Having thus before us the whole philosophy of this subject, we can easily test by it the assertions of L'Etoile."|0|61|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
'All experience shows,' says this paper, 'that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence, require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water.|1|61|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Even when a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises before at least five or six days' immersion, it sinks again if let alone.|2|61|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""The whole of this paragraph must now appear a tissue of inconsequence and incoherence."|0|62|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
All experience does not show that 'drowned bodies' require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the surface.|1|62|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Both science and experience show that the period of their rising is, and necessarily must be, indeterminate.|2|62|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
If, moreover, a body has risen to the surface through firing of cannon, it will not 'sink again if let alone,' until decomposition has so far progressed as to permit the escape of the generated gas.|3|62|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But I wish to call your attention to the distinction which is made between 'drowned bodies,' and 'bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence: Although the writer admits the distinction, he yet includes them all in the same category.|4|62|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
I have shown how it is that the body of a drowning man becomes specifically heavier than its bulk of water, and that he would not sink at all, except for the struggle by which he elevates his arms above the surface, and his gasps for breath while beneath the surface–gasps which supply by water the place of the original air in the lungs.|5|62|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But these struggles and these gasps would not occur in the body 'thrown into the water immediately after death by violence.|6|62|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
' Thus, in the latter instance, the body, as a general rule, would not sink at all–a fact of which L'Etoile is evidently ignorant.|7|62|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
When decomposition had proceeded to a very great extent- when the flesh had in a great measure left the bones–then, indeed, but not till then, should we lose sight of the corpse.|8|62|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""And now what are we to make of the argument, that the body found could not be that of Marie Roget, because, three days only having elapsed, this body was found floating?"|0|63|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
If drowned, being a woman, she might never have sunk; or, having sunk, might have reappeared in twenty–four hours or less.|1|63|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But no one supposes her to have been drowned; and, dying before being thrown into the river, she might have been found floating at any period afterwards whatever.|2|63|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""'But,' says L'Etoile, 'if the body had been kept in its mangled state on shore until Tuesday night, some trace would be found on shore of the murderers."|0|64|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
' Here it is at first difficult to perceive the intention of the reasoner.|1|64|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
He means to anticipate what he imagines would be an objection to his theory–viz.|2|64|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
: that the body was kept on shore two days, suffering rapid decomposition–more rapid than if immersed in water.|3|64|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
He supposes that, had this been the case, it might have appeared at the surface on the Wednesday, and thinks that only under such circumstances it could so have appeared.|4|64|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
He is accordingly in haste to show that it was not kept on shore; for, if so, 'some trace would be found on shore of the murderers.|5|64|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
' I presume you smile at the sequitur.|6|64|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
You cannot be made to see how the mere duration of the corpse on the shore could operate to multiply traces of the assassins.|7|64|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""'And furthermore it is exceedingly improbable,' continues our journal, 'that any villains who had committed such a murder as is here supposed, would have thrown the body in without weight to sink it, when such a precaution could have so easily been taken."|0|65|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
' Observe, here, the laughable confusion of thought!|1|65|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
No one–not even L'Etoile- disputes the murder committed on the body found.|2|65|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The marks of violence are too obvious.|3|65|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It is our reasoner's object merely to show that this body is not Marie's.|4|65|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
He wishes to prove that Marie is not assassinated–not that the corpse was not.|5|65|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Yet his observation proves only the latter point.|6|65|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Here is a corpse without weight attached.|7|65|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Murderers, casting it in, would not have failed to attach a weight.|8|65|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Therefore it was not thrown in by murderers.|9|65|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
This is all which is proved, if any thing is.|10|65|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The question of identity is not even approached, and L'Etoile has been at great pains merely to gainsay now what it has admitted only a moment before.|11|65|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
'We are perfectly convinced,' it says, 'that the body found was that of a murdered female.|12|65|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""Nor is this the sole instance, even in this division of the subject, where our reasoner unwittingly reasons against himself."|0|66|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
His evident object I have already said, is to reduce, as much as possible, the interval between Marie's disappearance and the finding of the corpse.|1|66|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Yet we find him urging the point that no person saw the girl from the moment of her leaving her mother's house.|2|66|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
'We have no evidence,' he says, 'that Marie Roget was in the land of the living after nine o'clock on Sunday, June the twenty-second.|3|66|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
' As his argument is obviously an ex-parte one, he should, at least, have left this matter out of sight; for had any one been known to see Marie, say on Monday, or on Tuesday, the interval in question would have been much reduced, and, by his own ratiocination, the probability much diminished of the corpse being that of the grisette.|4|66|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It is, nevertheless, amusing to observe that L'Etoile insists upon its point in the full belief of its furthering its general argument.|5|66|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""Reperuse now that portion of this argument which has reference to the identification of the corpse by Beauvais."|0|67|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
In regard to the hair upon the arm, L'Etoile has been obviously disingenuous.|1|67|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
M. Beauvais, not being an idiot, could never have urged in identification of the corpse, simply hair upon its arm.|2|67|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
No arm is without hair.|3|67|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The generality of the expression of L'Etoile is a mere perversion of the witness' phraseology.|4|67|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
He must have spoken of some peculiarity in this hair.|5|67|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It must have been a peculiarity of color, of quantity, of length, or of situation.|6|67|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""'Her foot,' says the journal, 'was small–so are thousands of feet."|0|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Her garter is no proof whatever–nor is her shoe–for shoes and garters are sold in packages.|1|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The same may be said of the flowers in her hat.|2|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
One thing upon which M. Beauvais strongly insists is, that the clasp on the garter found had been set back to take it in.|3|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
This amounts to nothing; for most women find it proper to take a pair of garters home and, fit them to the size of the limbs they are to encircle, rather than to try them in the store where they purchase.|4|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
' Here it is difficult to suppose the reasoner in earnest.|5|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Had M. Beauvais, in his search for the body of Marie, discovered a corpse corresponding in general size and appearance to the missing girl, he would have been warranted (without reference to the question of habiliment at all) in forming an opinion that his search had been successful.|6|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
If, in addition to the point of general size and contour, he had found upon the arm a peculiar hairy appearance which he had observed upon the living Marie, his opinion might have been justly strengthened; and the increase of positiveness might well have been in the ratio of the peculiarity, or unusualness, of the hairy mark.|7|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
If, the feet of Marie being small, those of the corpse were also small, the increase of probability that the body was that of Marie would not be an increase in a ratio merely arithmetical, but in one highly geometrical, or accumulative.|8|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Add to all this shoes such as she had been known to wear upon the day of her disappearance, and, although these shoes may be 'sold in packages,' you so far augment the probability as to verge upon the certain.|9|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
What, of itself, would be no evidence of identity, becomes through its corroborative position, proof most sure.|10|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Give us, then, flowers in the hat corresponding to those worn by the missing girl, and we seek for nothing farther.|11|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
If only one flower, we seek for nothing farther–what then if two or three, or more?|12|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Each successive one is multiple evidence–proof not added to proof, but multiplied by hundreds or thousands.|13|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Let us now discover, upon the deceased, garters such as the living used, and it is almost folly to proceed.|14|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But these garters are found to be tightened, by the setting back of a clasp, in just such a manner as her own had been tightened by Marie shortly previous to her leaving home.|15|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It is now madness or hypocrisy to doubt.|16|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
What L'Etoile says in respect to this abbreviation of the garter's being an unusual occurrence, shows nothing beyond its own pertinacity in error.|17|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The elastic nature of the clasp-garter is self-demonstration of the unusualness of the abbreviation.|18|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
What is made to adjust itself, must of necessity require foreign adjustment but rarely.|19|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It must have been by an accident, in its strictest sense, that these garters of Marie needed the tightening described.|20|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
They alone would have amply established her identity.|21|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But it is not that the corpse was found to have the garters of the missing girl, or found to have her shoes, or her bonnet, or the flowers of her bonnet, or her feet, or a peculiar mark upon the arm, or her general size and appearance–it is that the corpse had each and all collectively.|22|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Could it be proved that the editor of L'Etoile really entertained a doubt, under the circumstances, there would be no need, in his case, of a commission de lunatico inquirendo.|23|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
He has thought it sagacious to echo the small talk of the lawyers, who, for the most part, content themselves with echoing the rectangular precepts of the courts.|24|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
I would here observe that very much of what is rejected as evidence by a court, is the best of evidence to the intellect.|25|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
For the court, guiding itself by the general principles of evidence–the recognized and booked principles–is averse from swerving at particular instances.|26|68|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

In viewing this question in its full and proper light, we must hold steadily in mind the great disproportion between the personal acquaintances of even the most noted individual in Paris, and the entire population of Paris itself.|14|73|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

No observing person can have failed to notice the peculiarly deserted air of the town, from about eight until ten on the morning of every Sabbath.|6|74|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

'A piece,' it says, 'of one of the unfortunate girl's petticoats, two feet long, and one foot wide, was torn out and tied under her chin, and around the back of her head, probably to prevent screams.|1|75|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
This was done by fellows who had no pocket-handkerchiefs.|2|75|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
' Whether this idea is or is not well founded, we will endeavor to see hereafter, but by 'fellows who have no pocket-handkerchiefs,' the editor intends the lowest class of ruffians.|3|75|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
These, however, are the very description of people who will always be found to have handkerchiefs even when destitute of shirts.|4|75|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

You cannot fail to have remarked the extreme laxity of the examination of the corpse.|1|78|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
To be sure, the question of identity was readily determined, or should have been; but there were other points to be ascertained.|2|78|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Had the body been in any respect despoiled?|3|78|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Had the deceased any articles of jewelry about her person upon leaving home?|4|78|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
If so, had she any when found?|5|78|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
These are important questions utterly untouched by the evidence; and there are others of equal moment, which have met with no attention.|6|78|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

Not the least usual error in investigations such as this is the limiting of inquiry to the immediate, with total disregard of the collateral or circumstantial events.|1|79|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It is the malpractice of the courts to confine evidence and discussion to the bounds of apparent relevancy.|2|79|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

But perhaps you do not comprehend me.|5|79|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The history of human knowledge has so uninterruptedly shown that to collateral, or incidental, or accidental events we are indebted for the most numerous and most valuable discoveries, that it has at length become necessary, in any prospective view of improvement, to make not only large, but the largest, allowances for inventions that shall arise by chance, and quite out of the range of ordinary expectation.|6|79|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

In pursuance of Dupin's suggestion, I made scrupulous examination of the affair of the affidavits.|0|81|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

At the end of a week, however, she re-appeared at her customary comptoir, as well as ever, with the exception of a slight paleness not altogether usual.|1|82|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

A gentleman, with his wife and daughter, engaged, about dusk, the services of six young men, who were idly rowing a boat to and fro near the banks of the Seine, to convey him across the river.|1|86|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Upon reaching the opposite shore the three passengers stepped out, and had proceeded so far as to be beyond the view of the boat, when the daughter discovered that she had left in it her parasol.|2|86|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
She returned for it, was seized by the gang, carried out into the stream, gagged, brutally treated, and finally taken to the shore at a point not far from that at which she had originally entered the boat with her parents.|3|86|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

Upon reading these various extracts, they not only seemed to me irrelevant, but I could perceive no mode in which any one of them could be brought to bear upon the matter in hand.|0|95|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
I waited for some explanation from Dupin.|1|95|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""It is not my present design,"" he said, ""to dwell upon the first and second of these extracts."|0|96|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
I have copied them chiefly to show you the extreme remissness of the police, who, as far as I can understand from the Prefect, have not troubled themselves, in any respect, with an examination of the naval officer alluded to.|1|96|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Yet it is mere folly to say that between the first and second disappearance of Marie there is no supposable connection.|2|96|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Let us admit the first elopement to have resulted in a quarrel between the lovers, and the return home of the betrayed.|3|96|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
We are now prepared to view a second elopement (if we know that an elopement has again taken place) as indicating a renewal of the betrayer's advances, rather than as the result of new proposals by a second individual–we are prepared to regard it as a 'making up' of the old amour, rather than as the commencement of a new one.|4|96|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The chances are ten to one, that he who had once eloped with Marie would again propose an elopement, rather than that she to whom proposals of an elopement had been made by one individual, should have them made to her by another.|5|96|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
And here let me call your attention to the fact, that the time elapsing between the first ascertained and the second supposed elopement is a few months more than the general period of the cruises of our men-of-war.|6|96|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Had the lover been interrupted in his first villainy by the necessity of departure to sea, and had he seized the first moment of his return to renew the base designs not yet altogether accomplished–or not yet altogether accomplished by him?|7|96|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Of all these things we know nothing.|8|96|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""You will say, however, that, in the second instance, there was no elopement as imagined."|0|97|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Certainly not–but are we prepared to say that there was not the frustrated design?|1|97|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Beyond St. Eustache, and perhaps Beauvais, we find no recognized, no open, no honorable suitors of Marie.|2|97|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Of none other is there any thing said.|3|97|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Who, then, is the secret lover, of whom the relatives (at least most of them) know nothing, but whom Marie meets upon the morning of Sunday, and who is so deeply in her confidence, that she hesitates not to remain with him until the shades of the evening descend, amid the solitary groves of the Barriere du Roule?|4|97|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Who is that secret lover, I ask, of whom, at least, most of the relatives know nothing?|5|97|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
And what means the singular prophecy of Madam Roget on the morning of Marie's departure?|6|97|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
–'I fear that I shall never see Marie again.|7|97|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""But if we cannot imagine Madame Roget privy to the design of elopement, may we not at least suppose this design entertained by the girl?"|0|98|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Upon quitting home, she gave it to be understood that she was about to visit her aunt in the Rue des Dromes, and St. Eustache was requested to call for her at dark.|1|98|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Now, at first glance, this fact strongly militates against my suggestion;–but let us reflect.|2|98|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
That she did meet some companion, and proceed with him across the river, reaching the Barriere du Roule at so late an hour as three o'clock in the afternoon, is known.|3|98|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But in consenting so to accompany this individual, (for whatever purpose–to her mother known or unknown,) she must have thought of her expressed intention when leaving home, and of the surprise and suspicion aroused in the bosom of her affianced suitor, St. Eustache, when, calling for her, at the hour appointed, in the Rue des Dromes, he should find that she had not been there, and when, moreover, upon returning to the pension with this alarming intelligence, he should become aware of her continued absence from home.|4|98|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
She must have thought of these things, I say.|5|98|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
She must have foreseen the chagrin of St. Eustache, the suspicion of all.|6|98|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
She could not have thought of returning to brave this suspicion; but the suspicion becomes a point of trivial importance to her, if we suppose her not intending to return.|7|98|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""We may imagine her thinking thus–'I am to meet a certain person for the purpose of elopement, or for certain other purposes known only to myself."|0|99|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It is necessary that there be no chance of interruption- there must be sufficient time given us to elude pursuit–I will give it to be understood that I shall visit and spend the day with my aunt at the Rue des Dromes–I will tell St. Eustache not to call for me until dark–in this way, my absence from home for the longest possible period, without causing suspicion or anxiety, will be accounted for, and I shall gain more time than in any other manner.|1|99|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
If I bid St. Eustache call for me at dark, he will be sure not to call before; but if I wholly neglect to bid him call, my time for escape will be diminished, since it will be expected that I return the earlier, and my absence will the sooner excite anxiety.|2|99|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Now, if it were my design to return at all–if I had in contemplation merely a stroll with the individual in question–it would not be my policy to bid St. Eustache call; for, calling, he will be sure to ascertain that I have played him false–a fact of which I might keep him forever in ignorance, by leaving home without notifying him of my intention, by returning before dark, and by then stating that I had been to visit my aunt in the Rue des Dromes.|3|99|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But, as it is my design never to return- or not for some weeks–or not until certain concealments are effected- the gaining of time is the only point about which I need give myself any concern.|4|99|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""You have observed, in your notes, that the most general opinion in relation to this sad affair is, and was from the first, that the girl had been the victim of a gang of blackguards."|0|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Now, the popular opinion, under certain conditions, is not to be disregarded.|1|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
When arising of itself–when manifesting itself in a strictly spontaneous manner–we should look upon it as analogous with that intuition which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius.|2|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
In ninety-nine cases from the hundred I would abide by its decision.|3|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But it is important that we find no palpable traces of suggestion.|4|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The opinion must be rigorously the public's own, and the distinction is often exceedingly difficult to perceive and to maintain.|5|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
In the present instance, it appears to me that this 'public opinion,' in respect to a gang, has been superinduced by the collateral event which is detailed in the third of my extracts.|6|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
All Paris is excited by the discovered corpse of Marie, a girl young, beautiful, and notorious.|7|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
This corpse is found, bearing marks of violence, and floating in the river.|8|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But it is now made known that, at the very period, or about the very period, in which it is supposed that the girl was assassinated, an outrage similar in nature to that endured by the deceased, although less in extent, was perpetrated by a gang of young ruffians, upon the person of a second young female.|9|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Is it wonderful that the one known atrocity should influence the popular judgment in regard to the other unknown?|10|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
This judgment awaited direction, and the known outrage seemed so opportunely to afford it!|11|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Marie, too, was found in the river; and upon this very river was this known outrage committed.|12|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The connection of the two events had about it so much of the palpable, that the true wonder would have been a failure of the populace to appreciate and to seize it.|13|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But, in fact, the one atrocity, known to be so committed, is, if any thing, evidence that the other, committed at a time nearly coincident, was not so committed.|14|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It would have been a miracle indeed, if, while a gang of ruffians were perpetrating, at a given locality, a most unheard–of wrong, there should have been another similar gang, in a similar locality, in the same city, under the same circumstances, with the same means and appliances, engaged in a wrong of precisely the same aspect, at precisely the same period of time!|15|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Yet in what, if not in this marvellous train of coincidence, does the accidentally suggested opinion of the populace call upon us to believe?|16|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""Before proceeding farther, let us consider the supposed scene of the assassination, in the thicket at the Barriere du Roule."|0|101|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
This thicket, although dense, was in the close vicinity of a public road.|1|101|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Within were three or four large stones, forming a kind of seat with a back and a footstool.|2|101|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
On the upper stone was discovered a white petticoat; on the second, a silk scarf.|3|101|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
A parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief were also here found.|4|101|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The handkerchief bore the name 'Marie Roget'.|5|101|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Fragments of dress were seen on the branches around.|6|101|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The earth was trampled, the bushes were broken, and there was every evidence of a violent struggle.|7|101|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""Notwithstanding the acclamation with which the discovery of this thicket was received by the press, and the unanimity with which it was supposed to indicate the precise scene of the outrage, it must be admitted that there was some very good reason for doubt."|0|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
That it was the scene, I may or I may not believe–but there was excellent reason for doubt.|1|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Had the true scene been, as Le Commerciel suggested, in the neighborhood of the Rue Pavee St. Andree, the perpetrators of the crime, supposing them still resident in Paris, would naturally have been stricken with terror at the public attention thus acutely directed into the proper channel; and, in certain classes of minds, there would have arisen, at once, a sense of the necessity of some exertion to re-divert this attention.|2|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
And thus, the thicket of the Barriere du Roule having been already suspected, the idea of placing the articles where they were found, might have been naturally entertained.|3|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
There is no real evidence, although Le Soleil so supposes, that the articles discovered had been more than a very few days in the thicket; while there is much circumstantial proof that they could not have remained there, without attracting attention, during the twenty days elapsing between the fatal Sunday and the afternoon upon which they were found by the boys.|4|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
'They were all mildewed down hard,' says Le Soleil, adopting the opinions of its predecessors, 'with the action of the rain and stuck together from mildew.|5|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The grass had grown around and over some of them.|6|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The silk of the parasol was strong, but the threads of it were run together within.|7|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The upper part, where it had been doubled and folded, was all mildewed and rotten, and tore on being opened.|8|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
' In respect to the grass having 'grown around and over some of them,' it is obvious that the fact could only have been ascertained from the words, and thus from the recollections, of two small boys; for these boys removed the articles and took them home before they had been seen by a third party.|9|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But the grass will grow, especially in warm and damp weather (such as was that of the period of the murder), as much as two or three inches in a single day.|10|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
A parasol lying upon a newly turfed ground, might, in a single week, be entirely concealed from sight by the upspringing grass.|11|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
And touching that mildew upon which the editor of Le Soleil so pertinaciously insists, that he employs the word no less than three times in the brief paragraph just quoted, is he really unaware of the nature of this mildew?|12|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Is he to be told that it is one of the many classes of fungus, of which the most ordinary feature is its upspringing and decadence within twenty-four hours?|13|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""Thus we see, at a glance, that what has been most triumphantly adduced in support of the idea that the articles had been 'for at least three or four weeks' in the thicket, is most absurdly null as regards any evidence of that fact."|0|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
On the other hand, it is exceedingly difficult to believe that these articles could have remained in the thicket specified for a longer period than a single week–for a longer period than from one Sunday to the next.|1|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Those who know any thing of the vicinity of Paris, know the extreme difficulty of finding seclusion, unless at a great distance from its suburbs.|2|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Such a thing as an unexplored or even an unfrequently visited recess, amid its woods or groves, is not for a moment to be imagined.|3|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Let any one who, being at heart a lover of nature, is yet chained by duty to the dust and heat of this great metropolis–let any such one attempt, even during the week-days, to slake his thirst for solitude amid the scenes of natural loveliness which immediately surround us.|4|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
At every second step, he will find the growing charm dispelled by the voice and personal intrusion of some ruffian or party of carousing blackguards.|5|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
He will seek privacy amid the densest foliage, all in vain.|6|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Here are the very nooks where the unwashed most abound–here are the temples most desecrate.|7|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
With sickness of the heart the wanderer will flee back to the polluted Paris as to a less odious because less incongruous sink of pollution.|8|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But if the vicinity of the city is so beset during the working days of the week, how much more so on the Sabbath!|9|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It is now especially that, released from the claims of labor, or deprived of the customary opportunities of crime, the town blackguard seeks the precincts of the town, not through love of the rural, which in his heart he despises, but by way of escape from the restraints and conventionalities of society.|10|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
He desires less the fresh air and the green trees, than the utter license of the country.|11|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Here, at the road-side inn, or beneath the foliage of the woods, he indulges unchecked by any eye except those of his boon companions, in all the mad excess of a counterfeit hilarity- the joint offspring of liberty and of rum.|12|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
I say nothing more than what must be obvious to every dispassionate observer, when I repeat that the circumstance of the articles in question having remained undiscovered, for a longer period than from one Sunday to another, in any thicket in the immediate neighborhood of Paris, is to be looked upon as little less than miraculous.|13|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""But there are not wanting other grounds for the suspicion that the articles were placed in the thicket with the view of diverting attention from the real scene of the outrage."|0|104|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
And first, let me direct your notice to the date of the discovery of the articles.|1|104|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Collate this with the date of the fifth extract made by myself from the newspapers.|2|104|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
You will find that the discovery followed, almost immediately, the urgent communications sent to the evening paper.|3|104|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
These communications, although various, and apparently from various sources, tended all to the same point-viz.|4|104|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
, the directing of attention to a gang as the perpetrators of the outrage, and to the neighborhood of the Barriere du Roule as its scene.|5|104|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Now, here, of course, the suspicion is not that, in consequence of these communications, or of the public attention by them directed, the articles were found by the boys; but the suspicion might and may well have been, that the articles were not before found by the boys, for the reason that the articles had not before been in the thicket; having been deposited there only at so late a period as at the date, or shortly prior to the date of the communications, by the guilty authors of these communications themselves.|6|104|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""This thicket was a singular–an exceedingly singular one."|0|105|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It was unusually dense.|1|105|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Within its naturally walled enclosure were three extraordinary stones, forming a seat with a back and a footstool.|2|105|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
And this thicket, so full of art, was in the immediate vicinity, within a few rods, of the dwelling of Madame Deluc, whose boys were in the habit of closely examining the shrubberies about them in search of the bark of the sassafras.|3|105|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Would it be a rash wager–a wager of one thousand to one–that a day never passed over the heads of these boys without finding at least one of them ensconced in the umbrageous hall, and enthroned upon its natural throne?|4|105|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Those who would hesitate at such a wager, have either never been boys themselves, or have forgotten the boyish nature.|5|105|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
I repeat–it is exceedingly hard to comprehend how the articles could have remained in this thicket undiscovered, for a longer period than one or two days; and that thus there is good ground for suspicion, in spite of the dogmatic ignorance of Le Soleil, that they were, at a comparatively late date, deposited where found.|6|105|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""But there are still other and stronger reasons for believing them so deposited, than any which I have as yet urged."|0|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
And, now, let me beg your notice to the highly artificial arrangement of the articles.|1|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
On the upper stone lay a white petticoat; on the second, a silk scarf; scattered around, were a parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief bearing the name 'Marie Roget.|2|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
' Here is just such an arrangement as would naturally be made by a not over-acute person wishing to dispose the articles naturally.|3|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But it is by no means a really natural arrangement.|4|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
I should rather have looked to see the things all lying on the ground and trampled under foot.|5|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
In the narrow limits of that bower, it would have been scarcely possible that the petticoat and scarf should have retained a position upon the stones, when subjected to the brushing to and fro of many struggling persons.|6|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
'There was evidence,' it is said, 'of a struggle; and the earth was trampled, the bushes were broken,'–but the petticoat and the scarf are found deposited as if upon shelves.|7|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
'The pieces of the frock torn out by the bushes were about three inches wide and six inches long.|8|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
One part was the hem of the frock and it had been mended.|9|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
They looked like strips torn off.|10|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
' Here, inadvertently, Le Soleil has employed an exceedingly suspicious phrase.|11|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
The pieces, as described, do indeed look like strips torn off; but purposely and by hand.|12|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It is one of the rarest of accidents that a piece is 'torn off,' from any garment such as is now in question, by the agency of a thorn.|13|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
From the very nature of such fabrics, a thorn or nail becoming tangled in them, tears them rectangularly–divides them into two longitudinal rents, at right angles with each other, and meeting at an apex where the thorn enters–but it is scarcely possible to conceive the piece 'torn off.|14|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
' I never so knew it, nor did you.|15|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
To tear a piece off from such fabric, two distinct forces, in different directions, will be, in almost every case, required.|16|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
If there be two edges to the fabric- if, for example, it be a pocket-handkerchief, and it is desired to tear from it a slip, then, and then only, will the one force serve the purpose.|17|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But in the present case the question is of a dress, presenting but one edge.|18|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
To tear a piece from the interior, where no edge is presented, could only be effected by a miracle through the agency of thorns, and no one thorn could accomplish it.|19|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But, even where an edge is presented, two thorns will be necessary, operating, the one in two distinct directions, and the other in one.|20|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
And this in the supposition that the edge is unhemmed.|21|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
If hemmed, the matter is nearly out of the question.|22|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
We thus see the numerous and great obstacles in the way of pieces being 'torn off' through the simple agency of 'thorns'; yet we are required to believe not only that one piece but that many have been so torn.|23|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
'And one part,' too, 'was the hem of the frock'!|24|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Another piece was 'part of the skirt, not the hem,'–that is to say, was torn completely out, through the agency of thorns, from the unedged interior of the dress!|25|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
These, I say, are things which one may well be pardoned for disbelieving; yet, taken collectedly, they form, perhaps, less of reasonable ground for suspicion, than the one startling circumstance of the articles having been left in this thicket at all, by any murderers who had enough precaution to think of removing the corpse.|26|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
You will not have apprehended me rightly, however, if you suppose it my design to deny this thicket as the scene of the outrage.|27|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
There might have been a wrong here, or more possibly, an accident at Madame Deluc's.|28|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
But, in fact, this is a point of minor importance.|29|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
We are not engaged in an attempt to discover the scene, but to produce the perpetrators of the murder.|30|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
What I have adduced, notwithstanding the minuteness with which I have adduced it, has been with the view, first, to show the folly of the positive and headlong assertions of Le Soleil, but secondly and chiefly, to bring you, by the most natural route, to a further contemplation of the doubt whether this assassination has, or has not, been the work of a gang.|31|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
"""We will resume this question by mere allusion to the revolting details of the surgeon examined at the inquest."|0|107|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
It is only necessary to say that his published inferences, in regard to the number of the ruffians, have been properly ridiculed as unjust and totally baseless, by all the reputable anatomists of Paris.|1|107|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction
Not that the matter might not have been as inferred, but that there was no ground for the inference:–was there not much for another?|2|107|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|November 1842|Detective fiction

(Quatrain composed for the gates of a market to he erected upon the site of the Jacobin Club House at Paris.|0|1|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I WAS sick --sick unto death with that long agony; and when they at length unbound me, and I was permitted to sit, I felt that my senses were leaving me.|0|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The sentence --the dread sentence of death --was the last of distinct accentuation which reached my ears.|1|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
After that, the sound of the inquisitorial voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum.|2|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
It conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution --perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a mill wheel.|3|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
This only for a brief period; for presently I heard no more.|4|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Yet, for a while, I saw; but with how terrible an exaggeration!|5|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I saw the lips of the black-robed judges.|6|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
They appeared to me white --whiter than the sheet upon which I trace these words --and thin even to grotesqueness; thin with the intensity of their expression of firmness --of immoveable resolution --of stern contempt of human torture.|7|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I saw that the decrees of what to me was Fate, were still issuing from those lips.|8|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I saw them writhe with a deadly locution.|9|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I saw them fashion the syllables of my name; and I shuddered because no sound succeeded.|10|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I saw, too, for a few moments of delirious horror, the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable draperies which enwrapped the walls of the apartment.|11|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
And then my vision fell upon the seven tall candles upon the table.|12|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
At first they wore the aspect of charity, and seemed white and slender angels who would save me; but then, all at once, there came a most deadly nausea over my spirit, and I felt every fibre in my frame thrill as if I had touched the wire of a galvanic battery, while the angel forms became meaningless spectres, with heads of flame, and I saw that from them there would be no help.|13|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
And then there stole into my fancy, like a rich musical note, the thought of what sweet rest there must be in the grave.|14|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The thought came gently and stealthily, and it seemed long before it attained full appreciation; but just as my spirit came at length properly to feel and entertain it, the figures of the judges vanished, as if magically, from before me; the tall candles sank into nothingness; their flames went out utterly; the blackness of darkness supervened; all sensations appeared swallowed up in a mad rushing descent as of the soul into Hades.|15|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Then silence, and stillness, night were the universe.|16|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I had swooned; but still will not say that all of consciousness was lost.|0|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
What of it there remained I will not attempt to define, or even to describe; yet all was not lost.|1|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
In the deepest slumber --no!|2|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
In delirium --no!|3|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
In a swoon --no!|4|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
In death --no!|5|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
even in the grave all is not lost.|6|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Else there is no immortality for man.|7|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Arousing from the most profound of slumbers, we break the gossamer web of some dream.|8|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Yet in a second afterward, (so frail may that web have been) we remember not that we have dreamed.|9|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
In the return to life from the swoon there are two stages; first, that of the sense of mental or spiritual; secondly, that of the sense of physical, existence.|10|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
It seems probable that if, upon reaching the second stage, we could recall the impressions of the first, we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of the gulf beyond.|11|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
And that gulf is --what?|12|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
How at least shall we distinguish its shadows from those of the tomb?|13|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
But if the impressions of what I have termed the first stage, are not, at will, recalled, yet, after long interval, do they not come unbidden, while we marvel whence they come?|14|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
He who has never swooned, is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly familiar faces in coals that glow; is not he who beholds floating in mid-air the sad visions that the many may not view; is not he who ponders over the perfume of some novel flower --is not he whose brain grows bewildered with the meaning of some musical cadence which has never before arrested his attention.|15|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember; amid earnest struggles to regather some token of the state of seeming nothingness into which my soul had lapsed, there have been moments when I have dreamed of success; there have been brief, very brief periods when I have conjured up remembrances which the lucid reason of a later epoch assures me could have had reference only to that condition of seeming unconsciousness.|0|4|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
These shadows of memory tell, indistinctly, of tall figures that lifted and bore me in silence down --down --still down --till a hideous dizziness oppressed me at the mere idea of the interminableness of the descent.|1|4|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
They tell also of a vague horror at my heart, on account of that heart's unnatural stillness.|2|4|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Then comes a sense of sudden motionlessness throughout all things; as if those who bore me (a ghastly train!|3|4|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
) had outrun, in their descent, the limits of the limitless, and paused from the wearisomeness of their toil.|4|4|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
After this I call to mind flatness and dampness; and then all is madness --the madness of a memory which busies itself among forbidden things.|5|4|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound --the tumultuous motion of the heart, and, in my ears, the sound of its beating.|0|5|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Then a pause in which all is blank.|1|5|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Then again sound, and motion, and touch --a tingling sensation pervading my frame.|2|5|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Then the mere consciousness of existence, without thought --a condition which lasted long.|3|5|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Then, very suddenly, thought, and shuddering terror, and earnest endeavor to comprehend my true state.|4|5|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Then a strong desire to lapse into insensibility.|5|5|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Then a rushing revival of soul and a successful effort to move.|6|5|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
And now a full memory of the trial, of the judges, of the sable draperies, of the sentence, of the sickness, of the swoon.|7|5|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Then entire forgetfulness of all that followed; of all that a later day and much earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to recall.|8|5|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
So far, I had not opened my eyes.|0|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I felt that I lay upon my back, unbound.|1|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I reached out my hand, and it fell heavily upon something damp and hard.|2|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
There I suffered it to remain for many minutes, while I strove to imagine where and what I could be.|3|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I longed, yet dared not to employ my vision.|4|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I dreaded the first glance at objects around me.|5|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
It was not that I feared to look upon things horrible, but that I grew aghast lest there should be nothing to see.|6|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
At length, with a wild desperation at heart, I quickly unclosed my eyes.|7|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
My worst thoughts, then, were confirmed.|8|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The blackness of eternal night encompassed me.|9|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I struggled for breath.|10|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The intensity of the darkness seemed to oppress and stifle me.|11|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The atmosphere was intolerably close.|12|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I still lay quietly, and made effort to exercise my reason.|13|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I brought to mind the inquisitorial proceedings, and attempted from that point to deduce my real condition.|14|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The sentence had passed; and it appeared to me that a very long interval of time had since elapsed.|15|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Yet not for a moment did I suppose myself actually dead.|16|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Such a supposition, notwithstanding what we read in fiction, is altogether inconsistent with real existence; --but where and in what state was I?|17|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The condemned to death, I knew, perished usually at the autos-da-fe, and one of these had been held on the very night of the day of my trial.|18|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Had I been remanded to my dungeon, to await the next sacrifice, which would not take place for many months?|19|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
This I at once saw could not be.|20|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Victims had been in immediate demand.|21|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Moreover, my dungeon, as well as all the condemned cells at Toledo, had stone floors, and light was not altogether excluded.|22|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
A fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my heart, and for a brief period, I once more relapsed into insensibility.|0|7|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Upon recovering, I at once started to my feet, trembling convulsively in every fibre.|1|7|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I thrust my arms wildly above and around me in all directions.|2|7|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I felt nothing; yet dreaded to move a step, lest I should be impeded by the walls of a tomb.|3|7|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Perspiration burst from every pore, and stood in cold big beads upon my forehead.|4|7|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The agony of suspense grew at length intolerable, and I cautiously moved forward, with my arms extended, and my eyes straining from their sockets, in the hope of catching some faint ray of light.|5|7|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I proceeded for many paces; but still all was blackness and vacancy.|6|7|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I breathed more freely.|7|7|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
It seemed evident that mine was not, at least, the most hideous of fates.|8|7|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
And now, as I still continued to step cautiously onward, there came thronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of the horrors of Toledo.|0|8|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Of the dungeons there had been strange things narrated --fables I had always deemed them --but yet strange, and too ghastly to repeat, save in a whisper.|1|8|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Was I left to perish of starvation in this subterranean world of darkness; or what fate, perhaps even more fearful, awaited me?|2|8|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
That the result would be death, and a death of more than customary bitterness, I knew too well the character of my judges to doubt.|3|8|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The mode and the hour were all that occupied or distracted me.|4|8|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
My outstretched hands at length encountered some solid obstruction.|0|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
It was a wall, seemingly of stone masonry --very smooth, slimy, and cold.|1|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I followed it up; stepping with all the careful distrust with which certain antique narratives had inspired me.|2|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
This process, however, afforded me no means of ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon; as I might make its circuit, and return to the point whence I set out, without being aware of the fact; so perfectly uniform seemed the wall.|3|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I therefore sought the knife which had been in my pocket, when led into the inquisitorial chamber; but it was gone; my clothes had been exchanged for a wrapper of coarse serge.|4|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I had thought of forcing the blade in some minute crevice of the masonry, so as to identify my point of departure.|5|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The difficulty, nevertheless, was but trivial; although, in the disorder of my fancy, it seemed at first insuperable.|6|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I tore a part of the hem from the robe and placed the fragment at full length, and at right angles to the wall.|7|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
In groping my way around the prison, I could not fail to encounter this rag upon completing the circuit.|8|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
So, at least I thought: but I had not counted upon the extent of the dungeon, or upon my own weakness.|9|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The ground was moist and slippery.|10|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I staggered onward for some time, when I stumbled and fell.|11|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
My excessive fatigue induced me to remain prostrate; and sleep soon overtook me as I lay.|12|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Upon awaking, and stretching forth an arm, I found beside me a loaf and a pitcher with water.|0|10|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I was too much exhausted to reflect upon this circumstance, but ate and drank with avidity.|1|10|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Shortly afterward, I resumed my tour around the prison, and with much toil came at last upon the fragment of the serge.|2|10|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Up to the period when I fell I had counted fifty-two paces, and upon resuming my walk, I had counted forty-eight more; --when I arrived at the rag.|3|10|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
There were in all, then, a hundred paces; and, admitting two paces to the yard, I presumed the dungeon to be fifty yards in circuit.|4|10|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I had met, however, with many angles in the wall, and thus I could form no guess at the shape of the vault; for vault I could not help supposing it to be.|5|10|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I had little object --certainly no hope these researches; but a vague curiosity prompted me to continue them.|0|11|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Quitting the wall, I resolved to cross the area of the enclosure.|1|11|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
At first I proceeded with extreme caution, for the floor, although seemingly of solid material, was treacherous with slime.|2|11|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
At length, however, I took courage, and did not hesitate to step firmly; endeavoring to cross in as direct a line as possible.|3|11|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I had advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner, when the remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my legs.|4|11|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I stepped on it, and fell violently on my face.|5|11|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
In the confusion attending my fall, I did not immediately apprehend a somewhat startling circumstance, which yet, in a few seconds afterward, and while I still lay prostrate, arrested my attention.|0|12|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
It was this --my chin rested upon the floor of the prison, but my lips and the upper portion of my head, although seemingly at a less elevation than the chin, touched nothing.|1|12|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
At the same time my forehead seemed bathed in a clammy vapor, and the peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to my nostrils.|2|12|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I put forward my arm, and shuddered to find that I had fAllan at the very brink of a circular pit, whose extent, of course, I had no means of ascertaining at the moment.|3|12|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Groping about the masonry just below the margin, I succeeded in dislodging a small fragment, and let it fall into the abyss.|4|12|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
For many seconds I hearkened to its reverberations as it dashed against the sides of the chasm in its descent; at length there was a sullen plunge into water, succeeded by loud echoes.|5|12|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
At the same moment there came a sound resembling the quick opening, and as rapid closing of a door overhead, while a faint gleam of light flashed suddenly through the gloom, and as suddenly faded away.|6|12|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me, and congratulated myself upon the timely accident by which I had escaped.|0|13|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Another step before my fall, and the world had seen me no more.|1|13|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
And the death just avoided, was of that very character which I had regarded as fabulous and frivolous in the tales respecting the Inquisition.|2|13|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
To the victims of its tyranny, there was the choice of death with its direst physical agonies, or death with its most hideous moral horrors.|3|13|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I had been reserved for the latter.|4|13|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
By long suffering my nerves had been unstrung, until I trembled at the sound of my own voice, and had become in every respect a fitting subject for the species of torture which awaited me.|5|13|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Shaking in every limb, I groped my way back to the wall; resolving there to perish rather than risk the terrors of the wells, of which my imagination now pictured many in various positions about the dungeon.|0|14|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
In other conditions of mind I might have had courage to end my misery at once by a plunge into one of these abysses; but now I was the veriest of cowards.|1|14|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Neither could I forget what I had read of these pits --that the sudden extinction of life formed no part of their most horrible plan.|2|14|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours; but at length I again slumbered.|0|15|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Upon arousing, I found by my side, as before, a loaf and a pitcher of water.|1|15|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
A burning thirst consumed me, and I emptied the vessel at a draught.|2|15|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
It must have been drugged; for scarcely had I drunk, before I became irresistibly drowsy.|3|15|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
A deep sleep fell upon me --a sleep like that of death.|4|15|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
How long it lasted of course, I know not; but when, once again, I unclosed my eyes, the objects around me were visible.|5|15|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
By a wild sulphurous lustre, the origin of which I could not at first determine, I was enabled to see the extent and aspect of the prison.|6|15|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
In its size I had been greatly mistaken.|0|16|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The whole circuit of its walls did not exceed twenty-five yards.|1|16|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
For some minutes this fact occasioned me a world of vain trouble; vain indeed!|2|16|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
for what could be of less importance, under the terrible circumstances which environed me, then the mere dimensions of my dungeon?|3|16|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
But my soul took a wild interest in trifles, and I busied myself in endeavors to account for the error I had committed in my measurement.|4|16|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The truth at length flashed upon me.|5|16|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
In my first attempt at exploration I had counted fifty-two paces, up to the period when I fell; I must then have been within a pace or two of the fragment of serge; in fact, I had nearly performed the circuit of the vault.|6|16|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I then slept, and upon awaking, I must have returned upon my steps --thus supposing the circuit nearly double what it actually was.|7|16|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
My confusion of mind prevented me from observing that I began my tour with the wall to the left, and ended it with the wall to the right.|8|16|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I had been deceived, too, in respect to the shape of the enclosure.|0|17|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
In feeling my way I had found many angles, and thus deduced an idea of great irregularity; so potent is the effect of total darkness upon one arousing from lethargy or sleep!|1|17|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The angles were simply those of a few slight depressions, or niches, at odd intervals.|2|17|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The general shape of the prison was square.|3|17|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
What I had taken for masonry seemed now to be iron, or some other metal, in huge plates, whose sutures or joints occasioned the depression.|4|17|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The entire surface of this metallic enclosure was rudely daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which the charnel superstition of the monks has given rise.|5|17|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The figures of fiends in aspects of menace, with skeleton forms, and other more really fearful images, overspread and disfigured the walls.|6|17|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I observed that the outlines of these monstrosities were sufficiently distinct, but that the colors seemed faded and blurred, as if from the effects of a damp atmosphere.|7|17|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I now noticed the floor, too, which was of stone.|8|17|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
In the centre yawned the circular pit from whose jaws I had escaped; but it was the only one in the dungeon.|9|17|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
All this I saw indistinctly and by much effort: for my personal condition had been greatly changed during slumber.|0|18|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I now lay upon my back, and at full length, on a species of low framework of wood.|1|18|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
To this I was securely bound by a long strap resembling a surcingle.|2|18|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
It passed in many convolutions about my limbs and body, leaving at liberty only my head, and my left arm to such extent that I could, by dint of much exertion, supply myself with food from an earthen dish which lay by my side on the floor.|3|18|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I saw, to my horror, that the pitcher had been removed.|4|18|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I say to my horror; for I was consumed with intolerable thirst.|5|18|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
This thirst it appeared to be the design of my persecutors to stimulate: for the food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned.|6|18|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Looking upward, I surveyed the ceiling of my prison.|0|19|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
It was some thirty or forty feet overhead, and constructed much as the side walls.|1|19|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
In one of its panels a very singular figure riveted my whole attention.|2|19|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
It was the painted figure of Time as he is commonly represented, save that, in lieu of a scythe, he held what, at a casual glance, I supposed to be the pictured image of a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks.|3|19|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
There was something, however, in the appearance of this machine which caused me to regard it more attentively.|4|19|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
While I gazed directly upward at it (for its position was immediately over my own) I fancied that I saw it in motion.|5|19|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
In an instant afterward the fancy was confirmed.|6|19|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Its sweep was brief, and of course slow.|7|19|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I watched it for some minutes, somewhat in fear, but more in wonder.|8|19|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Wearied at length with observing its dull movement, I turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell.|9|19|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
A slight noise attracted my notice, and, looking to the floor, I saw several enormous rats traversing it.|0|20|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
They had issued from the well, which lay just within view to my right.|1|20|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Even then, while I gazed, they came up in troops, hurriedly, with ravenous eyes, allured by the scent of the meat.|2|20|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
From this it required much effort and attention to scare them away.|3|20|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
It might have been half an hour, perhaps even an hour, (for in cast my I could take but imperfect note of time) before I again cast my eyes upward.|0|21|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
What I then saw confounded and amazed me.|1|21|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The sweep of the pendulum had increased in extent by nearly a yard.|2|21|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
As a natural consequence, its velocity was also much greater.|3|21|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
But what mainly disturbed me was the idea that had perceptibly descended.|4|21|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I now observed --with what horror it is needless to say --that its nether extremity was formed of a crescent of glittering steel, about a foot in length from horn to horn; the horns upward, and the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor.|5|21|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Like a razor also, it seemed massy and heavy, tapering from the edge into a solid and broad structure above.|6|21|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
It was appended to a weighty rod of brass, and the whole hissed as it swung through the air.|7|21|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish ingenuity in torture.|0|22|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
My cognizance of the pit had become known to the inquisitorial agents --the pit whose horrors had been destined for so bold a recusant as myself --the pit, typical of hell, and regarded by rumor as the Ultima Thule of all their punishments.|1|22|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The plunge into this pit I had avoided by the merest of accidents, I knew that surprise, or entrapment into torment, formed an important portion of all the grotesquerie of these dungeon deaths.|2|22|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Having failed to fall, it was no part of the demon plan to hurl me into the abyss; and thus (there being no alternative) a different and a milder destruction awaited me.|3|22|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Milder!|4|22|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I half smiled in my agony as I thought of such application of such a term.|5|22|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
What boots it to tell of the long, long hours of horror more than mortal, during which I counted the rushing vibrations of the steel!|0|23|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Inch by inch --line by line --with a descent only appreciable at intervals that seemed ages --down and still down it came!|1|23|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Days passed --it might have been that many days passed --ere it swept so closely over me as to fan me with its acrid breath.|2|23|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The odor of the sharp steel forced itself into my nostrils.|3|23|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I prayed --I wearied heaven with my prayer for its more speedy descent.|4|23|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I grew frantically mad, and struggled to force myself upward against the sweep of the fearful scimitar.|5|23|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
And then I fell suddenly calm, and lay smiling at the glittering death, as a child at some rare bauble.|6|23|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
There was another interval of utter insensibility; it was brief; for, upon again lapsing into life there had been no perceptible descent in the pendulum.|0|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
But it might have been long; for I knew there were demons who took note of my swoon, and who could have arrested the vibration at pleasure.|1|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Upon my recovery, too, I felt very --oh, inexpressibly sick and weak, as if through long inanition.|2|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Even amid the agonies of that period, the human nature craved food.|3|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
With painful effort I outstretched my left arm as far as my bonds permitted, and took possession of the small remnant which had been spared me by the rats.|4|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
As I put a portion of it within my lips, there rushed to my mind a half formed thought of joy --of hope.|5|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Yet what business had I with hope?|6|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
It was, as I say, a half formed thought --man has many such which are never completed.|7|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I felt that it was of joy --of hope; but felt also that it had perished in its formation.|8|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
In vain I struggled to perfect --to regain it.|9|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Long suffering had nearly annihilated all my ordinary powers of mind.|10|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I was an imbecile --an idiot.|11|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my length.|0|25|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I saw that the crescent was designed to cross the region of the heart.|1|25|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
It would fray the serge of my robe --it would return and repeat its operations --again --and again.|2|25|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Notwithstanding terrifically wide sweep (some thirty feet or more) and the its hissing vigor of its descent, sufficient to sunder these very walls of iron, still the fraying of my robe would be all that, for several minutes, it would accomplish.|3|25|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
And at this thought I paused.|4|25|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I dared not go farther than this reflection.|5|25|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I dwelt upon it with a pertinacity of attention --as if, in so dwelling, I could arrest here the descent of the steel.|6|25|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I forced myself to ponder upon the sound of the crescent as it should pass across the garment --upon the peculiar thrilling sensation which the friction of cloth produces on the nerves.|7|25|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I pondered upon all this frivolity until my teeth were on edge.|8|25|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Down --steadily down it crept.|0|26|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I took a frenzied pleasure in contrasting its downward with its lateral velocity.|1|26|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
To the right --to the left --far and wide --with the shriek of a damned spirit; to my heart with the stealthy pace of the tiger!|2|26|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I alternately laughed and howled as the one or the other idea grew predominant.|3|26|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Down --certainly, relentlessly down!|0|27|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
It vibrated within three inches of my bosom!|1|27|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I struggled violently, furiously, to free my left arm.|2|27|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
This was free only from the elbow to the hand.|3|27|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I could reach the latter, from the platter beside me, to my mouth, with great effort, but no farther.|4|27|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Could I have broken the fastenings above the elbow, I would have seized and attempted to arrest the pendulum.|5|27|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I might as well have attempted to arrest an avalanche!|6|27|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Down --still unceasingly --still inevitably down!|0|28|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I gasped and struggled at each vibration.|1|28|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I shrunk convulsively at its every sweep.|2|28|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
My eyes followed its outward or upward whirls with the eagerness of the most unmeaning despair; they closed themselves spasmodically at the descent, although death would have been a relief, oh!|3|28|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
how unspeakable!|4|28|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Still I quivered in every nerve to think how slight a sinking of the machinery would precipitate that keen, glistening axe upon my bosom.|5|28|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
It was hope that prompted the nerve to quiver --the frame to shrink.|6|28|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
It was hope --the hope that triumphs on the rack --that whispers to the death-condemned even in the dungeons of the Inquisition.|7|28|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in actual contact with my robe, and with this observation there suddenly came over my spirit all the keen, collected calmness of despair.|0|29|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
For the first time during many hours --or perhaps days --I thought.|1|29|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
It now occurred to me that the bandage, or surcingle, which enveloped me, was unique.|2|29|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I was tied by no separate cord.|3|29|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The first stroke of the razorlike crescent athwart any portion of the band, would so detach it that it might be unwound from my person by means of my left hand.|4|29|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
But how fearful, in that case, the proximity of the steel!|5|29|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The result of the slightest struggle how deadly!|6|29|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Was it likely, moreover, that the minions of the torturer had not foreseen and provided for this possibility!|7|29|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Was it probable that the bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the pendulum?|8|29|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Dreading to find my faint, and, as it seemed, in last hope frustrated, I so far elevated my head as to obtain a distinct view of my breast.|9|29|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The surcingle enveloped my limbs and body close in all directions--save in the path of the destroying crescent.|10|29|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Scarcely had I dropped my head back into its original position, when there flashed upon my mind what I cannot better describe than as the unformed half of that idea of deliverance to which I have previously alluded, and of which a moiety only floated indeterminately through my brain when I raised food to my burning lips.|0|30|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The whole thought was now present --feeble, scarcely sane, scarcely definite, --but still entire.|1|30|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I proceeded at once, with the nervous energy of despair, to attempt its execution.|2|30|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
For many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon which I lay, had been literally swarming with rats.|0|31|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
They were wild, bold, ravenous; their red eyes glaring upon me as if they waited but for motionlessness on my part to make me their prey.|1|31|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
"""To what food,"" I thought, ""have they been accustomed in the well""?"|2|31|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
They had devoured, in spite of all my efforts to prevent them, all but a small remnant of the contents of the dish.|0|32|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I had fAllan into an habitual see-saw, or wave of the hand about the platter: and, at length, the unconscious uniformity of the movement deprived it of effect.|1|32|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
In their voracity the vermin frequently fastened their sharp fangs in my fingers.|2|32|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
With the particles of the oily and spicy viand which now remained, I thoroughly rubbed the bandage wherever I could reach it; then, raising my hand from the floor, I lay breathlessly still.|3|32|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
At first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the change --at the cessation of movement.|0|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
They shrank alarmedly back; many sought the well.|1|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
But this was only for a moment.|2|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I had not counted in vain upon their voracity.|3|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Observing that I remained without motion, one or two of the boldest leaped upon the frame-work, and smelt at the surcingle.|4|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
This seemed the signal for a general rush.|5|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Forth from the well they hurried in fresh troops.|6|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
They clung to the wood --they overran it, and leaped in hundreds upon my person.|7|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The measured movement of the pendulum disturbed them not at all.|8|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Avoiding its strokes they busied themselves with the anointed bandage.|9|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
They pressed --they swarmed upon me in ever accumulating heaps.|10|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
They writhed upon my throat; their cold lips sought my own; I was half stifled by their thronging pressure; disgust, for which the world has no name, swelled my bosom, and chilled, with a heavy clamminess, my heart.|11|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Yet one minute, and I felt that the struggle would be over.|12|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Plainly I perceived the loosening of the bandage.|13|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I knew that in more than one place it must be already severed.|14|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
With a more than human resolution I lay still.|15|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Nor had I erred in my calculations --nor had I endured in vain.|0|34|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I at length felt that I was free.|1|34|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The surcingle hung in ribands from my body.|2|34|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
But the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon my bosom.|3|34|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
It had divided the serge of the robe.|4|34|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
It had cut through the linen beneath.|5|34|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Twice again it swung, and a sharp sense of pain shot through every nerve.|6|34|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
But the moment of escape had arrived.|7|34|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
At a wave of my hand my deliverers hurried tumultuously away.|8|34|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
With a steady movement --cautious, sidelong, shrinking, and slow --I slid from the embrace of the bandage and beyond the reach of the scimitar.|9|34|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
For the moment, at least, I was free.|10|34|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror

--and in the grasp of the Inquisition!|1|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I had scarcely stepped from my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison, when the motion of the hellish machine ceased and I beheld it drawn up, by some invisible force, through the ceiling.|2|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
This was a lesson which I took desperately to heart.|3|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
My every motion was undoubtedly watched.|4|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Free!|5|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
--I had but escaped death in one form of agony, to be delivered unto worse than death in some other.|6|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
With that thought I rolled my eves nervously around on the barriers of iron that hemmed me in.|7|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Something unusual --some change which, at first, I could not appreciate distinctly --it was obvious, had taken place in the apartment.|8|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
For many minutes of a dreamy and trembling abstraction, I busied myself in vain, unconnected conjecture.|9|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
During this period, I became aware, for the first time, of the origin of the sulphurous light which illumined the cell.|10|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
It proceeded from a fissure, about half an inch in width, extending entirely around the prison at the base of the walls, which thus appeared, and were, completely separated from the floor.|11|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I endeavored, but of course in vain, to look through the aperture.|12|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
As I arose from the attempt, the mystery of the alteration in the chamber broke at once upon my understanding.|0|36|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I have observed that, although the outlines of the figures upon the walls were sufficiently distinct, yet the colors seemed blurred and indefinite.|1|36|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
These colors had now assumed, and were momentarily assuming, a startling and most intense brilliancy, that gave to the spectral and fiendish portraitures an aspect that might have thrilled even firmer nerves than my own.|2|36|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Demon eyes, of a wild and ghastly vivacity, glared upon me in a thousand directions, where none had been visible before, and gleamed with the lurid lustre of a fire that I could not force my imagination to regard as unreal.|3|36|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Unreal!|0|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
--Even while I breathed there came to my nostrils the breath of the vapour of heated iron!|1|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
A suffocating odour pervaded the prison!|2|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
A deeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that glared at my agonies!|3|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
A richer tint of crimson diffused itself over the pictured horrors of blood.|4|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I panted!|5|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I gasped for breath!|6|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
There could be no doubt of the design of my tormentors --oh!|7|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
most unrelenting!|8|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
oh!|9|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
most demoniac of men!|10|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I shrank from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell.|11|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Amid the thought of the fiery destruction that impended, the idea of the coolness of the well came over my soul like balm.|12|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I rushed to its deadly brink.|13|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I threw my straining vision below.|14|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses.|15|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Yet, for a wild moment, did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what I saw.|16|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
At length it forced --it wrestled its way into my soul --it burned itself in upon my shuddering reason.|17|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
--Oh!|18|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
for a voice to speak!|19|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
--oh!|20|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
horror!|21|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
--oh!|22|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
any horror but this!|23|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
With a shriek, I rushed from the margin, and buried my face in my hands --weeping bitterly.|24|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The heat rapidly increased, and once again I looked up, shuddering as with a fit of the ague.|0|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
There had been a second change in the cell --and now the change was obviously in the form.|1|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
As before, it was in vain that I, at first, endeavoured to appreciate or understand what was taking place.|2|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
But not long was I left in doubt.|3|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The Inquisitorial vengeance had been hurried by my two-fold escape, and there was to be no more dallying with the King of Terrors.|4|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The room had been square.|5|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I saw that two of its iron angles were now acute --two, consequently, obtuse.|6|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The fearful difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning sound.|7|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
In an instant the apartment had shifted its form into that of a lozenge.|8|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
But the alteration stopped not here-I neither hoped nor desired it to stop.|9|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I could have clasped the red walls to my bosom as a garment of eternal peace.|10|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
"""Death,"" I said, ""any death but that of the pit""!"|11|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Fool!|12|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
might I have not known that into the pit it was the object of the burning iron to urge me?|13|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Could I resist its glow?|14|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
or, if even that, could I withstand its pressure And now, flatter and flatter grew the lozenge, with a rapidity that left me no time for contemplation.|15|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
Its centre, and of course, its greatest width, came just over the yawning gulf.|16|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I shrank back --but the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onward.|17|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
At length for my seared and writhing body there was no longer an inch of foothold on the firm floor of the prison.|18|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
I struggled no more, but the agony of my soul found vent in one loud, long, and final scream of despair.|19|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
There was a discordant hum of human voices!|0|39|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
There was a loud blast as of many trumpets!|1|39|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
There was a harsh grating as of a thousand thunders!|2|39|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The fiery walls rushed back!|3|39|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
An outstretched arm caught my own as I fell, fainting, into the abyss.|4|39|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
It was that of General Lasalle.|5|39|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The French army had entered Toledo.|6|39|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
The Inquisition was in the hands of its enemies.|7|39|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842|Horror
It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night.|0|0|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
Object there was none.|1|0|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
Passion there was none.|2|0|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I loved the old man.|3|0|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
He had never wronged me.|4|0|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
He had never given me insult.|5|0|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
For his gold I had no desire.|6|0|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I think it was his eye!|7|0|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
yes, it was this!|8|0|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
He had the eye of a vulture --a pale blue eye, with a film over it.|9|0|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees --very gradually --I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.|10|0|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
Now this is the point.|0|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
You fancy me mad.|1|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
Madmen know nothing.|2|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
But you should have seen me.|3|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work!|4|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him.|5|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it --oh so gently!|6|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head.|7|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in!|8|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man's sleep.|9|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed.|10|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
Ha!|11|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
would a madman have been so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously --cautiously (for the hinges creaked) --I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye.|12|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
And this I did for seven long nights --every night just at midnight --but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye.|13|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night.|14|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.|15|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door.|0|2|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine.|1|2|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers --of my sagacity.|2|2|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph.|3|2|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts.|4|2|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled.|5|2|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
Now you may think that I drew back --but no.|6|2|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.|7|2|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
"I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out --""Who's there""?"|0|3|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I kept quite still and said nothing.|0|4|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down.|1|4|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
He was still sitting up in the bed listening; --just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.|2|4|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror.|0|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
It was not a groan of pain or of grief --oh, no!|1|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
--it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe.|2|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I knew the sound well.|3|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me.|4|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I say I knew it well.|5|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart.|6|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed.|7|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
His fears had been ever since growing upon him.|8|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not.|9|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
"He had been saying to himself --""It is nothing but the wind in the chimney --it is only a mouse crossing the floor,"" or ""It is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp""."|10|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
Yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain.|11|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim.|12|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel --although he neither saw nor heard --to feel the presence of my head within the room.|13|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little --a very, very little crevice in the lantern.|0|6|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
So I opened it --you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily --until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye.|1|6|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
It was open --wide, wide open --and I grew furious as I gazed upon it.|0|7|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I saw it with perfect distinctness --all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old man's face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.|1|7|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over-acuteness of the sense?|0|8|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
--now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton.|1|8|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I knew that sound well, too.|2|8|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
It was the beating of the old man's heart.|3|8|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.|4|8|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
But even yet I refrained and kept still.|0|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I scarcely breathed.|1|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I held the lantern motionless.|2|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eve.|3|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased.|4|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant.|5|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
The old man's terror must have been extreme!|6|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
It grew louder, I say, louder every moment!|7|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
--do you mark me well I have told you that I am nervous: so I am.|8|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror.|9|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still.|10|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
But the beating grew louder, louder!|11|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I thought the heart must burst.|12|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
And now a new anxiety seized me --the sound would be heard by a neighbour!|13|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
The old man's hour had come!|14|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room.|15|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
He shrieked once --once only.|16|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him.|17|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done.|18|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound.|19|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall.|20|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
At length it ceased.|21|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
The old man was dead.|22|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I removed the bed and examined the corpse.|23|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
Yes, he was stone, stone dead.|24|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes.|25|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
There was no pulsation.|26|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
He was stone dead.|27|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
His eve would trouble me no more.|28|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body.|0|10|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence.|1|10|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
First of all I dismembered the corpse.|2|10|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I cut off the head and the arms and the legs.|3|10|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings.|0|11|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye --not even his --could have detected any thing wrong.|1|11|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
There was nothing to wash out --no stain of any kind --no blood-spot whatever.|2|11|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I had been too wary for that.|3|11|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
A tub had caught all --ha!|4|11|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
ha!|5|11|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock --still dark as midnight.|0|12|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door.|1|12|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I went down to open it with a light heart, --for what had I now to fear?|2|12|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the police.|3|12|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
A shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises.|4|12|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I smiled, --for what had I to fear?|0|13|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I bade the gentlemen welcome.|1|13|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream.|2|13|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country.|3|13|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I took my visitors all over the house.|4|13|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I bade them search --search well.|5|13|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I led them, at length, to his chamber.|6|13|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed.|7|13|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.|8|13|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
The officers were satisfied.|0|14|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
My manner had convinced them.|1|14|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I was singularly at ease.|2|14|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things.|3|14|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone.|4|14|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted.|5|14|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
The ringing became more distinct: --It continued and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definiteness --until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears.|6|14|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
No doubt I now grew very pale; --but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice.|0|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
Yet the sound increased --and what could I do?|1|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
It was a low, dull, quick sound --much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton.|2|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I gasped for breath --and yet the officers heard it not.|3|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I talked more quickly --more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased.|4|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased.|5|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
Why would they not be gone?|6|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men --but the noise steadily increased.|7|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
Oh God!|8|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
what could I do?|9|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I foamed --I raved --I swore!|10|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased.|11|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
It grew louder --louder --louder!|12|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled.|13|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
Was it possible they heard not?|14|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
Almighty God!|15|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
--no, no!|16|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
They heard!|17|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror
--they suspected!|18|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|January 1843|Horror

this fellow is dancing mad!|2|0|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
He hath been bitten by the Tarantula.|3|0|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
All in the Wrong.|4|0|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
MANY years ago, I contracted an intimacy with a Mr. William Legrand.|0|1|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
He was of an ancient Huguenot family, and had once been wealthy; but a series of misfortunes had reduced him to want.|1|1|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
To avoid the mortification consequent upon his disasters, he left New Orleans, the city of his forefathers, and took up his residence at Sullivan's Island, near Charleston, South Carolina.|2|1|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
This Island is a very singular one.|0|2|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
It consists of little else than the sea sand, and is about three miles long.|1|2|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Its breadth at no point exceeds a quarter of a mile.|2|2|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
It is separated from the main land by a scarcely perceptible creek, oozing its way through a wilderness of reeds and slime, a favorite resort of the marsh-hen.|3|2|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The vegetation, as might be supposed, is scant, or at least dwarfish.|4|2|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
No trees of any magnitude are to be seen.|5|2|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Near the western extremity, where Fort Moultrie stands, and where are some miserable frame buildings, tenanted, during summer, by the fugitives from Charleston dust and fever, may be found, indeed, the bristly palmetto; but the whole island, with the exception of this western point, and a line of hard, white beach on the seacoast, is covered with a dense undergrowth of the sweet myrtle, so much prized by the horticulturists of England.|6|2|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The shrub here often attains the height of fifteen or twenty feet, and forms an almost impenetrable coppice, burthening the air with its fragrance.|7|2|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
In the inmost recesses of this coppice, not far from the eastern or more remote end of the island, Legrand had built himself a small hut, which he occupied when I first, by mere accident, made his acquaintance.|0|3|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
This soon ripened into friendship --for there was much in the recluse to excite interest and esteem.|1|3|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I found him well educated, with unusual powers of mind, but infected with misanthropy, and subject to perverse moods of alternate enthusiasm and melancholy.|2|3|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
He had with him many books, but rarely employed them.|3|3|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
His chief amusements were gunning and fishing, or sauntering along the beach and through the myrtles, in quest of shells or entomological specimens;-his collection of the latter might have been envied by a Swammerdamm.|4|3|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"In these excursions he was usually accompanied by an old negro, called Jupiter, who had been manumitted before the reverses of the family, but who could be induced, neither by threats nor by promises, to abandon what he considered his right of attendance upon the footsteps of his young ""Massa Will""."|5|3|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
It is not improbable that the relatives of Legrand, conceiving him to be somewhat unsettled in intellect, had contrived to instil this obstinacy into Jupiter, with a view to the supervision and guardianship of the wanderer.|6|3|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The winters in the latitude of Sullivan's Island are seldom very severe, and in the fall of the year it is a rare event indeed when a fire is considered necessary.|0|4|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
About the middle of October, 18--, there occurred, however, a day of remarkable chilliness.|1|4|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Just before sunset I scrambled my way through the evergreens to the hut of my friend, whom I had not visited for several weeks --my residence being, at that time, in Charleston, a distance of nine my miles from the Island, while the facilities of passage and re-passage were very far behind those of the present day.|2|4|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Upon reaching the hut I rapped, as was my custom, and getting no reply, sought for the key where I knew it was secreted, unlocked the door and went in.|3|4|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
A fine fire was blazing upon the hearth.|4|4|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
It was a novelty, and by no means an ungrateful one.|5|4|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I threw off an overcoat, took an arm-chair by the crackling logs, and awaited patiently the arrival of my hosts.|6|4|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Soon after dark they arrived, and gave me a most cordial welcome.|0|5|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Jupiter, grinning from ear to ear, bustled about to prepare some marsh-hens for supper.|1|5|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Legrand was in one of his fits --how else shall I term them?|2|5|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
--of enthusiasm.|3|5|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
He had found an unknown bivalve, forming a new genus, and, more than this, he had hunted down and secured, with Jupiter's assistance, a scarabaeus which he believed to be totally new, but in respect to which he wished to have my opinion on the morrow.|4|5|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""And why not to-night""?"|0|6|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I asked, rubbing my hands over the blaze, and wishing the whole tribe of scarabaei at the devil.|1|6|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Ah, if I had only known you were here""!"|0|7|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"said Legrand, ""but it's so long since I saw you; and how could I foresee that you would pay me a visit this very night of all others?"|1|7|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
As I was coming home I met Lieutenant G--, from the fort, and, very foolishly, I lent him the bug; so it will be impossible for you to see it until morning.|2|7|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Stay here to-night, and I will send Jup down for it at sunrise.|3|7|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"It is the loveliest thing in creation""!"|4|7|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""What?"|0|8|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"--sunrise""?"|1|8|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Nonsense!"|0|9|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
no!|1|9|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
--the bug.|2|9|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
It is of a brilliant gold color --about the size of a large hickory-nut --with two jet black spots near one extremity of the back, and another, somewhat longer, at the other.|3|9|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Dey aint no tin in him, Massa Will, I keep a tellin on you,"" here interrupted Jupiter; ""de bug is a goole bug, solid, ebery bit of him, inside and all, sep him wing --neber feel half so hebby a bug in my life""."|0|10|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Well, suppose it is, Jup,"" replied Legrand, somewhat more earnestly, it seemed to me, than the case demanded, ""is that any reason for your letting the birds burn?"|0|11|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"The color"" --here he turned to me --""is really almost enough to warrant Jupiter's idea."|1|11|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
You never saw a more brilliant metallic lustre than the scales emit --but of this you cannot judge till tomorrow.|2|11|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"In the mean time I can give you some idea of the shape""."|3|11|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Saying this, he seated himself at a small table, on which were a pen and ink, but no paper.|4|11|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
He looked for some in a drawer, but found none.|5|11|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Never mind,"" said he at length, ""this will answer""; and he drew from his waistcoat pocket a scrap of what I took to be very dirty foolscap, and made upon it a rough drawing with the pen."|0|12|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
While he did this, I retained my seat by the fire, for I was still chilly.|1|12|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
When the design was complete, he handed it to me without rising.|2|12|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
As I received it, a loud growl was heard, succeeded by a scratching at the door.|3|12|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Jupiter opened it, and a large Newfoundland, belonging to Legrand, rushed in, leaped upon my shoulders, and loaded me with caresses; for I had shown him much attention during previous visits.|4|12|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
When his gambols were over, I looked at the paper, and, to speak the truth, found myself not a little puzzled at what my friend had depicted.|5|12|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Well""!"|0|13|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"I said, after contemplating it for some minutes, ""this is a strange scarabaeus, I must confess: new to me: never saw anything like it before --unless it was a skull, or a death's-head --which it more nearly resembles than anything else that has come under my observation""."|1|13|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""A death's-head""!"|0|14|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"echoed Legrand --""Oh --yes --well, it has something of that appearance upon paper, no doubt."|1|14|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The two upper black spots look like eyes, eh?|2|14|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"and the longer one at the bottom like a mouth --and then the shape of the whole is oval""."|3|14|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Perhaps so,"" said I; ""but, Legrand, I fear you are no artist."|0|15|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"I must wait until I see the beetle itself, if I am to form any idea of its personal appearance""."|1|15|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Well, I don't know,"" said he, a little nettled, ""I draw tolerably --should do it at least --have had good masters, and flatter myself that I am not quite a blockhead""."|0|16|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""But, my dear fellow, you are joking then,"" said I, ""this is a very passable skull --indeed, I may say that it is a very excellent skull, according to the vulgar notions about such specimens of physiology --and your scarabaeus must be the queerest scarabaeus in the world if it resembles it."|0|17|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Why, we may get up a very thrilling bit of superstition upon this hint.|1|17|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I presume you will call the bug scarabaeus caput hominis, or something of that kind --there are many titles in the Natural Histories.|2|17|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"But where are the antennae you spoke of""?"|3|17|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""The antennae""!"|0|18|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"said Legrand, who seemed to be getting unaccountably warm upon the subject; ""I am sure you must see the antennae."|1|18|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"I made them as distinct as they are in the original insect, and I presume that is sufficient""."|2|18|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Well, well,"" I said, ""perhaps you have --still I don't see them;"" and I handed him the paper without additional remark, not wishing to ruffle his temper; but I was much surprised at the turn affairs had taken; his ill humor puzzled me --and, as for the drawing of the beetle, there were positively no antennae visible, and the whole did bear a very close resemblance to the ordinary cuts of a death's-head."|0|19|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
He received the paper very peevishly, and was about to crumple it, apparently to throw it in the fire, when a casual glance at the design seemed suddenly to rivet his attention.|0|20|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
In an instant his face grew violently red --in another as excessively pale.|1|20|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
For some minutes he continued to scrutinize the drawing minutely where he sat.|2|20|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
At length he arose, took a candle from the table, and proceeded to seat himself upon a sea-chest in the farthest corner of the room.|3|20|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Here again he made an anxious examination of the paper; turning it in all directions.|4|20|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
He said nothing, however, and his conduct greatly astonished me; yet I thought it prudent not to exacerbate the growing moodiness of his temper by any comment.|5|20|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Presently he took from his coat pocket a wallet, placed the paper carefully in it, and deposited both in a writing-desk, which he locked.|6|20|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
He now grew more composed in his demeanor; but his original air of enthusiasm had quite disappeared.|7|20|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Yet he seemed not so much sulky as abstracted.|8|20|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
As the evening wore away he became more and more absorbed in reverie, from which no sallies of mine could arouse him.|9|20|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
It had been my to pass the night at the hut, as I had frequently done before, but, seeing my host in this mood, I deemed it proper to take leave.|10|20|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
He did not press me to remain, but, as I departed, he shook my hand with even more than his usual cordiality.|11|20|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
It was about a month after this (and during the interval I had seen nothing of Legrand) when I received a visit, at Charleston, from his man, Jupiter.|0|21|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I had never seen the good old negro look so dispirited, and I feared that some serious disaster had befAllan my friend.|1|21|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Well, Jup,"" said I, ""what is the matter now?"|0|22|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"--how is your master""?"|1|22|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Why, to speak de troof, massa, him not so berry well as mought be""."|0|23|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Not well!"|0|24|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I am truly sorry to hear it.|1|24|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"What does he complain of""?"|2|24|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure

"""Very sick, Jupiter!"|0|26|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
--why didn't you say so at once?|1|26|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"Is he confined to bed""?"|2|26|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""No, dat he ain't!"|0|27|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure

You say your master is sick.|1|28|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"Hasn't he told you what ails him""?"|2|28|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Why, massa, taint worf while for to git mad bout de matter --Massa Will say noffin at all ain't de matter wid him --but den what make him go about looking dis here way, wid he head down and he soldiers up, and as white as a gose?"|0|29|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure

"""Keeps a syphon wid de figgurs on de slate --de queerest figgurs I ebber did see."|0|31|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure

"""Eh?"|0|32|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
--what?|1|32|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
--ah yes!|2|32|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
--upon the whole I think you had better not be too severe with the poor fellow --don't flog him, Jupiter --he can't very well stand it --but can you form no idea of what has occasioned this illness, or rather this change of conduct?|3|32|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"Has anything unpleasant happened since I saw you""?"|4|32|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""No, massa, dey ain't bin noffin onpleasant since den --'t was fore den I'm feared --'t was de berry day you was dare""."|0|33|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure

I hope you have not been so foolish as to take offence at any little brusquerie of mine; but no, that is improbable.|1|49|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Since I saw you I have had great cause for anxiety.|0|50|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I have something to tell you, yet scarcely know how to tell it, or whether I should tell it at all.|1|50|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I have not been quite well for some days past, and poor old Jup annoys me, almost beyond endurance, by his well-meant attentions.|0|51|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Would you believe it?|1|51|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
--he had prepared a huge stick, the other day, with which to chastise me for giving him the slip, and spending the day, solus, among the hills on the main land.|2|51|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I verily believe that my ill looks alone saved me a flogging.|3|51|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I have made no addition to my cabinet since we met.|0|52|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
If you can, in any way, make it convenient, come over with Jupiter.|0|53|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Do come.|1|53|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I wish to see you tonight, upon business of importance.|2|53|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I assure you that it is of the highest importance.|3|53|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
WILLIAM LEGRAND.|0|55|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
There was something in the tone of this note which gave me great uneasiness.|0|56|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Its whole style differed materially from that of Legrand.|1|56|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
What could he be dreaming of?|2|56|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
What new crotchet possessed his excitable brain?|3|56|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"What ""business of the highest importance"" could he possibly have to transact?"|4|56|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Jupiter's account of him boded no good.|5|56|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I dreaded lest the continued pressure of misfortune had, at length, fairly unsettled the reason of my friend.|6|56|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Without a moment's hesitation, therefore, I prepared to accompany the negro.|7|56|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Upon reaching the wharf, I noticed a scythe and three spades, all apparently new, lying in the bottom of the boat in which we were to embark.|0|57|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""What is the meaning of all this, Jup""?"|0|58|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I inquired.|1|58|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Him syfe, massa, and spade""."|0|59|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Very true; but what are they doing here""?"|0|60|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Him de syfe and de spade what Massa Will sis pon my buying for him in de town, and de debbil's own lot of money I had to gib for em""."|0|61|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"But what, in the name of all that is mysterious, is your 'Massa Will' going to do with scythes and spades""?"|0|62|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Dat's more dan I know, and debbil take me if I don't blieve 'tis more dan he know, too."|0|63|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"But it's all cum ob de bug""."|1|63|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"Finding that no satisfaction was to be obtained of Jupiter, whose whole intellect seemed to be absorbed by ""de bug,"" I now stepped into the boat and made sail."|0|64|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
With a fair and strong breeze we soon ran into the little cove to the northward of Fort Moultrie, and a walk of some two miles brought us to the hut.|1|64|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
It was about three in the afternoon when we arrived.|2|64|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Legrand had been awaiting us in eager expectation.|3|64|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
He grasped my hand with a nervous empressement which alarmed me and strengthened the suspicions already entertained.|4|64|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
His countenance was pale even to ghastliness, and his deep-set eyes glared with unnatural lustre.|5|64|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
After some inquiries respecting his health, I asked him, not knowing what better to say, if he had yet obtained the scarabaeus from Lieutenant G--.|6|64|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Oh, yes,"" he replied, coloring violently, ""I got it from him the next morning."|0|65|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Nothing should tempt me to part with that scarabaeus.|1|65|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"Do you know that Jupiter is quite right about it""?"|2|65|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""In what way""?"|0|66|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I asked, with a sad foreboding at heart.|1|66|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""In supposing it to be a bug of real gold""."|0|67|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
He said this with an air of profound seriousness, and I felt inexpressibly shocked.|1|67|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""This bug is to make my fortune,"" he continued, with a triumphant smile, ""to reinstate me in my family possessions."|0|68|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Is it any wonder, then, that I prize it?|1|68|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Since Fortune has thought fit to bestow it upon me, I have only to use it properly and I shall arrive at the gold of which it is the index.|2|68|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"Jupiter, bring me that scarabaeus""!"|3|68|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""What!"|0|69|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
de bug, massa?|1|69|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"I'd rudder not go fer trubble dat bug --you mus git him for your own self""."|2|69|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Hereupon Legrand arose, with a grave and stately air, and brought me the beetle from a glass case in which it was enclosed.|3|69|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
It was a beautiful scarabaeus, and, at that time, unknown to naturalists --of course a great prize in a scientific point of view.|4|69|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
There were two round, black spots near one extremity of the back, and a long one near the other.|5|69|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The scales were exceedingly hard and glossy, with all the appearance of burnished gold.|6|69|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The weight of the insect was very remarkable, and, taking all things into consideration, I could hardly blame Jupiter for his opinion respecting it; but what to make of Legrand's agreement with that opinion, I could not, for the life of me, tell.|7|69|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""My dear Legrand,"" I cried, interrupting him, ""you are certainly unwell, and had better use some little precautions."|0|71|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
You shall go to bed, and I will remain with you a few days, until you get over this.|1|71|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Feel my pulse,"" said he."|0|72|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I felt it, and, to say the truth, found not the slightest indication of fever.|0|73|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""But you may be ill and yet have no fever."|0|74|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Allow me this once to prescribe for you.|1|74|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
In the first place, go to bed.|2|74|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""You are mistaken,"" he interposed, ""I am as well as I can expect to be under the excitement which I suffer."|0|75|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"If you really wish me well, you will relieve this excitement""."|1|75|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""And how is this to be done""?"|0|76|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Very easily."|0|77|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Jupiter and myself are going upon an expedition into the hills, upon the main land, and, in this expedition, we shall need the aid of some person in whom we can confide.|1|77|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
You are the only one we can trust.|2|77|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"Whether we succeed or fail, the excitement which you now perceive in me will be equally allayed""."|3|77|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""I am anxious to oblige you in any way,"" I replied; ""but do you mean to say that this infernal beetle has any connection with your expedition into the hills""?"|0|78|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""It has""."|0|79|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Then, Legrand, I can become a party to no such absurd proceeding."|0|80|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""I am sorry --very sorry --for we shall have to try it by ourselves""."|0|81|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Try it by yourselves!"|0|82|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The man is surely mad!|1|82|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
--but stay!|2|82|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"--how long do you propose to be absent""?"|3|82|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Probably all night."|0|83|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"We shall start immediately, and be back, at all events, by sunrise""."|1|83|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""And will you promise me, upon your honor, that when this freak of yours is over, and the bug business (good God!"|0|84|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
") settled to your satisfaction, you will then return home and follow my advice implicitly, as that of your physician""?"|1|84|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Yes; I promise; and now let us be off, for we have no time to lose""."|0|85|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
With a heavy heart I accompanied my friend.|0|86|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
We started about four o'clock --Legrand, Jupiter, the dog, and myself.|1|86|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Jupiter had with him the scythe and spades --the whole of which he insisted upon carrying --more through fear, it seemed to me, of trusting either of the implements within reach of his master, than from any excess of industry or complaisance.|2|86|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"His demeanor was dogged in the extreme, and ""dat d--d bug"" were the sole words which escaped his lips during the journey."|3|86|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
For my own part, I had charge of a couple of dark lanterns, while Legrand contented himself with the scarabaeus, which he carried attached to the end of a bit of whip-cord; twirling it to and fro, with the air of a conjuror, as he went.|4|86|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
When I observed this last, plain evidence of my friend's aberration of mind, I could scarcely refrain from tears.|5|86|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I thought it best, however, to humor his fancy, at least for the present, or until I could adopt some more energetic measures with a chance of success.|6|86|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
In the mean time I endeavored, but all in vain, to sound him in regard to the object of the expedition.|7|86|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"Having succeeded in inducing me to accompany him, he seemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any topic of minor importance, and to all my questions vouchsafed no other reply than ""we shall see""!"|8|86|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
We crossed the creek at the head of the island by means of a skiff, and, ascending the high grounds on the shore of the mainland, proceeded in a northwesterly direction, through a tract of country excessively wild and desolate, where no trace of a human footstep was to be seen.|0|87|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Legrand led the way with decision; pausing only for an instant, here and there, to consult what appeared to be certain landmarks of his own contrivance upon a former occasion.|1|87|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
In this manner we journeyed for about two hours, and the sun was just setting when we entered a region infinitely more dreary than any yet seen.|0|88|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
It was a species of table land, near the summit of an almost inaccessible hill, densely wooded from base to pinnacle, and interspersed with huge crags that appeared to lie loosely upon the soil, and in many cases were prevented from precipitating themselves into the valleys below, merely by the support of the trees against which they reclined.|1|88|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Deep ravines, in various directions, gave an air of still sterner solemnity to the scene.|2|88|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The natural platform to which we had clambered was thickly overgrown with brambles, through which we soon discovered that it would have been impossible to force our way but for the scythe; and Jupiter, by direction of his master, proceeded to clear for us a path to the foot of an enormously tall tulip-tree, which stood, with some eight or ten oaks, upon the level, and far surpassed them all, and all other trees which I had then ever seen, in the beauty of its foliage and form, in the wide spread of its branches, and in the general majesty of its appearance.|0|89|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
When we reached this tree, Legrand turned to Jupiter, and asked him if he thought he could climb it.|1|89|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The old man seemed a little staggered by the question, and for some moments made no reply.|2|89|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
At length he approached the huge trunk, walked slowly around it, and examined it with minute attention.|3|89|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Yes, massa, Jup climb any tree he ebber see in he life""."|0|90|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Then up with you as soon as possible, for it will soon be too dark to see what we are about""."|0|91|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""How far mus go up, massa""?"|0|92|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
inquired Jupiter.|1|92|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Get up the main trunk first, and then I will tell you which way to go --and here --stop!"|0|93|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"take this beetle with you""."|1|93|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""De bug, Massa Will!"|0|94|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"--de goole bug""!"|1|94|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"cried the negro, drawing back in dismay --""what for mus tote de bug way up de tree?"|2|94|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"--d--n if I do""!"|3|94|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""If you are afraid, Jup, a great big negro like you, to take hold of a harmless little dead beetle, why you can carry it up by this string --but, if you do not take it up with you in some way, I shall be under the necessity of breaking your head with this shovel""."|0|95|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""What de matter now, massa""?"|0|96|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"said Jup, evidently shamed into compliance; ""always want for to raise fuss wid old nigger."|1|96|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Was only funnin' anyhow.|2|96|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Me feered de bug!|3|96|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"what I keer for de bug""?"|4|96|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Here he took cautiously hold of the extreme end of the string, and, maintaining the insect as far from his person as circumstances would permit, prepared to ascend the tree.|5|96|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
In youth, the tulip-tree, or Liriodendron Tulipiferum, the most magnificent of American foresters, has a trunk peculiarly smooth, and often rises to a great height without lateral branches; but, in its riper age, the bark becomes gnarled and uneven, while many short limbs make their appearance on the stem.|0|97|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Thus the difficulty of ascension, in the present case, lay more in semblance than in reality.|1|97|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Embracing the huge cylinder, as closely as possible, with his arms and knees, seizing with his hands some projections, and resting his naked toes upon others, Jupiter, after one or two narrow escapes from falling, at length wriggled himself into the first great fork, and seemed to consider the whole business as virtually accomplished.|2|97|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The risk of the achievement was, in fact, now over, although the climber was some sixty or seventy feet from the ground.|3|97|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Which way mus go now, Massa Will""?"|0|98|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
he asked.|1|98|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"Keep up the largest branch --the one on this side,"" said Legrand."|0|99|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The negro obeyed him promptly, and apparently with but little trouble; ascending higher and higher, until no glimpse of his squat figure could be obtained through the dense foliage which enveloped it.|1|99|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Presently his voice was heard in a sort of halloo.|2|99|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""How much fudder is got for go""?"|0|100|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""How high up are you""?"|0|101|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
asked Legrand.|1|101|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Ebber so fur,"" replied the negro; ""can see de sky fru de top ob de tree""."|0|102|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Never mind the sky, but attend to what I say."|0|103|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Look down the trunk and count the limbs below you on this side.|1|103|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"How many limbs have you passed""?"|2|103|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""One, two, tree, four, fibe --I done pass fibe big limb, massa, 'pon dis side""."|0|104|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Then go one limb higher""."|0|105|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
In a few minutes the voice was heard again, announcing that the seventh limb was attained.|0|106|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Now, Jup,"" cried Legrand, evidently much excited, ""I want you to work your way out upon that limb as far as you can."|0|107|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"If you see anything strange, let me know""."|1|107|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
By this time what little doubt I might have entertained of my poor friend's insanity, was put finally at rest.|0|108|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I had no alternative but to conclude him stricken with lunacy, and I became seriously anxious about getting him home.|1|108|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
While I was pondering upon what was best to be done, Jupiter's voice was again heard.|2|108|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Mos' feerd for to ventur 'pon dis limb berry far --'tis dead limb putty much all de way""."|0|109|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Did you say it was a dead limb, Jupiter""?"|0|110|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
cried Legrand in a quavering voice.|1|110|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Yes, massa, him dead as de door-nail --done up for sartain --done departed dis here life""."|0|111|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""What in the name of heaven shall I do""?"|0|112|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
asked Legrand, seemingly in the greatest distress.|1|112|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Do""!"|0|113|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"said I, glad of an opportunity to interpose a word, ""why come home and go to bed."|1|113|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Come now!|2|113|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
--that's a fine fellow.|3|113|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"It's getting late, and, besides, you remember your promise""."|4|113|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Jupiter,"" cried he, without heeding me in the least, ""do you hear me""?"|0|114|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Yes, Massa Will, hear you ebber so plain""."|0|115|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Try the wood well, then, with your knife, and see if you think it very rotten""."|0|116|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Him rotten, massa, sure nuff,"" replied the negro in a few moments, ""but not so berry rotten as mought be."|0|117|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"Mought ventur out leetle way pon de limb by myself, dat's true""."|1|117|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure

"""You infernal scoundrel""!"|0|120|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure

"""All dat done, Massa Will; mighty easy ting for to put de bug fru de hole --look out for him dar below""?"|0|140|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
During this colloquy no portion of Jupiter's person could be seen; but the beetle, which he had suffered to descend, was now visible at the end of the string, and glistened, like a globe of burnished gold, in the last rays of the setting sun, some of which still faintly illumined the eminence upon which we stood.|0|141|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The scarabaeus hung quite clear of any branches, and, if allowed to fall, would have fAllan at our feet.|1|141|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Legrand immediately took the scythe, and cleared with it a circular space, three or four yards in diameter, just beneath the insect, and, having accomplished this, ordered Jupiter to let go the string and come down from the tree.|2|141|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Driving a peg, with great nicety, into the ground, at the precise spot where the beetle fell, my friend now produced from his pocket a tape-measure.|0|142|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Fastening one end of this at that point of the trunk of the tree which was nearest the peg, he unrolled it till it reached the peg, and thence farther unrolled it, in the direction already established by the two points of the tree and the peg, for the distance of fifty feet --Jupiter clearing away the brambles with the scythe.|1|142|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
At the spot thus attained a second peg was driven, and about this, as a centre, a rude circle, about four feet in diameter, described.|2|142|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Taking now a spade himself, and giving one to Jupiter and one to me, Legrand begged us to set about one to digging as quickly as possible.|3|142|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
To speak the truth, I had no especial relish for such amusement at any time, and, at that particular moment, would most willingly have declined it; for the night was coming on, and I felt much fatigued with the exercise already taken; but I saw no mode of escape, and was fearful of disturbing my poor friend's equanimity by a refusal.|0|143|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Could I have depended, indeed, upon Jupiter's aid, I would have had no hesitation in attempting to get the lunatic home by force; but I was too well assured of the old negro's disposition, to hope that he would assist me, under any circumstances, in a personal contest with his master.|1|143|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"I made no doubt that the latter had been infected with some of the innumerable Southern superstitions about money buried, and that his phantasy had received confirmation by the finding of the scarabaeus, or, perhaps, by Jupiter's obstinacy in maintaining it to be ""a bug of real gold""."|2|143|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"A mind disposed to lunacy would readily be led away by such suggestions --especially if chiming in with favorite preconceived ideas --and then I called to mind the poor fellow's speech about the beetle's being ""the index of his fortune""."|3|143|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Upon the whole, I was sadly vexed and puzzled, but, at length, I concluded to make a virtue of necessity --to dig with a good will, and thus the sooner to convince the visionary, by ocular demonstration, of the fallacy of the opinions he entertained.|4|143|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The lanterns having been lit, we all fell to work with a zeal worthy a more rational cause; and, as the glare fell upon our persons and implements, I could not help thinking how picturesque a group we composed, and how strange and suspicious our labors must have appeared to any interloper who, by chance, might have stumbled upon our whereabouts.|0|144|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
We dug very steadily for two hours.|0|145|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Little was said; and our chief embarrassment lay in the yelpings of the dog, who took exceeding interest in our proceedings.|1|145|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
He, at length, became so obstreperous that we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some stragglers in the vicinity; --or, rather, this was the apprehension of Legrand; --for myself, I should have rejoiced at any interruption which might have enabled me to get the wanderer home.|2|145|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The noise was, at length, very effectually silenced by Jupiter, who, getting out of the hole with a dogged air of deliberation, tied the brute's mouth up with one of his suspenders, and then returned, with a grave chuckle, to his task.|3|145|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
When the time mentioned had expired, we had reached a depth of five feet, and yet no signs of any treasure became manifest.|0|146|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
A general pause ensued, and I began to hope that the farce was at an end.|1|146|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Legrand, however, although evidently much disconcerted, wiped his brow thoughtfully and recommenced.|2|146|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
We had excavated the entire circle of four feet diameter, and now we slightly enlarged the limit, and went to the farther depth of two feet.|3|146|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Still nothing appeared.|4|146|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The gold-seeker, whom I sincerely pitied, at length clambered from the pit, with the bitterest disappointment imprinted upon every feature, and proceeded, slowly and reluctantly, to put on his coat, which he had thrown off at the beginning of his labor.|5|146|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
In the mean time I made no remark.|6|146|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Jupiter, at a signal from his master, began to gather up his tools.|7|146|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
This done, and the dog having been unmuzzled, we turned in profound silence towards home.|8|146|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
We had taken, perhaps, a dozen steps in this direction, when, with a loud oath, Legrand strode up to Jupiter, and seized him by the collar.|0|147|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the fullest extent, let fall the spades, and fell upon his knees.|1|147|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""You scoundrel,"" said Legrand, hissing out the syllables from between his clenched teeth --""you infernal black villain!"|0|148|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
--speak, I tell you!|1|148|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
--answer me this instant, without prevarication!|2|148|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"which --which is your left eye""?"|3|148|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Oh, my golly, Massa Will!"|0|149|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"ain't dis here my lef' eye for sartain""?"|1|149|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
roared the terrified Jupiter, placing his hand upon his right organ of vision, and holding it there with a desperate pertinacity, as if in immediate dread of his master's attempt at a gouge.|2|149|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""I thought so!"|0|150|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
--I knew it!|1|150|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"--hurrah""!"|2|150|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
vociferated Legrand, letting the negro go, and executing a series of curvets and caracols, much to the astonishment of his valet, who, arising from his knees, looked, mutely, from his master to myself, and then from myself to his master.|3|150|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Come!"|0|151|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"we must go back,"" said the latter, ""the game's not up yet;"" and he again led the way to the tulip-tree."|1|151|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Jupiter,"" said he, when we reached its foot, come here!"|0|152|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"was the skull nailed to the limb with the face outward, or with the face to the limb""?"|1|152|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""De face was out, massa, so dat de crows could get at de eyes good, widout any trouble""."|0|153|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you let the beetle fall""?"|0|154|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
--here Legrand touched each of Jupiter's eyes.|1|154|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""'Twas dis eye, massa --de lef' eye --jis as you tell me,"" and here it was his right eye that the negro indicated."|0|155|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""That will do --we must try it again""."|0|156|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Here my friend, about whose madness I now saw, or fancied that I saw, certain indications of method, removed the peg which marked the spot where the beetle fell, to a spot about three inches to the westward of its former position.|0|157|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Taking, now, the tape-measure from the nearest point of the trunk to the peg, as before, and continuing the extension in a straight line to the distance of fifty feet, a spot was indicated, removed, by several yards, from the point at which we had been digging.|1|157|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Around the new position a circle, somewhat larger than in the former instance, was now described, and we again set to work with the spades.|0|158|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I was dreadfully weary, but, scarcely understanding what had occasioned the change in my thoughts, I felt no longer any great aversion from the labor imposed.|1|158|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I had become most unaccountably interested --nay, even excited.|2|158|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Perhaps there was something, amid all the extravagant demeanor of Legrand --some air of forethought, or of deliberation, which impressed me.|3|158|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I dug eagerly, and now and then caught myself actually looking, with something that very much resembled expectation, for the fancied treasure, the vision of which had demented my unfortunate companion.|4|158|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
At a period when such vagaries of thought most fully possessed me, and when we had been at work perhaps an hour and a half, we were again interrupted by the violent howlings of the dog.|5|158|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
His uneasiness, in the first instance, had been, evidently, but the result of playfulness or caprice, but he now assumed a bitter and serious tone.|6|158|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Upon Jupiter's again attempting to muzzle him, he made furious resistance, and, leaping into the hole, tore up the mould frantically with his claws.|7|158|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
In a few seconds he had uncovered a mass of human bones, forming two complete skeletons, intermingled with several buttons of metal, and what appeared to be the dust of decayed woollen.|8|158|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
One or two strokes of a spade upturned the blade of a large Spanish knife, and, as we dug farther, three or four loose pieces of gold and silver coin came to light.|9|158|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
At sight of these the joy of Jupiter could scarcely be restrained, but the countenance of his master wore an air of extreme disappointment.|0|159|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
He urged us, however, to continue our exertions, and the words were hardly uttered when I stumbled and fell forward, having caught the toe of my boot in a large ring of iron that lay half buried in the loose earth.|1|159|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
We now worked in earnest, and never did I pass ten minutes of more intense excitement.|0|160|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
During this interval we had fairly unearthed an oblong chest of wood, which, from its perfect preservation, and wonderful hardness, had plainly been subjected to some mineralizing process --perhaps that of the Bi-chloride of Mercury.|1|160|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
This box was three feet and a half long, three feet broad, and two and a half feet deep.|2|160|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
It was firmly secured by bands of wrought iron, riveted, and forming a kind of trellis-work over the whole.|3|160|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
On each side of the chest, near the top, were three rings of iron --six in all --by means of which a firm hold could be obtained by six persons.|4|160|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Our utmost united endeavors served only to disturb the coffer very slightly in its bed.|5|160|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
We at once saw the impossibility of removing so great a weight.|6|160|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Luckily, the sole fastenings of the lid consisted of two sliding bolts.|7|160|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
These we drew back --trembling and panting with anxiety.|8|160|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
In an instant, a treasure of incalculable value lay gleaming before us.|9|160|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
As the rays of the lanterns fell within the pit, there flashed upwards, from a confused heap of gold and of jewels, a glow and a glare that absolutely dazzled our eyes.|10|160|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I shall not pretend to describe the feelings with which I gazed.|0|161|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Amazement was, of course, predominant.|1|161|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Legrand appeared exhausted with excitement, and spoke very few words.|2|161|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Jupiter's countenance wore, for some minutes, as deadly a pallor as it is possible, in the nature of things, for any negro's visage to assume.|3|161|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
He seemed stupefied --thunder-stricken.|4|161|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Presently he fell upon his knees in the pit, and, burying his naked arms up to the elbows in gold, let them there remain, as if enjoying the luxury of a bath.|5|161|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
At length, with a deep sigh, he exclaimed, as if in a soliloquy.|6|161|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""And dis all cum ob de goole-bug!"|0|162|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
de putty goole-bug!|1|162|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
de poor little goole-bug, what I boosed in dat sabage kind ob style!|2|162|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Ain't you shamed ob yourself, nigger?|3|162|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"--answer me dat""!"|4|162|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
It became necessary, at last, that I should arouse both master and valet to the expediency of removing the treasure.|0|163|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
It was growing late, and it behooved us to make exertion, that we might get every thing housed before daylight.|1|163|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
It was difficult to say what should be done; and much time was spent in deliberation --so confused were the ideas of all.|2|163|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
We, finally, lightened the box by removing two thirds of its contents, when we were enabled, with some trouble, to raise it from the hole.|3|163|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The articles taken out were deposited among the brambles, and the dog left to guard them, with strict orders from Jupiter neither, upon any pretence, to stir from the spot, nor to open his mouth until our return.|4|163|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
We then hurriedly made for home with the chest; reaching the hut in safety, but after excessive toil, at one o'clock in the morning.|5|163|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Worn out as we were, it was not in human nature to do more just then.|6|163|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
We rested until two, and had supper; starting for the hills immediately afterwards, armed with three stout sacks, which, by good luck, were upon the premises.|7|163|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
A little before four we arrived at the pit, divided the remainder of the booty, as equally as might be, among us, and, leaving the holes unfilled, again set out for the hut, at which, for the second time, we deposited our golden burthens, just as the first streaks of the dawn gleamed from over the tree-tops in the East.|8|163|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
We were now thoroughly broken down; but the intense excitement of the time denied us repose.|0|164|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
After an unquiet slumber of some three or four hours' duration, we arose, as if by preconcert, to make examination of our treasure.|1|164|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The chest had been full to the brim, and we spent the whole day, and the greater part of the next night, in a scrutiny of its contents.|0|165|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
There had been nothing like order or arrangement.|1|165|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Every thing had been heaped in promiscuously.|2|165|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Having assorted all with care, we found ourselves possessed of even vaster wealth than we had at first supposed.|3|165|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
In coin there was rather more than four hundred and fifty thousand dollars --estimating the value of the pieces, as accurately as we could, by the tables of the period.|4|165|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
There was not a particle of silver.|5|165|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
All was gold of antique date and of great variety --French, Spanish, and German money, with a few English guineas, and some counters, of which we had never seen specimens before.|6|165|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
There were several very large and heavy coins, so worn that we could make nothing of their inscriptions.|7|165|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
There was no American money.|8|165|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The value of the jewels we found more difficulty in estimating.|9|165|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
There were diamonds --some of them exceedingly large and fine --a hundred and ten in all, and not one of them small; eighteen rubies of remarkable brilliancy; --three hundred and ten emeralds, all very beautiful; and twenty-one sapphires, with an opal.|10|165|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
These stones had all been broken from their settings and thrown loose in the chest.|11|165|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The settings themselves, which we picked out from among the other gold, appeared to have been beaten up with hammers, as if to prevent identification.|12|165|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Besides all this, there was a vast quantity of solid gold ornaments; --nearly two hundred massive finger and ear rings; --rich chains --thirty of these, if I remember; --eighty-three very large and heavy crucifixes; --five gold censers of great value; --a prodigious golden punch-bowl, ornamented with richly chased vine-leaves and Bacchanalian figures; with two sword-handles exquisitely embossed, and many other smaller articles which I cannot recollect.|13|165|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The weight of these valuables exceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois; and in this estimate I have not included one hundred and ninety-seven superb gold watches; three of the number being worth each five hundred dollars, if one.|14|165|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Many of them were very old, and as time keepers valueless; the works having suffered, more or less, from corrosion --but all were richly jewelled and in cases of great worth.|15|165|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
We estimated the entire contents of the chest, that night, at a million and a half of dollars; and, upon the subsequent disposal of the trinkets and jewels (a few being retained for our own use), it was found that we had greatly undervalued the treasure.|16|165|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
When, at length, we had concluded our examination, and the intense excitement of the time had, in some measure, subsided, Legrand, who saw that I was dying with impatience for a solution of this most extraordinary riddle, entered into a full detail of all the circumstances connected with it.|0|166|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""You remember,"" said he, ""the night when I handed you the rough sketch I had made of the scarabaeus."|0|167|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
You recollect also, that I became quite vexed at you for insisting that my drawing resembled a death's-head.|1|167|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
When you first made this assertion I thought you were jesting; but afterwards I called to mind the peculiar spots on the back of the insect, and admitted to myself that your remark had some little foundation in fact.|2|167|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"Still, the sneer at my graphic powers irritated me --for I am considered a good artist --and, therefore, when you handed me the scrap of parchment, I was about to crumple it up and throw it angrily into the fire""."|3|167|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""No; it had much of the appearance of paper, and at first I supposed it to be such, but when I came to draw upon it, I discovered it, at once, to be a piece of very thin parchment."|0|169|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
It was quite dirty, you remember.|1|169|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Well, as I was in the very act of crumpling it up, my glance fell upon the sketch at which you had been looking, and you may imagine my astonishment when I perceived, in fact, the figure of a death's-head just where, it seemed to me, I had made the drawing of the beetle.|2|169|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
For a moment I was too much amazed to think with accuracy.|3|169|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I knew that my design was very different in detail from this --although there was a certain similarity in general outline.|4|169|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Presently I took a candle, and seating myself at the other end of the room, proceeded to scrutinize the parchment more closely.|5|169|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Upon turning it over, I saw my own sketch upon the reverse, just as I had made it.|6|169|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
My first idea, now, was mere surprise at the really remarkable similarity of outline --at the singular coincidence involved in the fact, that unknown to me, there should have been a skull upon the other side of the parchment, immediately beneath my figure of the scarabaeus and that this skull, not only in outline, but in size, should so closely resemble my drawing.|7|169|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I say the singularity of this coincidence absolutely stupefied me for a time.|8|169|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
This is the usual effect of such coincidences.|9|169|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The mind struggles to establish a connection --a sequence of cause and effect --and, being unable to do so, suffers a species of temporary paralysis.|10|169|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
But, when I recovered from this stupor, there dawned upon me gradually a conviction which startled me even far more than the coincidence.|11|169|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I began distinctly, positively, to remember that there had been no drawing on the parchment when I made my sketch of the scarabaeus.|12|169|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I became perfectly certain of this; for I recollected turning up first one side and then the other, in search of the cleanest spot.|13|169|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Had the skull been then there, of course I could not have failed to notice it.|14|169|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Here was indeed a mystery which I felt it impossible to explain; but, even at that early moment, there it seemed to glimmer, faintly, within the most remote and secret chambers of my intellect, a glow-worm-like conception of that truth which last night's adventure brought to so magnificent a demonstration.|15|169|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I arose at once, and putting the parchment securely away, dismissed all farther reflection until I should be alone.|16|169|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""When you had gone, and when Jupiter was fast asleep, I betook myself to a more methodical investigation of the affair."|0|170|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
In the first place I considered the manner in which the parchment had come into my possession.|1|170|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The spot where we discovered the scarabaeus was on the coast of the main land, about a mile eastward of the island, and but a short distance above high water mark.|2|170|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Upon my taking hold of it, it gave me a sharp bite, which caused me to let it drop.|3|170|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Jupiter, with his accustomed caution, before seizing the insect, which had flown towards him, looked about him for a leaf, or something of that nature, by which to take hold of it.|4|170|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
It was at this moment that his eyes, and mine also, fell upon the scrap of parchment, which I then supposed to be paper.|5|170|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
It was lying half buried in the sand, a corner sticking up.|6|170|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Near the spot where we found it, I observed the remnants of the hull of what appeared to have been a ship's long boat.|7|170|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The wreck seemed to have been there for a very great while; for the resemblance to boat timbers could scarcely be traced.|8|170|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Well, Jupiter picked up the parchment, wrapped the beetle in it, and gave it to me."|0|171|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Soon afterwards we turned to go home, and on the way met Lieutenant G--.|1|171|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I showed him the insect, and he begged me to let him take it to the fort.|2|171|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
On my consenting, he thrust it forthwith into his waistcoat pocket, without the parchment in which it had been wrapped, and which I had continued to hold in my hand during his inspection.|3|171|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Perhaps he dreaded my changing my mind, and thought it best to make sure of the prize at once --you know how enthusiastic he is on all subjects connected with Natural History.|4|171|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
At the same time without being conscious of it, I must have deposited the parchment in my own pocket.|5|171|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""You remember that when I went to the table, for the purpose of making a sketch of the beetle, I found no paper where it was usually kept."|0|172|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I looked in the drawer, and found none there.|1|172|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I searched my pockets, hoping to find an old letter --and then my hand fell upon the parchment.|2|172|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I thus detail the precise mode in which it came into my possession; for the circumstances impressed me with peculiar force.|3|172|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""No doubt you will think me fanciful --but I had already established a kind of connexion."|0|173|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I had put together two links of a great chain.|1|173|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
There was a boat lying on a sea-coast, and not far from the boat was a parchment --not a paper --with a skull depicted on it.|2|173|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
You will, of course, ask 'where is the connexion?|3|173|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
' I reply that the skull, or death's-head, is the well-known emblem of the pirate.|4|173|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The flag of the death's-head is hoisted in all engagements.|5|173|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""I have said that the scrap was parchment, and not paper."|0|174|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Parchment is durable --almost imperishable.|1|174|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Matters of little moment are rarely consigned to parchment; since, for the mere ordinary purposes of drawing or writing, it is not nearly so well adapted as paper.|2|174|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
This reflection suggested some meaning --some relevancy --in the death's-head.|3|174|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I did not fail to observe, also, the form of the parchment.|4|174|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Although one of its corners had been, by some accident, destroyed, it could be seen that the original form was oblong.|5|174|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"It was just such a slip, indeed, as might have been chosen for a memorandum --for a record of something to be long remembered and carefully preserved""."|6|174|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""But,"" I interposed, ""you say that the skull was not upon the parchment when you made the drawing of the beetle."|0|175|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"How then do you trace any connexion between the boat and the skull --since this latter, according to your own admission, must have been designed (God only knows how or by whom) at some period subsequent to your sketching the scarabaeus""?"|1|175|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Ah, hereupon turns the whole mystery; although the secret, at this point, I had comparatively little difficulty in solving."|0|176|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
My steps were sure, and could afford but a single result.|1|176|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I reasoned, for example, thus: When I drew the scarabaeus, there was no skull apparent on the parchment.|2|176|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
When I had completed the drawing, I gave it to you, and observed you narrowly until you returned it.|3|176|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
You, therefore, did not design the skull, and no one else was present to do it.|4|176|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Then it was not done by human agency.|5|176|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
And nevertheless it was done.|6|176|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""At this stage of my reflections I endeavored to remember, and did remember, with entire distinctness, every incident which occurred about the period in question."|0|177|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The weather was chilly (oh rare and happy accident!|1|177|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
), and a fire was blazing on the hearth.|2|177|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I was heated with exercise and sat near the table.|3|177|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
You, however, had drawn a chair close to the chimney.|4|177|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Just as I placed the parchment in your hand, and as you were in the act of inspecting it, Wolf, the Newfoundland, entered, and leaped upon your shoulders.|5|177|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
With your left hand you caressed him and kept him off, while your right, holding the parchment, was permitted to fall listlessly between your knees, and in close proximity to the fire.|6|177|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
At one moment I thought the blaze had caught it, and was about to caution you, but, before I could speak, you had withdrawn it, and were engaged in its examination.|7|177|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
When I considered all these particulars, I doubted not for a moment that heat had been the agent in bringing to light, on the parchment, the skull which I saw designed on it.|8|177|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
You are well aware that chemical preparations exist, and have existed time out of mind, by means of which it is possible to write on either paper or vellum, so that the characters shall become visible only when subjected to the action of fire.|9|177|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Zaire, digested in aqua regia, and diluted with four times its weight of water, is sometimes employed; a green tint results.|10|177|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The regulus of cobalt, dissolved in spirit of nitre, gives a red.|11|177|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
These colors disappear at longer or shorter intervals after the material written on cools, but again become apparent upon the re-application of heat.|12|177|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""I now scrutinized the death's-head with care."|0|178|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Its outer edges --the edges of the drawing nearest the edge of the vellum --were far more distinct than the others.|1|178|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
It was clear that the action of the caloric had been imperfect or unequal.|2|178|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I immediately kindled a fire, and subjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing heat.|3|178|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
At first, the only effect was the strengthening of the faint lines in the skull; but, on persevering in the experiment, there became visible, at the corner of the slip, diagonally opposite to the spot in which the death's-head was delineated, the figure of what I at first supposed to be a goat.|4|178|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"A closer scrutiny, however, satisfied me that it was intended for a kid""."|5|178|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Ha!"|0|179|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"ha""!"|1|179|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"said I, ""to be sure I have no right to laugh at you --a million and a half of money is too serious a matter for mirth --but you are not about to establish a third link in your chain --you will not find any especial connexion between your pirates and goat --pirates, you know, have nothing to do with goats; they appertain to the farming interest""."|2|179|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""But I have just said that the figure was not that of a goat""."|0|180|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Well, a kid then --pretty much the same thing""."|0|181|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Pretty much, but not altogether,"" said Legrand."|0|182|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""You may have heard of one Captain Kidd."|1|182|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I at once looked on the figure of the animal as a kind of punning or hieroglyphical signature.|2|182|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I say signature; because its position on the vellum suggested this idea.|3|182|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The death's-head at the corner diagonally opposite, had, in the same manner, the air of a stamp, or seal.|4|182|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"But I was sorely put out by the absence of all else --of the body to my imagined instrument --of the text for my context""."|5|182|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""I presume you expected to find a letter between the stamp and the signature""."|0|183|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Something of that kind."|0|184|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The fact is, I felt irresistibly impressed with a presentiment of some vast good fortune impending.|1|184|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I can scarcely say why.|2|184|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Perhaps, after all, it was rather a desire than an actual belief; --but do you know that Jupiter's silly words, about the bug being of solid gold, had a remarkable effect on my fancy?|3|184|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
And then the series of accidents and coincidences --these were so very extraordinary.|4|184|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"Do you observe how mere an accident it was that these events should have occurred on the sole day of all the year in which it has been, or may be, sufficiently cool for fire, and that without the fire, or without the intervention of the dog at the precise moment in which he appeared, I should never have become aware of the death's-head, and so never the possessor of the treasure""?"|5|184|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""But proceed --I am all impatience""."|0|185|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Well; you have heard, of course, the many stories current --the thousand vague rumors afloat about money buried, somewhere on the Atlantic coast, by Kidd and his associates."|0|186|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
These rumors must have had some foundation in fact.|1|186|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
And that the rumors have existed so long and so continuously could have resulted, it appeared to me, only from the circumstance of the buried treasure still remaining entombed.|2|186|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Had Kidd concealed his plunder for a time, and afterwards reclaimed it, the rumors would scarcely have reached us in their present unvarying form.|3|186|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
You will observe that the stories told are all about money-seekers, not about money-finders.|4|186|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Had the pirate recovered his money, there the affair would have dropped.|5|186|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
It seemed to me that some accident --say the loss of a memorandum indicating its locality --had deprived him of the means of recovering it, and that this accident had become known to is followers, who otherwise might never have heard that treasure had been concealed at all, and who, busying themselves in vain, because unguided attempts, to regain it, had given first birth, and then universal currency, to the reports which are now so common.|6|186|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"Have you ever heard of any important treasure being unearthed along the coast""?"|7|186|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Never""."|0|187|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""But that Kidd's accumulations were immense, is well known."|0|188|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"I took it for granted, therefore, that the earth still held them; and you will scarcely be surprised when I tell you that I felt a hope, nearly amounting to certainty, that the parchment so strangely found, involved a lost record of the place of deposit""."|1|188|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""But how did you proceed""?"|0|189|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""I held the vellum again to the fire, after increasing the heat; but nothing appeared."|0|190|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I now thought it possible that the coating of dirt might have something to do with the failure; so I carefully rinsed the parchment by pouring warm water over it, and, having done this, I placed it in a tin pan, with the skull downwards, and put the pan upon a furnace of lighted charcoal.|1|190|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
In a few minutes, the pan having become thoroughly heated, I removed the slip, and, to my inexpressible joy, found it spotted, in several places, with what appeared to be figures arranged in lines.|2|190|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Again I placed it in the pan, and suffered it to remain another minute.|3|190|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"On taking it off, the whole was just as you see it now""."|4|190|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure

"""And yet,"" said Legrand, ""the solution is by no means so difficult as you might be led to imagine from the first hasty inspection of the characters."|0|197|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
These characters, as any one might readily guess, form a cipher --that is to say, they convey a meaning; but then, from what is known of Kidd, I could not suppose him capable of constructing any of the more abstruse cryptographs.|1|197|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"I made up my mind, at once, that this was of a simple species --such, however, as would appear, to the crude intellect of the sailor, absolutely insoluble without the key""."|2|197|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""And you really solved it""?"|0|198|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Readily; I have solved others of an abstruseness ten thousand times greater."|0|199|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Circumstances, and a certain bias of mind, have led me to take interest in such riddles, and it may well be doubted whether human ingenuity can construct an enigma of the kind which human ingenuity may not, by proper application, resolve.|1|199|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
In fact, having once established connected and legible characters, I scarcely gave a thought to the mere difficulty of developing their import.|2|199|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""In the present case --indeed in all cases of secret writing --the first question regards the language of the cipher; for the principles of solution, so far, especially, as the more simple ciphers are concerned, depend on, and are varied by, the genius of the particular idiom."|0|200|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
In general, there is no alternative but experiment (directed by probabilities) of every tongue known to him who attempts the solution, until the true one be attained.|1|200|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
But, with the cipher now before us, all difficulty is removed by the signature.|2|200|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The pun on the word 'Kidd' is appreciable in no other language than the English.|3|200|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
But for this consideration I should have begun my attempts with the Spanish and French, as the tongues in which a secret of this kind would most naturally have been written by a pirate of the Spanish main.|4|200|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
As it was, I assumed the cryptograph to be English.|5|200|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""You observe there are no divisions between the words."|0|201|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Had there been divisions, the task would have been comparatively easy.|1|201|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
In such case I should have commenced with a collation and analysis of the shorter words, and, had a word of a single letter occurred, as is most likely, (a or I, for example,) I should have considered the solution as assured.|2|201|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure

E however predominates so remarkably that an individual sentence of any length is rarely seen, in which it is not the prevailing character.|2|216|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Here, then, we have, in the very beginning, the groundwork for something more than a mere guess."|0|217|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The general use which may be made of the table is obvious --but, in this particular cipher, we shall only very partially require its aid.|1|217|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
As our predominant character is 8, we will commence by assuming it as the e of the natural alphabet.|2|217|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
To verify the supposition, let us observe if the 8 be seen often in couples --for e is doubled with great frequency in English --in such words, for example, as 'meet,' 'fleet,' 'speed, 'seen,' 'been,' 'agree,' &amp;c.|3|217|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
In the present instance we see it doubled less than five times, although the cryptograph is brief.|4|217|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Let us assume 8, then, as e."|0|218|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Now, of all words in the language, 'the' is the most usual; let us see, therefore, whether they are not repetitions of any three characters in the same order of collocation, the last of them being 8.|1|218|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
If we discover repetitions of such letters, so arranged, they will most probably represent the word 'the.|2|218|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
' On inspection, we find no less than seven such arrangements, the characters being ;48.|3|218|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
We may, therefore, assume that the semicolon represents t, that 4 represents h, and that 8 represents e --the last being now well confirmed.|4|218|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Thus a great step has been taken.|5|218|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""But, having established a single word, we are enabled to establish a vastly important point; that is to say, several commencements and terminations of other words."|0|219|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Let us refer, for example, to the last instance but one, in which the combination ;48 occurs --not far from the end of the cipher.|1|219|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
We know that the semicolon immediately ensuing is the commencement of a word, and, of the six characters succeeding this 'the,' we are cognizant of no less than five.|2|219|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure

' Gaining no information on the subject, I was on the point of extending my sphere of search, and proceeding in a more systematic manner, when, one morning, it entered into my head, quite suddenly, that this 'Bishop's Hostel' might have some reference to an old family, of the name of Bessop, which, time out of mind, had held possession of an ancient manor-house, about four miles to the northward of the Island.|1|265|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I accordingly went over to the plantation, and reinstituted my inquiries among the older negroes of the place.|2|265|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
At length one of the most aged of the women said that she had heard of such a place as Bessop's Castle, and thought that she could guide me to it, but that it was not a castle, nor a tavern, but a high rock.|3|265|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure

I made no doubt that here was the 'devil's-seat' alluded to in the MS.|2|267|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
, and now I seemed to grasp the full secret of the riddle.|3|267|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""The 'good glass,' I knew, could have reference to nothing but a telescope; for the word 'glass' is rarely employed in any other sense by seamen."|0|268|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Now here, I at once saw, was a telescope to be used, and a definite point of view, admitting no variation, from which to use it.|1|268|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Nor did I hesitate to believe that the phrases, 'twenty-one degrees and thirteen minutes,' and northeast and by north,' were intended as directions for the levelling of the glass.|2|268|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Greatly excited by these discoveries, I hurried home, procured a telescope, and returned to the rock.|3|268|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure

This fact confirmed my preconceived idea.|1|269|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I proceeded to use the glass.|2|269|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Of course, the 'twenty-one degrees and thirteen minutes' could allude to nothing but elevation above the visible horizon, since the horizontal direction was clearly indicated by the words, 'northeast and by north.|3|269|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
' This latter direction I at once established by means of a pocket-compass; then, pointing the glass as nearly at an angle of twenty-one degrees of elevation as I could do it by guess, I moved it cautiously up or down, until my attention was arrested by a circular rift or opening in the foliage of a large tree that overtopped its fellows in the distance.|4|269|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
In the centre of this rift I perceived a white spot, but could not, at first, distinguish what it was.|5|269|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
Adjusting the focus of the telescope, I again looked, and now made it out to be a human skull.|6|269|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""On this discovery I was so sanguine as to consider the enigma solved; for the phrase 'main branch, seventh limb, east side,' could refer only to the position of the skull on the tree, while shoot from the left eye of the death's-head' admitted, also, of but one interpretation, in regard to a search for buried treasure."|0|270|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"I perceived that the design was to drop a bullet from the left eye of the skull, and that a bee-line, or, in other words, a straight line, drawn from the nearest point of the trunk through 'the shot,' (or the spot where the bullet fell,) and thence extended to a distance of fifty feet, would indicate a definite point --and beneath this point I thought it at least possible that a deposit of value lay concealed""."|1|270|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""All this,"" I said, ""is exceedingly clear, and, although ingenious, still simple and explicit."|0|271|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"When you left the Bishop's Hotel, what then""?"|1|271|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Why, having carefully taken the bearings of the tree, I turned homewards."|0|272|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
The instant that I left 'the devil's seat,' however, the circular rift vanished; nor could I get a glimpse of it afterwards, turn as I would.|1|272|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
What seems to me the chief ingenuity in this whole business, is the fact (for repeated experiment has convinced me it is a fact) that the circular opening in question is visible from no other attainable point of view than that afforded by the narrow ledge on the face of the rock.|2|272|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""In this expedition to the 'Bishop's Hotel' I had been attended by Jupiter, who had, no doubt, observed, for some weeks past, the abstraction of my demeanor, and took especial care not to leave me alone."|0|273|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
But, on the next day, getting up very early, I contrived to give him the slip, and went into the hills in search of the tree.|1|273|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
After much toil I found it.|2|273|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
When I came home at night my valet proposed to give me a flogging.|3|273|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"With the rest of the adventure I believe you are as well acquainted as myself""."|4|273|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""I suppose,"" said I, ""you missed the spot, in the first attempt at digging through Jupiter's stupidity in letting the bug fall through the right instead of the left of the skull""."|0|274|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Precisely."|0|275|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
This mistake made a difference of about two inches and a half in the 'shot' --that is to say, in the position of the peg nearest the tree; and had the treasure been beneath the 'shot,' the error would have been of little moment; but the 'shot,' together with the nearest point of the tree, were merely two points for the establishment of a line of direction; of course the error, however trivial in the beginning, increased as we proceeded with the line, and by the time we had gone fifty feet, threw us quite off the scent.|1|275|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"But for my deep-seated convictions that treasure was here somewhere actually buried, we might have had all our labor in vain""."|2|275|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""I presume the fancy of the skull, of letting fall a bullet through the skull's eye --was suggested to Kidd by the piratical flag."|0|276|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"No doubt he felt a kind of poetical consistency in recovering his money through this ominous insignium""."|1|276|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Perhaps so; still I cannot help thinking that common-sense had quite as much to do with the matter as poetical consistency."|0|277|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"To be visible from the devil's-seat, it was necessary that the object, if small, should be white; and there is nothing like your human skull for retaining and even increasing its whiteness under exposure to all vicissitudes of weather""."|1|277|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""But your grandiloquence, and your conduct in swinging the beetle --how excessively odd!"|0|278|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
I was sure you were mad.|1|278|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"And why did you insist on letting fall the bug, instead of a bullet, from the skull""?"|2|278|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Why, to be frank, I felt somewhat annoyed by your evident suspicions touching my sanity, and so resolved to punish you quietly, in my own way, by a little bit of sober mystification."|0|279|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
For this reason I swung the beetle, and for this reason I let it fall from the tree.|1|279|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"An observation of yours about its great weight suggested the latter idea""."|2|279|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""Yes, I perceive; and now there is only one point which puzzles me."|0|280|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"What are we to make of the skeletons found in the hole""?"|1|280|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"""That is a question I am no more able to answer than yourself."|0|281|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
There seems, however, only one plausible way of accounting for them --and yet it is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as my suggestion would imply.|1|281|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
It is clear that Kidd --if Kidd indeed secreted this treasure, which I doubt not --it is clear that he must have had assistance in the labor.|2|281|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
But, the worst of this labor concluded, he may have thought it expedient to remove all participants in his secret.|3|281|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
"Perhaps a couple of blows with a mattock were sufficient, while his coadjutors were busy in the pit; perhaps it required a dozen --who shall tell""?"|4|281|The Gold-Bug|June 1843|Adventure
FOR the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about to pen, I neither expect nor solicit belief.|0|1|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Mad indeed would I be to expect it, in a case where my very senses reject their own evidence.|1|1|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Yet, mad am I not --and very surely do I not dream.|2|1|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
But to-morrow I die, and to-day I would unburthen my soul.|3|1|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
My immediate purpose is to place before the world, plainly, succinctly, and without comment, a series of mere household events.|4|1|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
In their consequences, these events have terrified --have tortured --have destroyed me.|5|1|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Yet I will not attempt to expound them.|6|1|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
To me, they have presented little but Horror --to many they will seem less terrible than baroques.|7|1|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Hereafter, perhaps, some intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the common-place --some intellect more calm, more logical, and far less excitable than my own, which will perceive, in the circumstances I detail with awe, nothing more than an ordinary succession of very natural causes and effects.|8|1|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my disposition.|0|2|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make me the jest of my companions.|1|2|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I was especially fond of animals, and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets.|2|2|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
With these I spent most of my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing them.|3|2|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
This peculiar of character grew with my growth, and in my manhood, I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure.|4|2|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
To those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious dog, I need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the gratification thus derivable.|5|2|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
There is something in the unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man.|6|2|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not uncongenial with my own.|0|3|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Observing my partiality for domestic pets, she lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind.|1|3|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
We had birds, gold fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey, and a cat.|2|3|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely black, and sagacious to an astonishing degree.|0|4|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
In speaking of his intelligence, my wife, who at heart was not a little tinctured with superstition, made frequent allusion to the ancient popular notion, which regarded all black cats as witches in disguise.|1|4|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Not that she was ever serious upon this point --and I mention the matter at all for no better reason than that it happens, just now, to be remembered.|2|4|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Pluto --this was the cat's name --was my favorite pet and playmate.|0|5|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I alone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went about the house.|1|5|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
It was even with difficulty that I could prevent him from following me through the streets.|2|5|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Our friendship lasted, in this manner, for several years, during which my general temperament and character --through the instrumentality of the Fiend Intemperance --had (I blush to confess it) experienced a radical alteration for the worse.|0|6|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I grew, day by day, more moody, more irritable, more regardless of the feelings of others.|1|6|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I suffered myself to use intemperate language to my At length, I even offered her personal violence.|2|6|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
My pets, of course, were made to feel the change in my disposition.|3|6|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I not only neglected, but ill-used them.|4|6|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
For Pluto, however, I still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from maltreating him, as I made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits, the monkey, or even the dog, when by accident, or through affection, they came in my way.|5|6|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
But my disease grew upon me --for what disease is like Alcohol!|6|6|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
--and at length even Pluto, who was now becoming old, and consequently somewhat peevish --even Pluto began to experience the effects of my ill temper.|7|6|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
One night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one of my haunts about town, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence.|0|7|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I seized him; when, in his fright at my violence, he inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with his teeth.|1|7|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
The fury of a demon instantly possessed me.|2|7|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I knew myself no longer.|3|7|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
My original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight from my body; and a more than fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled every fibre of my frame.|4|7|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I took from my waistcoat-pocket a pen-knife, opened it, grasped the poor beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one of its eyes from the socket!|5|7|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I blush, I burn, I shudder, while I pen the damnable atrocity.|6|7|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
When reason returned with the morning --when I had slept off the fumes of the night's debauch --I experienced a sentiment half of horror, half of remorse, for the crime of which I had been guilty; but it was, at best, a feeble and equivocal feeling, and the soul remained untouched.|0|8|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I again plunged into excess, and soon drowned in wine all memory of the deed.|1|8|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
In the meantime the cat slowly recovered.|0|9|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
The socket of the lost eye presented, it is true, a frightful appearance, but he no longer appeared to suffer any pain.|1|9|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
He went about the house as usual, but, as might be expected, fled in extreme terror at my approach.|2|9|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I had so much of my old heart left, as to be at first grieved by this evident dislike on the part of a creature which had once so loved me.|3|9|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
But this feeling soon gave place to irritation.|4|9|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
And then came, as if to my final and irrevocable overthrow, the spirit of PERVERSENESS.|5|9|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Of this spirit philosophy takes no account.|6|9|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Yet I am not more sure that my soul lives, than I am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the human heart --one of the indivisible primary faculties, or sentiments, which give direction to the character of Man.|7|9|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Who has not, a hundred times, found himself committing a vile or a silly action, for no other reason than because he knows he should not?|8|9|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Have we not a perpetual inclination, in the teeth of our best judgment, to violate that which is Law, merely because we understand it to be such?|9|9|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
This spirit of perverseness, I say, came to my final overthrow.|10|9|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
It was this unfathomable longing of the soul to vex itself --to offer violence to its own nature --to do wrong for the wrong's sake only --that urged me to continue and finally to consummate the injury I had inflicted upon the unoffending brute.|11|9|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
One morning, in cool blood, I slipped a noose about its neck and hung it to the limb of a tree; --hung it with the tears streaming from my eyes, and with the bitterest remorse at my heart; --hung it because I knew that it had loved me, and because I felt it had given me no reason of offence; --hung it because I knew that in so doing I was committing a sin --a deadly sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place it --if such a thing were possible --even beyond the reach of the infinite mercy of the Most Merciful and Most Terrible God.|12|9|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
On the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done, I was aroused from sleep by the cry of fire.|0|10|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
The curtains of my bed were in flames.|1|10|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
The whole house was blazing.|2|10|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
It was with great difficulty that my wife, a servant, and myself, made our escape from the conflagration.|3|10|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
The destruction was complete.|4|10|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
My entire worldly wealth was swallowed up, and I resigned myself thenceforward to despair.|5|10|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of cause and effect, between the disaster and the atrocity.|0|11|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
But I am detailing a chain of facts --and wish not to leave even a possible link imperfect.|1|11|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
On the day succeeding the fire, I visited the ruins.|2|11|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
The walls, with one exception, had fAllan in.|3|11|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
This exception was found in a compartment wall, not very thick, which stood about the middle of the house, and against which had rested the head of my bed.|4|11|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
The plastering had here, in great measure, resisted the action of the fire --a fact which I attributed to its having been recently spread.|5|11|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
About this wall a dense crowd were collected, and many persons seemed to be examining a particular portion of it with every minute and eager attention.|6|11|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
"The words ""strange""!"|7|11|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
"""singular""!"|8|11|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
and other similar expressions, excited my curiosity.|9|11|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I approached and saw, as if graven in bas relief upon the white surface, the figure of a gigantic cat.|10|11|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
The impression was given with an accuracy truly marvellous.|11|11|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
There was a rope about the animal's neck.|12|11|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
When I first beheld this apparition --for I could scarcely regard it as less --my wonder and my terror were extreme.|0|12|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
But at length reflection came to my aid.|1|12|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
The cat, I remembered, had been hung in a garden adjacent to the house.|2|12|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Upon the alarm of fire, this garden had been immediately filled by the crowd --by some one of whom the animal must have been cut from the tree and thrown, through an open window, into my chamber.|3|12|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
This had probably been done with the view of arousing me from sleep.|4|12|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
The falling of other walls had compressed the victim of my cruelty into the substance of the freshly-spread plaster; the lime of which, had then with the flames, and the ammonia from the carcass, accomplished the portraiture as I saw it.|5|12|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Although I thus readily accounted to my reason, if not altogether to my conscience, for the startling fact 'just detailed, it did not the less fall to make a deep impression upon my fancy.|0|13|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
For months I could not rid myself of the phantasm of the cat; and, during this period, there came back into my spirit a half-sentiment that seemed, but was not, remorse.|1|13|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I went so far as to regret the loss of the animal, and to look about me, among the vile haunts which I now habitually frequented, for another pet of the same species, and of somewhat similar appearance, with which to supply its place.|2|13|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
One night as I sat, half stupefied, in a den of more than infamy, my attention was suddenly drawn to some black object, reposing upon the head of one of the immense hogsheads of Gin, or of Rum, which constituted the chief furniture of the apartment.|0|14|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I had been looking steadily at the top of this hogshead for some minutes, and what now caused me surprise was the fact that I had not sooner perceived the object thereupon.|1|14|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I approached it, and touched it with my hand.|2|14|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
It was a black cat --a very large one --fully as large as Pluto, and closely resembling him in every respect but one.|3|14|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Pluto had not a white hair upon any portion of his body; but this cat had a large, although indefinite splotch of white, covering nearly the whole region of the breast.|4|14|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Upon my touching him, he immediately arose, purred loudly, rubbed against my hand, and appeared delighted with my notice.|0|15|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
This, then, was the very creature of which I was in search.|1|15|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I at once offered to purchase it of the landlord; but this person made no claim to it --knew nothing of it --had never seen it before.|2|15|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I continued my caresses, and, when I prepared to go home, the animal evinced a disposition to accompany me.|0|16|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I permitted it to do so; occasionally stooping and patting it as I proceeded.|1|16|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
When it reached the house it domesticated itself at once, and became immediately a great favorite with my wife.|2|16|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
For my own part, I soon found a dislike to it arising within me.|0|17|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
This was just the reverse of what I had anticipated; but I know not how or why it was --its evident fondness for myself rather disgusted and annoyed.|1|17|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
By slow degrees, these feelings of disgust and annoyance rose into the bitterness of hatred.|2|17|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I avoided the creature; a certain sense of shame, and the remembrance of my former deed of cruelty, preventing me from physically abusing it.|3|17|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I did not, for some weeks, strike, or otherwise violently ill use it; but gradually --very gradually --I came to look upon it with unutterable loathing, and to flee silently from its odious presence, as from the breath of a pestilence.|4|17|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
What added, no doubt, to my hatred of the beast, was the discovery, on the morning after I brought it home, that, like Pluto, it also had been deprived of one of its eyes.|0|18|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
This circumstance, however, only endeared it to my wife, who, as I have already said, possessed, in a high degree, that humanity of feeling which had once been my distinguishing trait, and the source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures.|1|18|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
With my aversion to this cat, however, its partiality for myself seemed to increase.|0|19|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
It followed my footsteps with a pertinacity which it would be difficult to make the reader comprehend.|1|19|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Whenever I sat, it would crouch beneath my chair, or spring upon my knees, covering me with its loathsome caresses.|2|19|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
If I arose to walk it would get between my feet and thus nearly throw me down, or, fastening its long and sharp claws in my dress, clamber, in this manner, to my breast.|3|19|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
At such times, although I longed to destroy it with a blow, I was yet withheld from so doing, partly it at by a memory of my former crime, but chiefly --let me confess it at once --by absolute dread of the beast.|4|19|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
This dread was not exactly a dread of physical evil-and yet I should be at a loss how otherwise to define it.|0|20|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I am almost ashamed to own --yes, even in this felon's cell, I am almost ashamed to own --that the terror and horror with which the animal inspired me, had been heightened by one of the merest chimaeras it would be possible to conceive.|1|20|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
My wife had called my attention, more than once, to the character of the mark of white hair, of which I have spoken, and which constituted the sole visible difference between the strange beast and the one I had y si destroyed.|2|20|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
The reader will remember that this mark, although large, had been originally very indefinite; but, by slow degrees --degrees nearly imperceptible, and which for a long time my Reason struggled to reject as fanciful --it had, at length, assumed a rigorous distinctness of outline.|3|20|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
It was now the representation of an object that I shudder to name --and for this, above all, I loathed, and dreaded, and would have rid myself of the monster had I dared --it was now, I say, the image of a hideous --of a ghastly thing --of the GALLOWS!|4|20|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
--oh, mournful and terrible engine of Horror and of Crime --of Agony and of Death!|5|20|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
And now was I indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere Humanity.|0|21|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
And a brute beast --whose fellow I had contemptuously destroyed --a brute beast to work out for me --for me a man, fashioned in the image of the High God --so much of insufferable wo!|1|21|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Alas!|2|21|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
neither by day nor by night knew I the blessing of Rest any more!|3|21|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
During the former the creature left me no moment alone; and, in the latter, I started, hourly, from dreams of unutterable fear, to find the hot breath of the thing upon my face, and its vast weight --an incarnate Night-Mare that I had no power to shake off --incumbent eternally upon my heart!|4|21|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Beneath the pressure of torments such as these, the feeble remnant of the good within me succumbed.|0|22|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Evil thoughts became my sole intimates --the darkest and most evil of thoughts.|1|22|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
The moodiness of my usual temper increased to hatred of all things and of all mankind; while, from the sudden, frequent, and ungovernable outbursts of a fury to which I now blindly abandoned myself, my uncomplaining wife, alas!|2|22|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
was the most usual and the most patient of sufferers.|3|22|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
One day she accompanied me, upon some household errand, into the cellar of the old building which our poverty compelled us to inhabit.|0|23|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
The cat followed me down the steep stairs, and, nearly throwing me headlong, exasperated me to madness.|1|23|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Uplifting an axe, and forgetting, in my wrath, the childish dread which had hitherto stayed my hand, I aimed a blow at the animal which, of course, would have proved instantly fatal had it descended as I wished.|2|23|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
But this blow was arrested by the hand of my wife.|3|23|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Goaded, by the interference, into a rage more than demoniacal, I withdrew my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain.|4|23|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
She fell dead upon the spot, without a groan.|5|23|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
This hideous murder accomplished, I set myself forthwith, and with entire deliberation, to the task of concealing the body.|0|24|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I knew that I could not remove it from the house, either by day or by night, without the risk of being observed by the neighbors.|1|24|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Many projects entered my mind.|2|24|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
At one period I thought of cutting the corpse into minute fragments, and destroying them by fire.|3|24|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
At another, I resolved to dig a grave for it in the floor of the cellar.|4|24|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Again, I deliberated about casting it in the well in the yard --about packing it in a box, as if merchandize, with the usual arrangements, and so getting a porter to take it from the house.|5|24|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Finally I hit upon what I considered a far better expedient than either of these.|6|24|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I determined to wall it up in the cellar --as the monks of the middle ages are recorded to have walled up their victims.|7|24|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
For a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted.|0|25|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Its walls were loosely constructed, and had lately been plastered throughout with a rough plaster, which the dampness of the atmosphere had prevented from hardening.|1|25|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Moreover, in one of the walls was a projection, caused by a false chimney, or fireplace, that had been filled up, and made to resemble the rest of the cellar.|2|25|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I made no doubt that I could readily displace the at this point, insert the corpse, and wall the whole up as before, so that no eye could detect anything suspicious.|3|25|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
And in this calculation I was not deceived.|0|26|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
By means of a crow-bar I easily dislodged the bricks, and, having carefully deposited the body against the inner wall, I propped it in that position, while, with little trouble, I re-laid the whole structure as it originally stood.|1|26|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Having procured mortar, sand, and hair, with every possible precaution, I prepared a plaster could not every poss be distinguished from the old, and with this I very carefully went over the new brick-work.|2|26|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
When I had finished, I felt satisfied that all was right.|3|26|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
The wall did not present the slightest appearance of having been disturbed.|4|26|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
The rubbish on the floor was picked up with the minutest care.|5|26|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
"I looked around triumphantly, and said to myself --""Here at least, then, my labor has not been in vain""."|6|26|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
My next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause of so much wretchedness; for I had, at length, firmly resolved to put it to death.|0|27|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Had I been able to meet with it, at the moment, there could have been no doubt of its fate; but it appeared that the crafty animal had been alarmed at the violence of my previous anger, and forebore to present itself in my present mood.|1|27|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
It is impossible to describe, or to imagine, the deep, the blissful sense of relief which the absence of the detested creature occasioned in my bosom.|2|27|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
It did not make its appearance during the night --and thus for one night at least, since its introduction into the house, I soundly and tranquilly slept; aye, slept even with the burden of murder upon my soul!|3|27|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
The second and the third day passed, and still my tormentor came not.|0|28|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Once again I breathed as a free-man.|1|28|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
The monster, in terror, had fled the premises forever!|2|28|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I should behold it no more!|3|28|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
My happiness was supreme!|4|28|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
The guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but little.|5|28|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Some few inquiries had been made, but these had been readily answered.|6|28|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Even a search had been instituted --but of course nothing was to be discovered.|7|28|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I looked upon my future felicity as secured.|8|28|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Upon the fourth day of the assassination, a party of the police came, very unexpectedly, into the house, and proceeded again to make rigorous investigation of the premises.|0|29|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Secure, however, in the inscrutability of my place of concealment, I felt no embarrassment whatever.|1|29|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
The officers bade me accompany them in their search.|2|29|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
They left no nook or corner unexplored.|3|29|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
At length, for the third or fourth time, they descended into the cellar.|4|29|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I quivered not in a muscle.|5|29|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
My heart beat calmly as that of one who slumbers in innocence.|6|29|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I walked the cellar from end to end.|7|29|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I folded my arms upon my bosom, and roamed easily to and fro.|8|29|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
The police were thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart.|9|29|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
The glee at my heart was too strong to be restrained.|10|29|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I burned to say if but one word, by way of triumph, and to render doubly sure their assurance of my guiltlessness.|11|29|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
"""Gentlemen,"" I said at last, as the party ascended the steps, ""I delight to have allayed your suspicions."|0|30|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I wish you all health, and a little more courtesy.|1|30|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
"By the bye, gentlemen, this --this is a very well constructed house""."|2|30|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
(In the rabid desire to say something easily, I scarcely knew what I uttered at all.|3|30|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
") --""I may say an excellently well constructed house."|4|30|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
These walls --are you going, gentlemen?|5|30|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
"--these walls are solidly put together""; and here, through the mere phrenzy of bravado, I rapped heavily, with a cane which I held in my hand, upon that very portion of the brick-work behind which stood the corpse of the wife of my bosom."|6|30|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
But may God shield and deliver me from the fangs of the Arch-Fiend!|0|31|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
No sooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into silence than I was answered by a voice from within the tomb!|1|31|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
--by a cry, at first muffled and broken, like the sobbing of a child, and then quickly swelling into one long, loud, and continuous scream, utterly anomalous and inhuman --a howl --a wailing shriek, half of horror and half of triumph, such as might have arisen only out of hell, conjointly from the throats of the damned in their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation.|2|31|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Of my own thoughts it is folly to speak.|0|32|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Swooning, I staggered to the opposite wall.|1|32|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
For one instant the party upon the stairs remained motionless, through extremity of terror and of awe.|2|32|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
In the next, a dozen stout arms were tolling at the wall.|3|32|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
It fell bodily.|4|32|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
The corpse, already greatly decayed and clotted with gore, stood erect before the eyes of the spectators.|5|32|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
Upon its head, with red extended mouth and solitary eye of fire, sat the hideous beast whose craft had seduced me into murder, and whose informing voice had consigned me to the hangman.|6|32|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
I had walled the monster up within the tomb!|7|32|The Black Cat|August 19, 1843|Horror
SINCE the world began there have been two Jeremys.|0|2|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
The one wrote a Jeremiad about usury, and was called Jeremy Bentham.|1|2|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He has been much admired by Mr. John Neal, and was a great man in a small way.|2|2|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
The other gave name to the most important of the Exact Sciences, and was a great man in a great way; I may say, indeed, in the very greatest of ways.|3|2|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Diddling; or the abstract idea conveyed by the verb to diddle; is sufficiently well understood.|0|3|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Yet the fact, the deed, the thing diddling, is somewhat difficult to define.|1|3|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
We may get, however, at a tolerably distinct conception of the matter in hand, by defining- not the thing, diddling, in itself; but man, as an animal that diddles.|2|3|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Had Plato but hit upon this, he would have been spared the affront of the picked chicken.|3|3|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"Very pertinently it was demanded of Plato, why a picked chicken, which was clearly ""a biped without feathers,"" was not, according to his own definition, a man?"|0|4|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
But I am not to be bothered by any similar query.|1|4|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Man is an animal that diddles, and there is no animal that diddles but man.|2|4|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
It will take an entire hen-coop of picked chickens to get over that.|3|4|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
What constitutes the essence, the nare, the principle of diddling is, in fact, peculiar to the class of creatures that wear coats and pantaloons.|0|5|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
A crow thieves; a fox cheats; a weasel outwits; a man diddles.|1|5|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
To diddle is his destiny.|2|5|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""Man was made to mourn,"" says the poet."|3|5|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
But not so:; he was made to diddle.|4|5|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
This is his aim; his object- his end.|5|5|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"And for this reason when a man's diddled we say he's ""done""."|6|5|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Diddling, rightly considered, is a compound, of which the ingredients are minuteness, interest, perseverance, ingenuity, audacity, nonchalance, originality, impertinence, and grin.|0|6|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Minuteness:; Your diddler is minute.|0|7|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
His operations are upon a small scale.|1|7|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
His business is retail, for cash, or approved paper at sight.|2|7|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"Should he ever be tempted into magnificent speculation, he then, at once, loses his distinctive features, and becomes what we term ""financier""."|3|7|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
This latter word conveys the diddling idea in every respect except that of magnitude.|4|7|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"A diddler may thus be regarded as a banker in petto; a ""financial operation,"" as a diddle at Brobdignag."|5|7|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"The one is to the other, as Homer to ""Flaccus""; as a Mastodon to a mouse; as the tail of a comet to that of a pig."|6|7|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Interest:; Your diddler is guided by self-interest.|0|8|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He scorns to diddle for the mere sake of the diddle.|1|8|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He has an object in view- his pocket; and yours.|2|8|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He regards always the main chance.|3|8|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He looks to Number One.|4|8|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
You are Number Two, and must look to yourself.|5|8|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Perseverance:; Your diddler perseveres.|0|9|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He is not readily discouraged.|1|9|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Should even the banks break, he cares nothing about it.|2|9|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Ut canis a corio nunquam absterrebitur uncto.|0|10|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
so he never lets go of his game.|0|11|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Ingenuity:; Your diddler is ingenious.|0|12|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He has constructiveness large.|1|12|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He understands plot.|2|12|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He invents and circumvents.|3|12|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Were he not Alexander he would be Diogenes.|4|12|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Were he not a diddler, he would be a maker of patent rat-traps or an angler for trout.|5|12|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Audacity:; Your diddler is audacious.|0|13|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
; He is a bold man.|1|13|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He carries the war into Africa.|2|13|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He conquers all by assault.|3|13|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He would not fear the daggers of Frey Herren.|4|13|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
With a little more prudence Dick Turpin would have made a good diddler; with a trifle less blarney, Daniel O'Connell; with a pound or two more brains Charles the Twelfth.|5|13|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Nonchalance:; Your diddler is nonchalant.|0|14|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He is not at all nervous.|1|14|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He never had any nerves.|2|14|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He is never seduced into a flurry.|3|14|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He is never put out; unless put out of doors.|4|14|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He is cool; cool as a cucumber.|5|14|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"He is calm; ""calm as a smile from Lady Bury""."|6|14|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He is easy- easy as an old glove, or the damsels of ancient Baiae.|7|14|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Originality:; Your diddler is original; conscientiously so.|0|15|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
His thoughts are his own.|1|15|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He would scorn to employ those of another.|2|15|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
A stale trick is his aversion.|3|15|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He would return a purse, I am sure, upon discovering that he had obtained it by an unoriginal diddle.|4|15|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Impertinence.|0|16|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
; Your diddler is impertinent.|1|16|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He swaggers.|2|16|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He sets his arms a-kimbo.|3|16|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He thrusts.|4|16|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
his hands in his trowsers' pockets.|5|16|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He sneers in your face.|6|16|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He treads on your corns.|7|16|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He eats your dinner, he drinks your wine, he borrows your money, he pulls your nose, he kicks your poodle, and he kisses your wife.|8|16|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Grin:; Your true diddler winds up all with a grin.|0|17|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
But this nobody sees but himself.|1|17|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He grins when his daily work is done; when his allotted labors are accomplished; at night in his own closet, and altogether for his own private entertainment.|2|17|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He goes home.|3|17|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He locks his door.|4|17|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He divests himself of his clothes.|5|17|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He puts out his candle.|6|17|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He gets into bed.|7|17|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He places his head upon the pillow.|8|17|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
All this done, and your diddler grins.|9|17|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
This is no hypothesis.|10|17|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
It is a matter of course.|11|17|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
I reason a priori, and a diddle would be no diddle without a grin.|12|17|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
The origin of the diddle is referrable to the infancy of the Human Race.|0|18|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Perhaps the first diddler was Adam.|1|18|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
At all events, we can trace the science back to a very remote period of antiquity.|2|18|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
The moderns, however, have brought it to a perfection never dreamed of by our thick-headed progenitors.|3|18|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"Without pausing to speak of the ""old saws,"" therefore, I shall content myself with a compendious account of some of the more ""modern instances""."|4|18|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
A very good diddle is this.|0|19|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
A housekeeper in want of a sofa, for instance, is seen to go in and out of several cabinet warehouses.|1|19|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
At length she arrives at one offering an excellent variety.|2|19|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
She is accosted, and invited to enter, by a polite and voluble individual at the door.|3|19|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
She finds a sofa well adapted to her views, and upon inquiring the price, is surprised and delighted to hear a sum named at least twenty per cent.|4|19|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
lower than her expectations.|5|19|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
She hastens to make the purchase, gets a bill and receipt, leaves her address, with a request that the article be sent home as speedily as possible, and retires amid a profusion of bows from the shopkeeper.|6|19|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
The night arrives and no sofa.|7|19|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
A servant is sent to make inquiry about the delay.|8|19|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
The whole transaction is denied.|9|19|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
No sofa has been sold; no money received; except by the diddler, who played shop-keeper for the nonce.|10|19|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Our cabinet warehouses are left entirely unattended, and thus afford every facility for a trick of this kind.|0|20|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Visiters enter, look at furniture, and depart unheeded and unseen.|1|20|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Should any one wish to purchase, or to inquire the price of an article, a bell is at hand, and this is considered amply sufficient.|2|20|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Again, quite a respectable diddle is this.|0|21|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""My dear sir, never mind; just oblige me, will you, by sending the bundle home?"|0|22|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
But stay!|1|22|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
I really believe that I have nothing less than a five dollar bill, even there.|2|22|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"However, you can send four dollars in change with the bundle, you know""."|3|22|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""Very good, sir,"" replies the shop-keeper, who entertains, at once, a lofty opinion of the high-mindedness of his customer."|0|23|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""I know fellows,"" he says to himself, ""who would just have put the goods under their arm, and walked off with a promise to call and pay the dollar as they came by in the afternoon""."|1|23|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
A boy is sent with the parcel and change.|0|24|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""Ah!"|0|25|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
This is my bundle, I see; I thought you had been home with it, long ago.|1|25|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Well, go on!|2|25|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
My wife, Mrs. Trotter, will give you the five dollars; I left instructions with her to that effect.|3|25|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
The change you might as well give to me; I shall want some silver for the Post Office.|4|25|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Very good!|5|25|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
One, two, is this a good quarter?|6|25|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
- three, four; quite right!|7|25|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"Say to Mrs. Trotter that you met me, and be sure now and do not loiter on the way""."|8|25|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
The boy doesn't loiter at all; but he is a very long time in getting back from his errand; for no lady of the precise name of Mrs. Trotter is to be discovered.|0|26|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He consoles himself, however, that he has not been such a fool as to leave the goods without the money, and re-entering his shop with a self-satisfied air, feels sensibly hurt and indignant when his master asks him what has become of the change.|1|26|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
A very simple diddle, indeed, is this.|0|27|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
The captain of a ship, which is about to sail, is presented by an official looking person with an unusually moderate bill of city charges.|1|27|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Glad to get off so easily, and confused by a hundred duties pressing upon him all at once, he discharges the claim forthwith.|2|27|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
In about fifteen minutes, another and less reasonable bill is handed him by one who soon makes it evident that the first collector was a diddler, and the original collection a diddle.|3|27|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
And here, too, is a somewhat similar thing.|0|28|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
A steamboat is casting loose from the wharf.|1|28|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
A traveller, portmanteau in hand, is discovered running toward the wharf, at full speed.|2|28|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Suddenly, he makes a dead halt, stoops, and picks up something from the ground in a very agitated manner.|3|28|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"It is a pocket-book, and; ""Has any gentleman lost a pocketbook""?"|4|28|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
he cries.|5|28|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
No one can say that he has exactly lost a pocket-book; but a great excitement ensues, when the treasure trove is found to be of value.|6|28|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
The boat, however, must not be detained.|7|28|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""Time and tide wait for no man,"" says the captain."|0|29|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""For God's sake, stay only a few minutes,"" says the finder of the book; ""the true claimant will presently appear""."|0|30|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""Can't wait""!"|0|31|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"replies the man in authority; ""cast off there, d'ye hear""?"|1|31|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""What am I to do""?"|0|32|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
asks the finder, in great tribulation.|1|32|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""I am about to leave the country for some years, and I cannot conscientiously retain this large amount in my possession."|2|32|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"I beg your pardon, sir,"" [here he addresses a gentleman on shore,] ""but you have the air of an honest man."|3|32|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Will you confer upon me the favor of taking charge of this pocket-book; I know I can trust you; and of advertising it?|4|32|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
The notes, you see, amount to a very considerable sum.|5|32|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""Me!"|0|33|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
; no, you!|1|33|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"; it was you who found the book""."|2|33|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""Well, if you must have it so; I will take a small reward; just to satisfy your scruples."|0|34|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Let me see; why these notes are all hundreds- bless my soul!|1|34|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""Cast off there""!"|0|35|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
says the captain.|1|35|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""Cast off there""!"|0|37|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
says the captain.|1|37|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""Never mind""!"|0|38|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"cries the gentleman on shore, who has been examining his own pocket-book for the last minute or so; ""never mind!"|1|38|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"I can fix it; here is a fifty on the Bank of North America; throw the book""."|2|38|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
And the over-conscientious finder takes the fifty with marked reluctance, and throws the gentleman the book, as desired, while the steamboat fumes and fizzes on her way.|0|39|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"In about half an hour after her departure, the ""large amount"" is seen to be a ""counterfeit presentment,"" and the whole thing a capital diddle."|1|39|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
A bold diddle is this.|0|40|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
A camp-meeting, or something similar, is to be held at a certain spot which is accessible only by means of a free bridge.|1|40|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
A diddler stations himself upon this bridge, respectfully informs all passers by of the new county law, which establishes a toll of one cent for foot passengers, two for horses and donkeys, and so forth, and so forth.|2|40|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Some grumble but all submit, and the diddler goes home a wealthier man by some fifty or sixty dollars well earned.|3|40|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
This taking a toll from a great crowd of people is an excessively troublesome thing.|4|40|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
A neat diddle is this.|0|41|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
A friend holds one of the diddler's promises to pay, filled up and signed in due form, upon the ordinary blanks printed in red ink.|1|41|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
The diddler purchases one or two dozen of these blanks, and every day dips one of them in his soup, makes his dog jump for it, and finally gives it to him as a bonne bouche.|2|41|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
The note arriving at maturity, the diddler, with the diddler's dog, calls upon the friend, and the promise to pay is made the topic of discussion.|3|41|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
The friend produces it from his escritoire, and is in the act of reaching it to the diddler, when up jumps the diddler's dog and devours it forthwith.|4|41|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
The diddler is not only surprised but vexed and incensed at the absurd behavior of his dog, and expresses his entire readiness to cancel the obligation at any moment when the evidence of the obligation shall be forthcoming.|5|41|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
A very mean diddle is this.|0|42|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
A lady is insulted in the street by a diddler's accomplice.|1|42|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
The diddler himself flies to her assistance, and, giving his friend a comfortable thrashing, insists upon attending the lady to her own door.|2|42|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He bows, with his hand upon his heart, and most respectfully bids her adieu.|3|42|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
She entreats him, as her deliverer, to walk in and be introduced to her big brother and her papa.|4|42|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
With a sigh, he declines to do so.|5|42|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""Is there no way, then, sir,"" she murmurs, ""in which I may be permitted to testify my gratitude""?"|6|42|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""Why, yes, madam, there is."|0|43|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"Will you be kind enough to lend me a couple of shillings""?"|1|43|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
In the first excitement of the moment the lady decides upon fainting outright.|0|44|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Upon second thought, however, she opens her purse-strings and delivers the specie.|1|44|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Now this, I say, is a diddle minute; for one entire moiety of the sum borrowed has to be paid to the gentleman who had the trouble of performing the insult, and who had then to stand still and be thrashed for performing it.|2|44|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Rather a small but still a scientific diddle is this.|0|45|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
The diddler approaches the bar of a tavern, and demands a couple of twists of tobacco.|1|45|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""I don't much like this tobacco."|0|46|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"Here, take it back, and give me a glass of brandy and water in its place""."|1|46|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
The brandy and water is furnished and imbibed, and the diddler makes his way to the door.|2|46|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
But the voice of the tavern-keeper arrests him.|3|46|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""I believe, sir, you have forgotten to pay for your brandy and water""."|0|47|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""Pay for my brandy and water!"|0|48|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
; didn't I give you the tobacco for the brandy and water?|1|48|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"What more would you have""?"|2|48|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""But, sir, if you please, I don't remember that you paid me for the tobacco""."|0|49|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""What do you mean by that, you scoundrel?"|0|50|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
; Didn't I give you back your tobacco?|1|50|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Isn't that your tobacco lying there?|2|50|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"Do you expect me to pay for what I did not take""?"|3|50|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""But me no buts, sir,"" interrupts the diddler, apparently in very high dudgeon, and slamming the door after him, as he makes his escape."|0|52|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"; ""But me no buts, sir, and none of your tricks upon travellers""."|1|52|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Here again is a very clever diddle, of which the simplicity is not its least recommendation.|0|53|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
A purse, or pocket-book, being really lost, the loser inserts in one of the daily papers of a large city a fully descriptive advertisement.|1|53|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Whereupon our diddler copies the facts of this advertisement, with a change of heading, of general phraseology and address.|0|54|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"The original, for instance, is long, and verbose, is headed ""A Pocket-Book Lost""!"|1|54|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
and requires the treasure, when found, to be left at No.|2|54|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
1 Tom Street.|3|54|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"The copy is brief, and being headed with ""Lost"" only, indicates No."|4|54|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
2 Dick, or No.|5|54|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
3 Harry Street, as the locality at which the owner may be seen.|6|54|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Moreover, it is inserted in at least five or six of the daily papers of the day, while in point of time, it makes its appearance only a few hours after the original.|7|54|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Should it be read by the loser of the purse, he would hardly suspect it to have any reference to his own misfortune.|8|54|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
But, of course, the chances are five or six to one, that the finder will repair to the address given by the diddler, rather than to that pointed out by the rightful proprietor.|9|54|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
The former pays the reward, pockets the treasure and decamps.|10|54|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Quite an analogous diddle is this.|0|55|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
A lady of ton has dropped, some where in the street, a diamond ring of very unusual value.|1|55|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
For its recovery, she offers some forty or fifty dollars reward; giving, in her advertisement, a very minute description of the gem, and of its settings, and declaring that, on its restoration at No.|2|55|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
so and so, in such and such Avenue, the reward would be paid instanter, without a single question being asked.|3|55|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
During the lady's absence from home, a day or two afterwards, a ring is heard at the door of No.|4|55|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
so and so, in such and such Avenue; a servant appears; the lady of the house is asked for and is declared to be out, at which astounding information, the visitor expresses the most poignant regret.|5|55|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
His business is of importance and concerns the lady herself.|6|55|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
In fact, he had the good fortune to find her diamond ring.|7|55|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
But perhaps it would be as well that he should call again.|8|55|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""By no means""!"|9|55|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"says the servant; and ""By no means""!"|10|55|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
says the lady's sister and the lady's sister-in-law, who are summoned forthwith.|11|55|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
The ring is clamorously identified, the reward is paid, and the finder nearly thrust out of doors.|12|55|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
The lady returns and expresses some little dissatisfaction with her sister and sister-in-law, because they happen to have paid forty or fifty dollars for a fac-simile of her diamond ring; a fac-simile made out of real pinch-beck and unquestionable paste.|13|55|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
But as there is really no end to diddling, so there would be none to this essay, were I even to hint at half the variations, or inflections, of which this science is susceptible.|0|56|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
I must bring this paper, perforce, to a conclusion, and this I cannot do better than by a summary notice of a very decent, but rather elaborate diddle, of which our own city was made the theatre, not very long ago, and which was subsequently repeated with success, in other still more verdant localities of the Union.|1|56|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
A middle-aged gentleman arrives in town from parts unknown.|2|56|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He is remarkably precise, cautious, staid, and deliberate in his demeanor.|3|56|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
His dress is scrupulously neat, but plain, unostentatious.|4|56|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He wears a white cravat, an ample waistcoat, made with an eye to comfort alone; thick-soled cosy-looking shoes, and pantaloons without straps.|5|56|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"He has the whole air, in fact, of your well-to-do, sober-sided, exact, and respectable ""man of business,"" Par excellence; one of the stern and outwardly hard, internally soft, sort of people that we see in the crack high comedies; fellows whose words are so many bonds, and who are noted for giving away guineas, in charity, with the one hand, while, in the way of mere bargain, they exact the uttermost fraction of a farthing with the other."|6|56|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He makes much ado before he can get suited with a boarding house.|0|57|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He dislikes children.|1|57|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
He has been accustomed to quiet.|2|57|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
His habits are methodical; and then he would prefer getting into a private and respectable small family, piously inclined.|3|57|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Terms, however, are no object; only he must insist upon settling his bill on the first of every month, (it is now the second) and begs his landlady, when he finally obtains one to his mind, not on any account to forget his instructions upon this point; but to send in a bill, and receipt, precisely at ten o'clock, on the first day of every month, and under no circumstances to put it off to the second.|4|57|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
These arrangements made, our man of business rents an office in a reputable rather than a fashionable quarter of the town.|0|58|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
There is nothing he more despises than pretense.|1|58|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""Where there is much show,"" he says, ""there is seldom any thing very solid behind""; an observation which so profoundly impresses his landlady's fancy, that she makes a pencil memorandum of it forthwith, in her great family Bible, on the broad margin of the Proverbs of Solomon."|2|58|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"The next step is to advertise, after some such fashion as this, in the principal business six-pennies of the city; the pennies are eschewed as not ""respectable""; and as demanding payment for all advertisements in advance."|0|59|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Our man of business holds it as a point of his faith that work should never be paid for until done.|1|59|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"""WANTED; The advertisers, being about to commence extensive business operations in this city, will require the services of three or four intelligent and competent clerks, to whom a liberal salary will be paid."|0|60|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
The very best recommendations, not so much for capacity, as for integrity, will be expected.|1|60|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Indeed, as the duties to be performed involve high responsibilities, and large amounts of money must necessarily pass through the hands of those engaged, it is deemed advisable to demand a deposit of fifty dollars from each clerk employed.|2|60|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
No person need apply, therefore, who is not prepared to leave this sum in the possession of the advertisers, and who cannot furnish the most satisfactory testimonials of morality.|3|60|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Young gentlemen piously inclined will be preferred.|4|60|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Application should be made between the hours of ten and eleven A. M., and four and five P. M., of Messrs.|5|60|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
By the thirty-first day of the month, this advertisement has brought to the office of Messrs.|0|61|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
Bogs, Hogs, Logs, Frogs, and Company, some fifteen or twenty young gentlemen piously inclined.|1|61|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
But our man of business is in no hurry to conclude a contract with any; no man of business is ever precipitate; and it is not until the most rigid catechism in respect to the piety of each young gentleman's inclination, that his services are engaged and his fifty dollars receipted for, just by way of proper precaution, on the part of the respectable firm of Bogs, Hogs, Logs, Frogs, and Company.|2|61|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
On the morning of the first day of the next month, the landlady does not present her bill, according to promise; a piece of neglect for which the comfortable head of the house ending in ogs would no doubt have chided her severely, could he have been prevailed upon to remain in town a day or two for that purpose.|3|61|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"As it is, the constables have had a sad time of it, running hither and thither, and all they can do is to declare the man of business most emphatically, a ""hen knee high""; by which some persons imagine them to imply that, in fact, he is n."|0|62|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
e.|1|62|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
i.|2|62|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
; by which again the very classical phrase non est inventus, is supposed to be understood.|3|62|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
In the meantime the young gentlemen, one and all, are somewhat less piously inclined than before, while the landlady purchases a shilling's worth of the Indian rubber, and very carefully obliterates the pencil memorandum that some fool has made in her great family Bible, on the broad margin of the Proverbs of Solomon.|4|62|Diddling|October 14, 1843|Parody
"MANY years ago, it was the fashion to ridicule the idea of ""love at first sight;"" but those who think, not less than those who feel deeply, have always advocated its existence."|0|0|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Modern discoveries, indeed, in what may be termed ethical magnetism or magnetoesthetics, render it probable that the most natural, and, consequently, the truest and most intense of the human affections are those which arise in the heart as if by electric sympathy–in a word, that the brightest and most enduring of the psychal fetters are those which are riveted by a glance.|1|0|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The confession I am about to make will add another to the already almost innumerable instances of the truth of the position.|2|0|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
My story requires that I should be somewhat minute.|0|1|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I am still a very young man–not yet twenty-two years of age.|1|1|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
My name, at present, is a very usual and rather plebeian one–Simpson.|2|1|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"I say ""at present;"" for it is only lately that I have been so called–having legislatively adopted this surname within the last year in order to receive a large inheritance left me by a distant male relative, Adolphus Simpson, Esq."|3|1|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The bequest was conditioned upon my taking the name of the testator,–the family, not the Christian name; my Christian name is Napoleon Bonaparte–or, more properly, these are my first and middle appellations.|4|1|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"I assumed the name, Simpson, with some reluctance, as in my true patronym, Froissart, I felt a very pardonable pride–believing that I could trace a descent from the immortal author of the ""Chronicles""."|0|2|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
While on the subject of names, by the bye, I may mention a singular coincidence of sound attending the names of some of my immediate predecessors.|1|2|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
My father was a Monsieur Froissart, of Paris.|2|2|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
His wife–my mother, whom he married at fifteen–was a Mademoiselle Croissart, eldest daughter of Croissart the banker, whose wife, again, being only sixteen when married, was the eldest daughter of one Victor Voissart.|3|2|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Monsieur Voissart, very singularly, had married a lady of similar name–a Mademoiselle Moissart.|4|2|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
She, too, was quite a child when married; and her mother, also, Madame Moissart, was only fourteen when led to the altar.|5|2|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
These early marriages are usual in France.|6|2|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Here, however, are Moissart, Voissart, Croissart, and Froissart, all in the direct line of descent.|7|2|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
My own name, though, as I say, became Simpson, by act of Legislature, and with so much repugnance on my part, that, at one period, I actually hesitated about accepting the legacy with the useless and annoying proviso attached.|8|2|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
As to personal endowments, I am by no means deficient.|0|3|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor

My hair is black and curling.|3|3|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
My nose is sufficiently good.|4|3|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
My eyes are large and gray; and although, in fact they are weak a very inconvenient degree, still no defect in this regard would be suspected from their appearance.|5|3|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The weakness itself, however, has always much annoyed me, and I have resorted to every remedy–short of wearing glasses.|6|3|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Being youthful and good-looking, I naturally dislike these, and have resolutely refused to employ them.|7|3|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I know nothing, indeed, which so disfigures the countenance of a young person, or so impresses every feature with an air of demureness, if not altogether of sanctimoniousness and of age.|8|3|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor

One night last winter I entered a box at the P-–Theatre, in company with a friend, Mr. Talbot.|0|4|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
It was an opera night, and the bills presented a very rare attraction, so that the house was excessively crowded.|1|4|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
We were in time, however, to obtain the front seats which had been reserved for us, and into which, with some little difficulty, we elbowed our way.|2|4|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
For two hours my companion, who was a musical fanatico, gave his undivided attention to the stage; and, in the meantime, I amused myself by observing the audience, which consisted, in chief part, of the very elite of the city.|0|5|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Having satisfied myself upon this point, I was about turning my eyes to the prima donna, when they were arrested and riveted by a figure in one of the private boxes which had escaped my observation.|1|5|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
If I live a thousand years, I can never forget the intense emotion with which I regarded this figure.|0|6|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
It was that of a female, the most exquisite I had ever beheld.|1|6|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"The face was so far turned toward the stage that, for some minutes, I could not obtain a view of it–but the form was divine; no other word can sufficiently express its magnificent proportion–and even the term ""divine"" seems ridiculously feeble as I write it."|2|6|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The magic of a lovely form in woman–the necromancy of female gracefulness–was always a power which I had found it impossible to resist, but here was grace personified, incarnate, the beau ideal of my wildest and most enthusiastic visions.|0|7|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The figure, almost all of which the construction of the box permitted to be seen, was somewhat above the medium height, and nearly approached, without positively reaching, the majestic.|1|7|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Its perfect fullness and tournure were delicious.|2|7|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The head of which only the back was visible, rivalled in outline that of the Greek Psyche, and was rather displayed than concealed by an elegant cap of gaze aerienne, which put me in mind of the ventum textilem of Apuleius.|3|7|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The right arm hung over the balustrade of the box, and thrilled every nerve of my frame with its exquisite symmetry.|4|7|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Its upper portion was draperied by one of the loose open sleeves now in fashion.|5|7|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
This extended but little below the elbow.|6|7|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Beneath it was worn an under one of some frail material, close-fitting, and terminated by a cuff of rich lace, which fell gracefully over the top of the hand, revealing only the delicate fingers, upon one of which sparkled a diamond ring, which I at once saw was of extraordinary value.|7|7|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The admirable roundness of the wrist was well set off by a bracelet which encircled it, and which also was ornamented and clasped by a magnificent aigrette of jewels-telling, in words that could not be mistaken, at once of the wealth and fastidious taste of the wearer.|8|7|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"I gazed at this queenly apparition for at least half an hour, as if I had been suddenly converted to stone; and, during this period, I felt the full force and truth of all that has been said or sung concerning ""love at first sight""."|0|8|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
My feelings were totally different from any which I had hitherto experienced, in the presence of even the most celebrated specimens of female loveliness.|1|8|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
An unaccountable, and what I am compelled to consider a magnetic, sympathy of soul for soul, seemed to rivet, not only my vision, but my whole powers of thought and feeling, upon the admirable object before me.|2|8|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I saw–I felt–I knew that I was deeply, madly, irrevocably in love–and this even before seeing the face of the person beloved.|3|8|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
So intense, indeed, was the passion that consumed me, that I really believe it would have received little if any abatement had the features, yet unseen, proved of merely ordinary character, so anomalous is the nature of the only true love–of the love at first sight–and so little really dependent is it upon the external conditions which only seem to create and control it.|4|8|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
While I was thus wrapped in admiration of this lovely vision, a sudden disturbance among the audience caused her to turn her head partially toward me, so that I beheld the entire profile of the face.|0|9|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Its beauty even exceeded my anticipations–and yet there was something about it which disappointed me without my being able to tell exactly what it was.|1|9|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"I said ""disappointed,"" but this is not altogether the word."|2|9|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
My sentiments were at once quieted and exalted.|3|9|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
They partook less of transport and more of calm enthusiasm of enthusiastic repose.|4|9|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
This state of feeling arose, perhaps, from the Madonna-like and matronly air of the face; and yet I at once understood that it could not have arisen entirely from this.|5|9|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
There was something else- some mystery which I could not develope–some expression about the countenance which slightly disturbed me while it greatly heightened my interest.|6|9|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
In fact, I was just in that condition of mind which prepares a young and susceptible man for any act of extravagance.|7|9|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Had the lady been alone, I should undoubtedly have entered her box and accosted her at all hazards; but, fortunately, she was attended by two companions–a gentleman, and a strikingly beautiful woman, to all appearance a few years younger than herself.|8|9|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I revolved in my mind a thousand schemes by which I might obtain, hereafter, an introduction to the elder lady, or, for the present, at all events, a more distinct view of her beauty.|0|10|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I would have removed my position to one nearer her own, but the crowded state of the theatre rendered this impossible; and the stern decrees of Fashion had, of late, imperatively prohibited the use of the opera-glass in a case such as this, even had I been so fortunate as to have one with me–but I had not–and was thus in despair.|1|10|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
At length I bethought me of applying to my companion.|0|11|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Talbot,"" I said, ""you have an opera-glass."|0|12|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"Let me have it""."|1|12|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""An opera–glass!"|0|13|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
–no!|1|13|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"–what do you suppose I would be doing with an opera-glass""?"|2|13|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Here he turned impatiently toward the stage.|3|13|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""But, Talbot,"" I continued, pulling him by the shoulder, ""listen to me will you?"|0|14|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Do you see the stage–box?|1|14|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
–there!|2|14|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
–no, the next.|3|14|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"–did you ever behold as lovely a woman""?"|4|14|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""She is very beautiful, no doubt,"" he said."|0|15|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""I wonder who she can be""?"|0|16|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Why, in the name of all that is angelic, don't you know who she is?"|0|17|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
'Not to know her argues yourself unknown.|1|17|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
' She is the celebrated Madame Lalande–the beauty of the day par excellence, and the talk of the whole town.|2|17|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"Immensely wealthy too–a widow, and a great match–has just arrived from Paris""."|3|17|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Do you know her""?"|0|18|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Yes; I have the honor""."|0|19|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Will you introduce me""?"|0|20|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Assuredly, with the greatest pleasure; when shall it be""?"|0|21|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""To-morrow, at one, I will call upon you at B--'s."|0|22|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Very good; and now do hold your tongue, if you can""."|0|23|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
In this latter respect I was forced to take Talbot's advice; for he remained obstinately deaf to every further question or suggestion, and occupied himself exclusively for the rest of the evening with what was transacting upon the stage.|0|24|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
In the meantime I kept my eyes riveted on Madame Lalande, and at length had the good fortune to obtain a full front view of her face.|0|25|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
It was exquisitely lovely–this, of course, my heart had told me before, even had not Talbot fully satisfied me upon the point–but still the unintelligible something disturbed me.|1|25|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I finally concluded that my senses were impressed by a certain air of gravity, sadness, or, still more properly, of weariness, which took something from the youth and freshness of the countenance, only to endow it with a seraphic tenderness and majesty, and thus, of course, to my enthusiastic and romantic temperment, with an interest tenfold.|2|25|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
While I thus feasted my eyes, I perceived, at last, to my great trepidation, by an almost imperceptible start on the part of the lady, that she had become suddenly aware of the intensity of my gaze.|0|26|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Still, I was absolutely fascinated, and could not withdraw it, even for an instant.|1|26|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
She turned aside her face, and again I saw only the chiselled contour of the back portion of the head.|2|26|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
After some minutes, as if urged by curiosity to see if I was still looking, she gradually brought her face again around and again encountered my burning gaze.|3|26|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Her large dark eyes fell instantly, and a deep blush mantled her cheek.|4|26|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
But what was my astonishment at perceiving that she not only did not a second time avert her head, but that she actually took from her girdle a double eyeglass–elevated it–adjusted it–and then regarded me through it, intently and deliberately, for the space of several minutes.|5|26|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Had a thunderbolt fAllan at my feet I could not have been more thoroughly astounded–astounded only–not offended or disgusted in the slightest degree; although an action so bold in any other woman would have been likely to offend or disgust.|0|27|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
But the whole thing was done with so much quietude–so much nonchalance–so much repose- with so evident an air of the highest breeding, in short–that nothing of mere effrontery was perceptible, and my sole sentiments were those of admiration and surprise.|1|27|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I observed that, upon her first elevation of the glass, she had seemed satisfied with a momentary inspection of my person, and was withdrawing the instrument, when, as if struck by a second thought, she resumed it, and so continued to regard me with fixed attention for the space of several minutes–for five minutes, at the very least, I am sure.|0|28|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
This action, so remarkable in an American theatre, attracted very general observation, and gave rise to an indefinite movement, or buzz, among the audience, which for a moment filled me with confusion, but produced no visible effect upon the countenance of Madame Lalande.|0|29|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Having satisfied her curiosity–if such it was–she dropped the glass, and quietly gave her attention again to the stage; her profile now being turned toward myself, as before.|0|30|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I continued to watch her unremittingly, although I was fully conscious of my rudeness in so doing.|1|30|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Presently I saw the head slowly and slightly change its position; and soon I became convinced that the lady, while pretending to look at the stage was, in fact, attentively regarding myself.|2|30|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
It is needless to say what effect this conduct, on the part of so fascinating a woman, had upon my excitable mind.|3|30|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Having thus scrutinized me for perhaps a quarter of an hour, the fair object of my passion addressed the gentleman who attended her, and while she spoke, I saw distinctly, by the glances of both, that the conversation had reference to myself.|0|31|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Upon its conclusion, Madame Lalande again turned toward the stage, and, for a few minutes, seemed absorbed in the performance.|0|32|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
At the expiration of this period, however, I was thrown into an extremity of agitation by seeing her unfold, for the second time, the eye-glass which hung at her side, fully confront me as before, and, disregarding the renewed buzz of the audience, survey me, from head to foot, with the same miraculous composure which had previously so delighted and confounded my soul.|1|32|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
This extraordinary behavior, by throwing me into a perfect fever of excitement–into an absolute delirium of love-served rather to embolden than to disconcert me.|0|33|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
In the mad intensity of my devotion, I forgot everything but the presence and the majestic loveliness of the vision which confronted my gaze.|1|33|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Watching my opportunity, when I thought the audience were fully engaged with the opera, I at length caught the eyes of Madame Lalande, and, upon the instant, made a slight but unmistakable bow.|2|33|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
She blushed very deeply–then averted her eyes–then slowly and cautiously looked around, apparently to see if my rash action had been noticed–then leaned over toward the gentleman who sat by her side.|0|34|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I now felt a burning sense of the impropriety I had committed, and expected nothing less than instant exposure; while a vision of pistols upon the morrow floated rapidly and uncomfortably through my brain.|0|35|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I was greatly and immediately relieved, however, when I saw the lady merely hand the gentleman a play-bill, without speaking, but the reader may form some feeble conception of my astonishment–of my profound amazement–my delirious bewilderment of heart and soul–when, instantly afterward, having again glanced furtively around, she allowed her bright eyes to set fully and steadily upon my own, and then, with a faint smile, disclosing a bright line of her pearly teeth, made two distinct, pointed, and unequivocal affirmative inclinations of the head.|1|35|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
It is useless, of course, to dwell upon my joy–upon my transport- upon my illimitable ecstasy of heart.|0|36|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
If ever man was mad with excess of happiness, it was myself at that moment.|1|36|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I loved.|2|36|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
This was my first love–so I felt it to be.|3|36|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
It was love supreme-indescribable.|4|36|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"It was ""love at first sight;"" and at first sight, too, it had been appreciated and returned."|5|36|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Yes, returned.|0|37|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
How and why should I doubt it for an instant.|1|37|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
What other construction could I possibly put upon such conduct, on the part of a lady so beautiful–so wealthy–evidently so accomplished–of so high breeding–of so lofty a position in society–in every regard so entirely respectable as I felt assured was Madame Lalande?|2|37|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Yes, she loved me–she returned the enthusiasm of my love, with an enthusiasm as blind–as uncompromising–as uncalculating–as abandoned–and as utterly unbounded as my own!|3|37|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
These delicious fancies and reflections, however, were now interrupted by the falling of the drop-curtain.|4|37|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The audience arose; and the usual tumult immediately supervened.|5|37|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Quitting Talbot abruptly, I made every effort to force my way into closer proximity with Madame Lalande.|6|37|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Having failed in this, on account of the crowd, I at length gave up the chase, and bent my steps homeward; consoling myself for my disappointment in not having been able to touch even the hem of her robe, by the reflection that I should be introduced by Talbot, in due form, upon the morrow.|7|37|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"This morrow at last came, that is to say, a day finally dawned upon a long and weary night of impatience; and then the hours until ""one"" were snail-paced, dreary, and innumerable."|0|38|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
But even Stamboul, it is said, shall have an end, and there came an end to this long delay.|1|38|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The clock struck.|2|38|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
As the last echo ceased, I stepped into B--'s and inquired for Talbot.|3|38|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Out,"" said the footman–Talbot's own."|0|39|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Out""!"|0|40|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"I replied, staggering back half a dozen paces–""let me tell you, my fine fellow, that this thing is thoroughly impossible and impracticable; Mr. Talbot is not out."|1|40|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"What do you mean""?"|2|40|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Nothing, sir; only Mr. Talbot is not in, that's all."|0|41|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"He rode over to S--, immediately after breakfast, and left word that he would not be in town again for a week""."|1|41|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I stood petrified with horror and rage.|0|42|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I endeavored to reply, but my tongue refused its office.|1|42|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
At length I turned on my heel, livid with wrath, and inwardly consigning the whole tribe of the Talbots to the innermost regions of Erebus.|2|42|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
It was evident that my considerate friend, il fanatico, had quite forgotten his appointment with myself–had forgotten it as soon as it was made.|3|42|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
At no time was he a very scrupulous man of his word.|4|42|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
There was no help for it; so smothering my vexation as well as I could, I strolled moodily up the street, propounding futile inquiries about Madame Lalande to every male acquaintance I met.|5|42|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
By report she was known, I found, to all- to many by sight–but she had been in town only a few weeks, and there were very few, therefore, who claimed her personal acquaintance.|6|42|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
These few, being still comparatively strangers, could not, or would not, take the liberty of introducing me through the formality of a morning call.|7|42|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
While I stood thus in despair, conversing with a trio of friends upon the all absorbing subject of my heart, it so happened that the subject itself passed by.|8|42|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""As I live, there she is""!"|0|43|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
cried one.|1|43|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Surprisingly beautiful""!"|0|44|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
exclaimed a second.|1|44|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""An angel upon earth""!"|0|45|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
ejaculated a third.|1|45|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I looked; and in an open carriage which approached us, passing slowly down the street, sat the enchanting vision of the opera, accompanied by the younger lady who had occupied a portion of her box.|0|46|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Her companion also wears remarkably well,"" said the one of my trio who had spoken first."|0|47|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Astonishingly,"" said the second; ""still quite a brilliant air, but art will do wonders."|0|48|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Upon my word, she looks better than she did at Paris five years ago.|1|48|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
A beautiful woman still;–don't you think so, Froissart?|2|48|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"–Simpson, I mean""."|3|48|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Still""!"|0|49|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"said I, ""and why shouldn't she be?"|1|49|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
But compared with her friend she is as a rush–light to the evening star–a glow–worm to Antares.|2|49|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Ha!"|0|50|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
ha!|1|50|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
ha!|2|50|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"–why, Simpson, you have an astonishing tact at making discoveries–original ones, I mean""."|3|50|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
A bas Ninon De L'Enclos!|0|52|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
During this little scene, however, one thing had served greatly to console me, although it fed the passion by which I was consumed.|0|53|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
As the carriage of Madame Lalande rolled by our group, I had observed that she recognized me; and more than this, she had blessed me, by the most seraphic of all imaginable smiles, with no equivocal mark of the recognition.|1|53|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
As for an introduction, I was obliged to abandon all hope of it until such time as Talbot should think proper to return from the country.|0|54|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
In the meantime I perseveringly frequented every reputable place of public amusement; and, at length, at the theatre, where I first saw her, I had the supreme bliss of meeting her, and of exchanging glances with her once again.|1|54|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
This did not occur, however, until the lapse of a fortnight.|2|54|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"Every day, in the interim, I had inquired for Talbot at his hotel, and every day had been thrown into a spasm of wrath by the everlasting ""Not come home yet"" of his footman."|3|54|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Upon the evening in question, therefore, I was in a condition little short of madness.|0|55|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Madame Lalande, I had been told, was a Parisian–had lately arrived from Paris–might she not suddenly return?|1|55|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
–return before Talbot came back–and might she not be thus lost to me forever?|2|55|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The thought was too terrible to bear.|3|55|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Since my future happiness was at issue, I resolved to act with a manly decision.|4|55|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
In a word, upon the breaking up of the play, I traced the lady to her residence, noted the address, and the next morning sent her a full and elaborate letter, in which I poured out my whole heart.|5|55|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I spoke boldly, freely–in a word, I spoke with passion.|0|56|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I concealed nothing–nothing even of my weakness.|1|56|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I alluded to the romantic circumstances of our first meeting–even to the glances which had passed between us.|2|56|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I went so far as to say that I felt assured of her love; while I offered this assurance, and my own intensity of devotion, as two excuses for my otherwise unpardonable conduct.|3|56|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
As a third, I spoke of my fear that she might quit the city before I could have the opportunity of a formal introduction.|4|56|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I concluded the most wildly enthusiastic epistle ever penned, with a frank declaration of my worldly circumstances–of my affluence–and with an offer of my heart and of my hand.|5|56|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
In an agony of expectation I awaited the reply.|0|57|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
After what seemed the lapse of a century it came.|1|57|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Yes, actually came.|0|58|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Romantic as all this may appear, I really received a letter from Madame Lalande–the beautiful, the wealthy, the idolized Madame Lalande.|1|58|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Her eyes–her magnificent eyes, had not belied her noble heart.|2|58|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Like a true Frenchwoman as she was she had obeyed the frank dictates of her reason–the generous impulses of her nature–despising the conventional pruderies of the world.|3|58|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
She had not scorned my proposals.|4|58|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
She had not sheltered herself in silence.|5|58|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
She had not returned my letter unopened.|6|58|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
She had even sent me, in reply, one penned by her own exquisite fingers.|7|58|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Monsieur Simpson vill pardonne me for not compose de butefulle tong of his contree so vell as might."|0|59|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor

"""Vid dis apologie for the maniere, I vill now say dat, helas!"|0|60|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor

Need I say de more?|2|60|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Helas!|3|60|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor

"""EUGENIE LALAND""."|0|61|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
This noble–spirited note I kissed a million times, and committed, no doubt, on its account, a thousand other extravagances that have now escaped my memory.|0|62|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Still Talbot would not return.|1|62|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Alas!|2|62|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
could he have formed even the vaguest idea of the suffering his absence had occasioned his friend, would not his sympathizing nature have flown immediately to my relief?|3|62|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Still, however, he came not.|4|62|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I wrote.|5|62|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
He replied.|6|62|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
He was detained by urgent business–but would shortly return.|7|62|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
He begged me not to be impatient–to moderate my transports–to read soothing books–to drink nothing stronger than Hock–and to bring the consolations of philosophy to my aid.|8|62|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The fool!|9|62|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
if he could not come himself, why, in the name of every thing rational, could he not have enclosed me a letter of presentation?|10|62|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I wrote him again, entreating him to forward one forthwith.|11|62|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
My letter was returned by that footman, with the following endorsement in pencil.|12|62|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Left S-–yesterday, for parts unknown–did not say where–or when be back–so thought best to return letter, knowing your handwriting, and as how you is always, more or less, in a hurry."|0|63|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""STUBBS""."|0|65|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
After this, it is needless to say, that I devoted to the infernal deities both master and valet:–but there was little use in anger, and no consolation at all in complaint.|0|66|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
But I had yet a resource left, in my constitutional audacity.|0|67|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Hitherto it had served me well, and I now resolved to make it avail me to the end.|1|67|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Besides, after the correspondence which had passed between us, what act of mere informality could I commit, within bounds, that ought to be regarded as indecorous by Madame Lalande?|2|67|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Since the affair of the letter, I had been in the habit of watching her house, and thus discovered that, about twilight, it was her custom to promenade, attended only by a negro in livery, in a public square overlooked by her windows.|3|67|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Here, amid the luxuriant and shadowing groves, in the gray gloom of a sweet midsummer evening, I observed my opportunity and accosted her.|4|67|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The better to deceive the servant in attendance, I did this with the assured air of an old and familiar acquaintance.|0|68|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
With a presence of mind truly Parisian, she took the cue at once, and, to greet me, held out the most bewitchingly little of hands.|1|68|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The valet at once fell into the rear, and now, with hearts full to overflowing, we discoursed long and unreservedly of our love.|2|68|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
As Madame Lalande spoke English even less fluently than she wrote it, our conversation was necessarily in French.|0|69|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
In this sweet tongue, so adapted to passion, I gave loose to the impetuous enthusiasm of my nature, and, with all the eloquence I could command, besought her to consent to an immediate marriage.|1|69|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
At this impatience she smiled.|0|70|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
She urged the old story of decorum- that bug-bear which deters so many from bliss until the opportunity for bliss has forever gone by.|1|70|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I had most imprudently made it known among my friends, she observed, that I desired her acquaintance- thus that I did not possess it–thus, again, there was no possibility of concealing the date of our first knowledge of each other.|2|70|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
And then she adverted, with a blush, to the extreme recency of this date.|3|70|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
To wed immediately would be improper–would be indecorous–would be outre.|4|70|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
All this she said with a charming air of naivete which enraptured while it grieved and convinced me.|5|70|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
She went even so far as to accuse me, laughingly, of rashness–of imprudence.|6|70|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
She bade me remember that I really even know not who she was–what were her prospects, her connections, her standing in society.|7|70|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
She begged me, but with a sigh, to reconsider my proposal, and termed my love an infatuation–a will o' the wisp–a fancy or fantasy of the moment–a baseless and unstable creation rather of the imagination than of the heart.|8|70|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
These things she uttered as the shadows of the sweet twilight gathered darkly and more darkly around us–and then, with a gentle pressure of her fairy-like hand, overthrew, in a single sweet instant, all the argumentative fabric she had reared.|9|70|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I replied as best I could–as only a true lover can.|0|71|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I spoke at length, and perseveringly of my devotion, of my passion–of her exceeding beauty, and of my own enthusiastic admiration.|1|71|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
In conclusion, I dwelt, with a convincing energy, upon the perils that encompass the course of love–that course of true love that never did run smooth–and thus deduced the manifest danger of rendering that course unnecessarily long.|2|71|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
This latter argument seemed finally to soften the rigor of her determination.|0|72|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
She relented; but there was yet an obstacle, she said, which she felt assured I had not properly considered.|1|72|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
This was a delicate point–for a woman to urge, especially so; in mentioning it, she saw that she must make a sacrifice of her feelings; still, for me, every sacrifice should be made.|2|72|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
She alluded to the topic of age.|3|72|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Was I aware–was I fully aware of the discrepancy between us?|4|72|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
That the age of the husband, should surpass by a few years–even by fifteen or twenty–the age of the wife, was regarded by the world as admissible, and, indeed, as even proper, but she had always entertained the belief that the years of the wife should never exceed in number those of the husband.|5|72|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
A discrepancy of this unnatural kind gave rise, too frequently, alas!|6|72|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
to a life of unhappiness.|7|72|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Now she was aware that my own age did not exceed two and twenty; and I, on the contrary, perhaps, was not aware that the years of my Eugenie extended very considerably beyond that sum.|8|72|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
About all this there was a nobility of soul–a dignity of candor- which delighted–which enchanted me–which eternally riveted my chains.|0|73|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I could scarcely restrain the excessive transport which possessed me.|1|73|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""My sweetest Eugenie,"" I cried, ""what is all this about which you are discoursing?"|0|74|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Your years surpass in some measure my own.|1|74|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
But what then?|2|74|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The customs of the world are so many conventional follies.|3|74|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
To those who love as ourselves, in what respect differs a year from an hour?|4|74|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I am twenty-two, you say, granted: indeed, you may as well call me, at once, twenty-three.|5|74|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Here I paused for an instant, in the expectation that Madame Lalande would interrupt me by supplying her true age.|0|75|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
But a Frenchwoman is seldom direct, and has always, by way of answer to an embarrassing query, some little practical reply of her own.|1|75|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
In the present instance, Eugenie, who for a few moments past had seemed to be searching for something in her bosom, at length let fall upon the grass a miniature, which I immediately picked up and presented to her.|2|75|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Keep it""!"|0|76|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
she said, with one of her most ravishing smiles.|1|76|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Keep it for my sake–for the sake of her whom it too flatteringly represents."|2|76|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Besides, upon the back of the trinket you may discover, perhaps, the very information you seem to desire.|3|76|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
It is now, to be sure, growing rather dark–but you can examine it at your leisure in the morning.|4|76|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
In the meantime, you shall be my escort home to-night.|5|76|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
My friends are about holding a little musical levee.|6|76|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I can promise you, too, some good singing.|7|76|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"We French are not nearly so punctilious as you Americans, and I shall have no difficulty in smuggling you in, in the character of an old acquaintance""."|8|76|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
With this, she took my arm, and I attended her home.|0|77|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The mansion was quite a fine one, and, I believe, furnished in good taste.|1|77|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Of this latter point, however, I am scarcely qualified to judge; for it was just dark as we arrived; and in American mansions of the better sort lights seldom, during the heat of summer, make their appearance at this, the most pleasant period of the day.|2|77|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
In about an hour after my arrival, to be sure, a single shaded solar lamp was lit in the principal drawing-room; and this apartment, I could thus see, was arranged with unusual good taste and even splendor; but two other rooms of the suite, and in which the company chiefly assembled, remained, during the whole evening, in a very agreeable shadow.|3|77|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
This is a well-conceived custom, giving the party at least a choice of light or shade, and one which our friends over the water could not do better than immediately adopt.|4|77|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The evening thus spent was unquestionably the most delicious of my life.|0|78|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Madame Lalande had not overrated the musical abilities of her friends; and the singing I here heard I had never heard excelled in any private circle out of Vienna.|1|78|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The instrumental performers were many and of superior talents.|2|78|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The vocalists were chiefly ladies, and no individual sang less than well.|3|78|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"At length, upon a peremptory call for ""Madame Lalande,"" she arose at once, without affectation or demur, from the chaise longue upon which she had sat by my side, and, accompanied by one or two gentlemen and her female friend of the opera, repaired to the piano in the main drawing-room."|4|78|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I would have escorted her myself, but felt that, under the circumstances of my introduction to the house, I had better remain unobserved where I was.|5|78|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I was thus deprived of the pleasure of seeing, although not of hearing, her sing.|6|78|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The impression she produced upon the company seemed electrical but the effect upon myself was something even more.|0|79|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I know not how adequately to describe it.|1|79|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
It arose in part, no doubt, from the sentiment of love with which I was imbued; but chiefly from my conviction of the extreme sensibility of the singer.|2|79|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
It is beyond the reach of art to endow either air or recitative with more impassioned expression than was hers.|3|79|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"Her utterance of the romance in Otello–the tone with which she gave the words ""Sul mio sasso,"" in the Capuletti–is ringing in my memory yet."|4|79|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Her lower tones were absolutely miraculous.|5|79|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Her voice embraced three complete octaves, extending from the contralto D to the D upper soprano, and, though sufficiently powerful to have filled the San Carlos, executed, with the minutest precision, every difficulty of vocal composition-ascending and descending scales, cadences, or fiorituri.|6|79|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Ah!|0|80|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Al contento ond 'io son piena.|0|81|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Here, in imitation of Malibran, she modified the original phrase of Bellini, so as to let her voice descend to the tenor G, when, by a rapid transition, she struck the G above the treble stave, springing over an interval of two octaves.|0|82|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Upon rising from the piano after these miracles of vocal execution, she resumed her seat by my side; when I expressed to her, in terms of the deepest enthusiasm, my delight at her performance.|0|83|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Of my surprise I said nothing, and yet was I most unfeignedly surprised; for a certain feebleness, or rather a certain tremulous indecision of voice in ordinary conversation, had prepared me to anticipate that, in singing, she would not acquit herself with any remarkable ability.|1|83|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Our conversation was now long, earnest, uninterrupted, and totally unreserved.|0|84|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
She made me relate many of the earlier passages of my life, and listened with breathless attention to every word of the narrative.|1|84|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I concealed nothing–felt that I had a right to conceal nothing–from her confiding affection.|2|84|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Encouraged by her candor upon the delicate point of her age, I entered, with perfect frankness, not only into a detail of my many minor vices, but made full confession of those moral and even of those physical infirmities, the disclosure of which, in demanding so much higher a degree of courage, is so much surer an evidence of love.|3|84|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I touched upon my college indiscretions–upon my extravagances–upon my carousals- upon my debts–upon my flirtations.|4|84|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I even went so far as to speak of a slightly hectic cough with which, at one time, I had been troubled–of a chronic rheumatism–of a twinge of hereditary gout- and, in conclusion, of the disagreeable and inconvenient, but hitherto carefully concealed, weakness of my eyes.|5|84|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Upon this latter point,"" said Madame Lalande, laughingly, ""you have been surely injudicious in coming to confession; for, without the confession, I take it for granted that no one would have accused you of the crime."|0|85|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"By the by,"" she continued, ""have you any recollection-"" and here I fancied that a blush, even through the gloom of the apartment, became distinctly visible upon her cheek–""have you any recollection, mon cher ami of this little ocular assistant, which now depends from my neck""?"|1|85|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
As she spoke she twirled in her fingers the identical double eye-glass which had so overwhelmed me with confusion at the opera.|0|86|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Full well–alas!"|0|87|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"do I remember it,"" I exclaimed, pressing passionately the delicate hand which offered the glasses for my inspection."|1|87|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
They formed a complex and magnificent toy, richly chased and filigreed, and gleaming with jewels, which, even in the deficient light, I could not help perceiving were of high value.|2|87|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Eh bien!"|0|88|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"mon ami"" she resumed with a certain empressment of manner that rather surprised me–""Eh bien!"|1|88|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
mon ami, you have earnestly besought of me a favor which you have been pleased to denominate priceless.|2|88|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
You have demanded of me my hand upon the morrow.|3|88|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"Should I yield to your entreaties–and, I may add, to the pleadings of my own bosom–would I not be entitled to demand of you a very–a very little boon in return""?"|4|88|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Name it""!"|0|89|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I exclaimed with an energy that had nearly drawn upon us the observation of the company, and restrained by their presence alone from throwing myself impetuously at her feet.|1|89|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""Name it, my beloved, my Eugenie, my own!"|2|89|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
–name it!|3|89|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
–but, alas!|4|89|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"it is already yielded ere named""."|5|89|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""You shall conquer, then, mon ami,"" said she, ""for the sake of the Eugenie whom you love, this little weakness which you have at last confessed–this weakness more moral than physical–and which, let me assure you, is so unbecoming the nobility of your real nature–so inconsistent with the candor of your usual character–and which, if permitted further control, will assuredly involve you, sooner or later, in some very disagreeable scrape."|0|90|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
You shall conquer, for my sake, this affectation which leads you, as you yourself acknowledge, to the tacit or implied denial of your infirmity of vision.|1|90|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
For, this infirmity you virtually deny, in refusing to employ the customary means for its relief.|2|90|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
You will understand me to say, then, that I wish you to wear spectacles;–ah, hush!|3|90|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
–you have already consented to wear them, for my sake.|4|90|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
You shall accept the little toy which I now hold in my hand, and which, though admirable as an aid to vision, is really of no very immense value as a gem.|5|90|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
You perceive that, by a trifling modification thus–or thus–it can be adapted to the eyes in the form of spectacles, or worn in the waistcoat pocket as an eye-glass.|6|90|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"It is in the former mode, however, and habitually, that you have already consented to wear it for my sake""."|7|90|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
This request–must I confess it?|0|91|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
–confused me in no little degree.|1|91|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
But the condition with which it was coupled rendered hesitation, of course, a matter altogether out of the question.|2|91|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""It is done""!"|0|92|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I cried, with all the enthusiasm that I could muster at the moment.|1|92|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""It is done–it is most cheerfully agreed."|2|92|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I sacrifice every feeling for your sake.|3|92|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"To-night I wear this dear eye-glass, as an eye-glass, and upon my heart; but with the earliest dawn of that morning which gives me the pleasure of calling you wife, I will place it upon my–upon my nose,–and there wear it ever afterward, in the less romantic, and less fashionable, but certainly in the more serviceable, form which you desire""."|4|92|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Our conversation now turned upon the details of our arrangements for the morrow.|0|93|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Talbot, I learned from my betrothed, had just arrived in town.|1|93|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I was to see him at once, and procure a carriage.|2|93|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The soiree would scarcely break up before two; and by this hour the vehicle was to be at the door, when, in the confusion occasioned by the departure of the company, Madame L. could easily enter it unobserved.|3|93|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
We were then to call at the house of a clergyman who would be in waiting; there be married, drop Talbot, and proceed on a short tour to the East, leaving the fashionable world at home to make whatever comments upon the matter it thought best.|4|93|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Having planned all this, I immediately took leave, and went in search of Talbot, but, on the way, I could not refrain from stepping into a hotel, for the purpose of inspecting the miniature; and this I did by the powerful aid of the glasses.|0|94|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The countenance was a surpassingly beautiful one!|1|94|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Those large luminous eyes!|2|94|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
–that proud Grecian nose!|3|94|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
–those dark luxuriant curls!|4|94|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"–""Ah""!"|5|94|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"said I, exultingly to myself, ""this is indeed the speaking image of my beloved""!"|6|94|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"I turned the reverse, and discovered the words–""Eugenie Lalande–aged twenty-seven years and seven months""."|7|94|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I found Talbot at home, and proceeded at once to acquaint him with my good fortune.|0|95|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
He professed excessive astonishment, of course, but congratulated me most cordially, and proffered every assistance in his power.|1|95|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
In a word, we carried out our arrangement to the letter, and, at two in the morning, just ten minutes after the ceremony, I found myself in a close carriage with Madame Lalande–with Mrs. Simpson, I should say–and driving at a great rate out of town, in a direction Northeast by North, half-North.|2|95|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
It had been determined for us by Talbot, that, as we were to be up all night, we should make our first stop at C--, a village about twenty miles from the city, and there get an early breakfast and some repose, before proceeding upon our route.|0|96|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
At four precisely, therefore, the carriage drew up at the door of the principal inn.|1|96|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor

In the meantime we were shown into a small parlor, and sat down.|3|96|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
It was now nearly if not altogether daylight; and, as I gazed, enraptured, at the angel by my side, the singular idea came, all at once, into my head, that this was really the very first moment since my acquaintance with the celebrated loveliness of Madame Lalande, that I had enjoyed a near inspection of that loveliness by daylight at all.|0|97|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"""And now, mon ami,"" said she, taking my hand, and so interrupting this train of reflection, ""and now, mon cher ami, since we are indissolubly one–since I have yielded to your passionate entreaties, and performed my portion of our agreement–I presume you have not forgotten that you also have a little favor to bestow–a little promise which it is your intention to keep."|0|98|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor

To-night I wear this dear eye-glass as an eye-glass, and upon my heart; but with the earliest dawn of that morning which gives me the privilege of calling you wife, I will place it upon my–upon my nose,–and there wear it ever afterward, in the less romantic, and less fashionable, but certainly in the more serviceable, form which you desire.|9|98|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor

And here, having arranged the glasses in the ordinary form of spectacles, I applied them gingerly in their proper position; while Madame Simpson, adjusting her cap, and folding her arms, sat bolt upright in her chair, in a somewhat stiff and prim, and indeed, in a somewhat undignified position.|4|99|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor

and taking them quickly off, I wiped them carefully with a silk handkerchief, and adjusted them again.|3|100|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
But if, in the first instance, there had occurred something which occasioned me surprise, in the second, this surprise became elevated into astonishment; and this astonishment was profound–was extreme- indeed I may say it was horrific.|0|101|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
What, in the name of everything hideous, did this mean?|1|101|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor

I dashed the spectacles violently to the ground, and, leaping to my feet, stood erect in the middle of the floor, confronting Mrs. Simpson, with my arms set a-kimbo, and grinning and foaming, but, at the same time, utterly speechless with terror and with rage.|10|101|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Now I have already said that Madame Eugenie Lalande–that is to say, Simpson–spoke the English language but very little better than she wrote it, and for this reason she very properly never attempted to speak it upon ordinary occasions.|0|102|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
But rage will carry a lady to any extreme; and in the present care it carried Mrs. Simpson to the very extraordinary extreme of attempting to hold a conversation in a tongue that she did not altogether understand.|1|102|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor

Either the length or the nature of this speech, had the effect of working up Mrs. Simpson into a very extraordinary passion indeed; and as she made an end of it, with great labor, she lumped up from her chair like somebody bewitched, dropping upon the floor an entire universe of bustle as she lumped.|0|116|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Once upon her feet, she gnashed her gums, brandished her arms, rolled up her sleeves, shook her fist in my face, and concluded the performance by tearing the cap from her head, and with it an immense wig of the most valuable and beautiful black hair, the whole of which she dashed upon the ground with a yell, and there trammpled and danced a fandango upon it, in an absolute ecstasy and agony of rage.|1|116|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor

Madame Eugenie Lalande, quasi Simpson–formerly Moissart–was, in sober fact, my great, great, grandmother.|0|118|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
In her youth she had been beautiful, and even at eighty-two, retained the majestic height, the sculptural contour of head, the fine eyes and the Grecian nose of her girlhood.|1|118|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
By the aid of these, of pearl-powder, of rouge, of false hair, false teeth, and false tournure, as well as of the most skilful modistes of Paris, she contrived to hold a respectable footing among the beauties en peu passees of the French metropolis.|2|118|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
In this respect, indeed, she might have been regarded as little less than the equal of the celebrated Ninon De L'Enclos.|3|118|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
She was immensely wealthy, and being left, for the second time, a widow without children, she bethought herself of my existence in America, and for the purpose of making me her heir, paid a visit to the United States, in company with a distant and exceedingly lovely relative of her second husband's–a Madame Stephanie Lalande.|0|119|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
At the opera, my great, great, grandmother's attention was arrested by my notice; and, upon surveying me through her eye-glass, she was struck with a certain family resemblance to herself.|0|120|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Thus interested, and knowing that the heir she sought was actually in the city, she made inquiries of her party respecting me.|1|120|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The gentleman who attended her knew my person, and told her who I was.|2|120|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The information thus obtained induced her to renew her scrutiny; and this scrutiny it was which so emboldened me that I behaved in the absurd manner already detailed.|3|120|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
She returned my bow, however, under the impression that, by some odd accident, I had discovered her identity.|4|120|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"When, deceived by my weakness of vision, and the arts of the toilet, in respect to the age and charms of the strange lady, I demanded so enthusiastically of Talbot who she was, he concluded that I meant the younger beauty, as a matter of course, and so informed me, with perfect truth, that she was ""the celebrated widow, Madame Lalande""."|5|120|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
In the street, next morning, my great, great, grandmother encountered Talbot, an old Parisian acquaintance; and the conversation, very naturally turned upon myself.|0|121|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
My deficiencies of vision were then explained; for these were notorious, although I was entirely ignorant of their notoriety, and my good old relative discovered, much to her chagrin, that she had been deceived in supposing me aware of her identity, and that I had been merely making a fool of myself in making open love, in a theatre, to an old woman unknown.|1|121|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
By way of punishing me for this imprudence, she concocted with Talbot a plot.|2|121|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
He purposely kept out of my way to avoid giving me the introduction.|3|121|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"My street inquiries about ""the lovely widow, Madame Lalande,"" were supposed to refer to the younger lady, of course, and thus the conversation with the three gentlemen whom I encountered shortly after leaving Talbot's hotel will be easily explained, as also their allusion to Ninon De L'Enclos."|4|121|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I had no opportunity of seeing Madame Lalande closely during daylight; and, at her musical soiree, my silly weakness in refusing the aid of glasses effectually prevented me from making a discovery of her age.|5|121|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"When ""Madame Lalande"" was called upon to sing, the younger lady was intended; and it was she who arose to obey the call; my great, great, grandmother, to further the deception, arising at the same moment and accompanying her to the piano in the main drawing-room."|6|121|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Had I decided upon escorting her thither, it had been her design to suggest the propriety of my remaining where I was; but my own prudential views rendered this unnecessary.|7|121|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The songs which I so much admired, and which so confirmed my impression of the youth of my mistress, were executed by Madame Stephanie Lalande.|8|121|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The eyeglass was presented by way of adding a reproof to the hoax–a sting to the epigram of the deception.|9|121|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Its presentation afforded an opportunity for the lecture upon affectation with which I was so especially edified.|10|121|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
It is almost superfluous to add that the glasses of the instrument, as worn by the old lady, had been exchanged by her for a pair better adapted to my years.|11|121|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
The clergyman, who merely pretended to tie the fatal knot, was a boon companion of Talbot's, and no priest.|0|122|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"He was an excellent ""whip,"" however; and having doffed his cassock to put on a great-coat, he drove the hack which conveyed the ""happy couple"" out of town."|1|122|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Talbot took a seat at his side.|2|122|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
"The two scoundrels were thus ""in at the death,"" and through a half-open window of the back parlor of the inn, amused themselves in grinning at the denouement of the drama."|3|122|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
I believe I shall be forced to call them both out.|4|122|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
Nevertheless, I am not the husband of my great, great, grandmother; and this is a reflection which affords me infinite relief,–but I am the husband of Madame Lalande–of Madame Stephanie Lalande–with whom my good old relative, besides making me her sole heir when she dies–if she ever does–has been at the trouble of concocting me a match.|0|123|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
In conclusion: I am done forever with billets doux and am never to be met without SPECTACLES.|1|123|The Spectacles|March 27, 1844|Humor
DURING the fall of the year 1827, while residing near Charlottesville, Virginia, I casually made the acquaintance of Mr. Augustus Bedloe.|0|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
This young gentleman was remarkable in every respect, and excited in me a profound interest and curiosity.|1|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I found it impossible to comprehend him either in his moral or his physical relations.|2|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Of his family I could obtain no satisfactory account.|3|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Whence he came, I never ascertained.|4|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Even about his age–although I call him a young gentleman–there was something which perplexed me in no little degree.|5|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
He certainly seemed young–and he made a point of speaking about his youth–yet there were moments when I should have had little trouble in imagining him a hundred years of age.|6|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
But in no regard was he more peculiar than in his personal appearance.|7|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
He was singularly tall and thin.|8|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
He stooped much.|9|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
His limbs were exceedingly long and emaciated.|10|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
His forehead was broad and low.|11|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
His complexion was absolutely bloodless.|12|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
His mouth was large and flexible, and his teeth were more wildly uneven, although sound, than I had ever before seen teeth in a human head.|13|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
The expression of his smile, however, was by no means unpleasing, as might be supposed; but it had no variation whatever.|14|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
It was one of profound melancholy–of a phaseless and unceasing gloom.|15|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
His eyes were abnormally large, and round like those of a cat.|16|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
The pupils, too, upon any accession or diminution of light, underwent contraction or dilation, just such as is observed in the feline tribe.|17|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
In moments of excitement the orbs grew bright to a degree almost inconceivable; seeming to emit luminous rays, not of a reflected but of an intrinsic lustre, as does a candle or the sun; yet their ordinary condition was so totally vapid, filmy, and dull as to convey the idea of the eyes of a long-interred corpse.|18|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
These peculiarities of person appeared to cause him much annoyance, and he was continually alluding to them in a sort of half explanatory, half apologetic strain, which, when I first heard it, impressed me very painfully.|0|1|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I soon, however, grew accustomed to it, and my uneasiness wore off.|1|1|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
It seemed to be his design rather to insinuate than directly to assert that, physically, he had not always been what he was–that a long series of neuralgic attacks had reduced him from a condition of more than usual personal beauty, to that which I saw.|2|1|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
For many years past he had been attended by a physician, named Templeton–an old gentleman, perhaps seventy years of age–whom he had first encountered at Saratoga, and from whose attention, while there, he either received, or fancied that he received, great benefit.|3|1|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
The result was that Bedloe, who was wealthy, had made an arrangement with Dr. Templeton, by which the latter, in consideration of a liberal annual allowance, had consented to devote his time and medical experience exclusively to the care of the invalid.|4|1|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Doctor Templeton had been a traveller in his younger days, and at Paris had become a convert, in great measure, to the doctrines of Mesmer.|0|2|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
It was altogether by means of magnetic remedies that he had succeeded in alleviating the acute pains of his patient; and this success had very naturally inspired the latter with a certain degree of confidence in the opinions from which the remedies had been educed.|1|2|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
The Doctor, however, like all enthusiasts, had struggled hard to make a thorough convert of his pupil, and finally so far gained his point as to induce the sufferer to submit to numerous experiments.|2|2|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
By a frequent repetition of these, a result had arisen, which of late days has become so common as to attract little or no attention, but which, at the period of which I write, had very rarely been known in America.|3|2|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I mean to say, that between Doctor Templeton and Bedloe there had grown up, little by little, a very distinct and strongly marked rapport, or magnetic relation.|4|2|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I am not prepared to assert, however, that this rapport extended beyond the limits of the simple sleep-producing power, but this power itself had attained great intensity.|5|2|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
At the first attempt to induce the magnetic somnolency, the mesmerist entirely failed.|6|2|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
In the fifth or sixth he succeeded very partially, and after long continued effort.|7|2|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Only at the twelfth was the triumph complete.|8|2|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
After this the will of the patient succumbed rapidly to that of the physician, so that, when I first became acquainted with the two, sleep was brought about almost instantaneously by the mere volition of the operator, even when the invalid was unaware of his presence.|9|2|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
It is only now, in the year 1845, when similar miracles are witnessed daily by thousands, that I dare venture to record this apparent impossibility as a matter of serious fact.|10|2|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
The temperature of Bedloe was, in the highest degree sensitive, excitable, enthusiastic.|0|3|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
His imagination was singularly vigorous and creative; and no doubt it derived additional force from the habitual use of morphine, which he swallowed in great quantity, and without which he would have found it impossible to exist.|1|3|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
It was his practice to take a very large dose of it immediately after breakfast each morning–or, rather, immediately after a cup of strong coffee, for he ate nothing in the forenoon–and then set forth alone, or attended only by a dog, upon a long ramble among the chain of wild and dreary hills that lie westward and southward of Charlottesville, and are there dignified by the title of the Ragged Mountains.|2|3|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Upon a dim, warm, misty day, toward the close of November, and during the strange interregnum of the seasons which in America is termed the Indian Summer, Mr. Bedloe departed as usual for the hills.|0|4|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
The day passed, and still he did not return.|1|4|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
About eight o'clock at night, having become seriously alarmed at his protracted absence, we were about setting out in search of him, when he unexpectedly made his appearance, in health no worse than usual, and in rather more than ordinary spirits.|0|5|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
The account which he gave of his expedition, and of the events which had detained him, was a singular one indeed.|1|5|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""You will remember,"" said he, ""that it was about nine in the morning when I left Charlottesville."|0|6|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I bent my steps immediately to the mountains, and, about ten, entered a gorge which was entirely new to me.|1|6|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I followed the windings of this pass with much interest.|2|6|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
The scenery which presented itself on all sides, although scarcely entitled to be called grand, had about it an indescribable and to me a delicious aspect of dreary desolation.|3|6|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
The solitude seemed absolutely virgin.|4|6|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I could not help believing that the green sods and the gray rocks upon which I trod had been trodden never before by the foot of a human being.|5|6|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
So entirely secluded, and in fact inaccessible, except through a series of accidents, is the entrance of the ravine, that it is by no means impossible that I was indeed the first adventurer–the very first and sole adventurer who had ever penetrated its recesses.|6|6|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""The thick and peculiar mist, or smoke, which distinguishes the Indian Summer, and which now hung heavily over all objects, served, no doubt, to deepen the vague impressions which these objects created."|0|7|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
So dense was this pleasant fog that I could at no time see more than a dozen yards of the path before me.|1|7|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
This path was excessively sinuous, and as the sun could not be seen, I soon lost all idea of the direction in which I journeyed.|2|7|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
In the meantime the morphine had its customary effect–that of enduing all the external world with an intensity of interest.|3|7|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
In the quivering of a leaf–in the hue of a blade of grass–in the shape of a trefoil–in the humming of a bee–in the gleaming of a dew-drop–in the breathing of the wind–in the faint odors that came from the forest–there came a whole universe of suggestion–a gay and motley train of rhapsodical and immethodical thought.|4|7|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""Busied in this, I walked on for several hours, during which the mist deepened around me to so great an extent that at length I was reduced to an absolute groping of the way."|0|8|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
And now an indescribable uneasiness possessed me–a species of nervous hesitation and tremor.|1|8|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I feared to tread, lest I should be precipitated into some abyss.|2|8|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I remembered, too, strange stories told about these Ragged Hills, and of the uncouth and fierce races of men who tenanted their groves and caverns.|3|8|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
A thousand vague fancies oppressed and disconcerted me- fancies the more distressing because vague.|4|8|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Very suddenly my attention was arrested by the loud beating of a drum.|5|8|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""My amazement was, of course, extreme."|0|9|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
A drum in these hills was a thing unknown.|1|9|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I could not have been more surprised at the sound of the trump of the Archangel.|2|9|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
But a new and still more astounding source of interest and perplexity arose.|3|9|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
There came a wild rattling or jingling sound, as if of a bunch of large keys, and upon the instant a dusky-visaged and half-naked man rushed past me with a shriek.|4|9|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
He came so close to my person that I felt his hot breath upon my face.|5|9|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
He bore in one hand an instrument composed of an assemblage of steel rings, and shook them vigorously as he ran.|6|9|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Scarcely had he disappeared in the mist before, panting after him, with open mouth and glaring eyes, there darted a huge beast.|7|9|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I could not be mistaken in its character.|8|9|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
It was a hyena.|9|9|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""The sight of this monster rather relieved than heightened my terrors–for I now made sure that I dreamed, and endeavored to arouse myself to waking consciousness."|0|10|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I stepped boldly and briskly forward.|1|10|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I rubbed my eyes.|2|10|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I called aloud.|3|10|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I pinched my limbs.|4|10|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
A small spring of water presented itself to my view, and here, stooping, I bathed my hands and my head and neck.|5|10|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
This seemed to dissipate the equivocal sensations which had hitherto annoyed me.|6|10|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I arose, as I thought, a new man, and proceeded steadily and complacently on my unknown way.|7|10|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""At length, quite overcome by exertion, and by a certain oppressive closeness of the atmosphere, I seated myself beneath a tree."|0|11|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Presently there came a feeble gleam of sunshine, and the shadow of the leaves of the tree fell faintly but definitely upon the grass.|1|11|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
At this shadow I gazed wonderingly for many minutes.|2|11|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Its character stupefied me with astonishment.|3|11|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I looked upward.|4|11|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
The tree was a palm.|5|11|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""I now arose hurriedly, and in a state of fearful agitation–for the fancy that I dreamed would serve me no longer."|0|12|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I saw–I felt that I had perfect command of my senses–and these senses now brought to my soul a world of novel and singular sensation.|1|12|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
The heat became all at once intolerable.|2|12|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
A strange odor loaded the breeze.|3|12|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
A low, continuous murmur, like that arising from a full, but gently flowing river, came to my ears, intermingled with the peculiar hum of multitudinous human voices.|4|12|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""While I listened in an extremity of astonishment which I need not attempt to describe, a strong and brief gust of wind bore off the incumbent fog as if by the wand of an enchanter."|0|13|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""I found myself at the foot of a high mountain, and looking down into a vast plain, through which wound a majestic river."|0|14|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
On the margin of this river stood an Eastern-looking city, such as we read of in the Arabian Tales, but of a character even more singular than any there described.|1|14|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
From my position, which was far above the level of the town, I could perceive its every nook and corner, as if delineated on a map.|2|14|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
The streets seemed innumerable, and crossed each other irregularly in all directions, but were rather long winding alleys than streets, and absolutely swarmed with inhabitants.|3|14|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
The houses were wildly picturesque.|4|14|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
On every hand was a wilderness of balconies, of verandas, of minarets, of shrines, and fantastically carved oriels.|5|14|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Bazaars abounded; and in these were displayed rich wares in infinite variety and profusion–silks, muslins, the most dazzling cutlery, the most magnificent jewels and gems.|6|14|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Besides these things, were seen, on all sides, banners and palanquins, litters with stately dames close veiled, elephants gorgeously caparisoned, idols grotesquely hewn, drums, banners, and gongs, spears, silver and gilded maces.|7|14|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
And amid the crowd, and the clamor, and the general intricacy and confusion- amid the million of black and yellow men, turbaned and robed, and of flowing beard, there roamed a countless multitude of holy filleted bulls, while vast legions of the filthy but sacred ape clambered, chattering and shrieking, about the cornices of the mosques, or clung to the minarets and oriels.|8|14|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
From the swarming streets to the banks of the river, there descended innumerable flights of steps leading to bathing places, while the river itself seemed to force a passage with difficulty through the vast fleets of deeply–burthened ships that far and wide encountered its surface.|9|14|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Beyond the limits of the city arose, in frequent majestic groups, the palm and the cocoa, with other gigantic and weird trees of vast age, and here and there might be seen a field of rice, the thatched hut of a peasant, a tank, a stray temple, a gypsy camp, or a solitary graceful maiden taking her way, with a pitcher upon her head, to the banks of the magnificent river.|10|14|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""You will say now, of course, that I dreamed; but not so."|0|15|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
What I saw–what I heard–what I felt–what I thought–had about it nothing of the unmistakable idiosyncrasy of the dream.|1|15|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
All was rigorously self-consistent.|2|15|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
At first, doubting that I was really awake, I entered into a series of tests, which soon convinced me that I really was.|3|15|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Now, when one dreams, and, in the dream, suspects that he dreams, the suspicion never fails to confirm itself, and the sleeper is almost immediately aroused.|4|15|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Thus Novalis errs not in saying that 'we are near waking when we dream that we dream.|5|15|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"' Had the vision occurred to me as I describe it, without my suspecting it as a dream, then a dream it might absolutely have been, but, occurring as it did, and suspected and tested as it was, I am forced to class it among other phenomena""."|6|15|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""In this I am not sure that you are wrong,"" observed Dr. Templeton, ""but proceed."|0|16|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"You arose and descended into the city""."|1|16|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""I arose,"" continued Bedloe, regarding the Doctor with an air of profound astonishment ""I arose, as you say, and descended into the city."|0|17|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
On my way I fell in with an immense populace, crowding through every avenue, all in the same direction, and exhibiting in every action the wildest excitement.|1|17|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Very suddenly, and by some inconceivable impulse, I became intensely imbued with personal interest in what was going on.|2|17|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I seemed to feel that I had an important part to play, without exactly understanding what it was.|3|17|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Against the crowd which environed me, however, I experienced a deep sentiment of animosity.|4|17|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I shrank from amid them, and, swiftly, by a circuitous path, reached and entered the city.|5|17|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Here all was the wildest tumult and contention.|6|17|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
A small party of men, clad in garments half-Indian, half-European, and officered by gentlemen in a uniform partly British, were engaged, at great odds, with the swarming rabble of the alleys.|7|17|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I joined the weaker party, arming myself with the weapons of a fAllan officer, and fighting I knew not whom with the nervous ferocity of despair.|8|17|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
We were soon overpowered by numbers, and driven to seek refuge in a species of kiosk.|9|17|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Here we barricaded ourselves, and, for the present were secure.|10|17|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
From a loop-hole near the summit of the kiosk, I perceived a vast crowd, in furious agitation, surrounding and assaulting a gay palace that overhung the river.|11|17|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Presently, from an upper window of this place, there descended an effeminate-looking person, by means of a string made of the turbans of his attendants.|12|17|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
A boat was at hand, in which he escaped to the opposite bank of the river.|13|17|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""And now a new object took possession of my soul."|0|18|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I spoke a few hurried but energetic words to my companions, and, having succeeded in gaining over a few of them to my purpose made a frantic sally from the kiosk.|1|18|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
We rushed amid the crowd that surrounded it.|2|18|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
They retreated, at first, before us.|3|18|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
They rallied, fought madly, and retreated again.|4|18|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
In the mean time we were borne far from the kiosk, and became bewildered and entangled among the narrow streets of tall, overhanging houses, into the recesses of which the sun had never been able to shine.|5|18|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
The rabble pressed impetuously upon us, harrassing us with their spears, and overwhelming us with flights of arrows.|6|18|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
These latter were very remarkable, and resembled in some respects the writhing creese of the Malay.|7|18|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
They were made to imitate the body of a creeping serpent, and were long and black, with a poisoned barb.|8|18|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
One of them struck me upon the right temple.|9|18|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I reeled and fell.|10|18|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
An instantaneous and dreadful sickness seized me.|11|18|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"I struggled–I gasped–I died""."|12|18|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""You will hardly persist now,"" said I smiling, ""that the whole of your adventure was not a dream."|0|19|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"You are not prepared to maintain that you are dead""?"|1|19|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
When I said these words, I of course expected some lively sally from Bedloe in reply, but, to my astonishment, he hesitated, trembled, became fearfully pallid, and remained silent.|0|20|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I looked toward Templeton.|1|20|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
He sat erect and rigid in his chair–his teeth chattered, and his eyes were starting from their sockets.|2|20|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""Proceed""!"|3|20|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
he at length said hoarsely to Bedloe.|4|20|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""For many minutes,"" continued the latter, ""my sole sentiment–my sole feeling–was that of darkness and nonentity, with the consciousness of death."|0|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
At length there seemed to pass a violent and sudden shock through my soul, as if of electricity.|1|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
With it came the sense of elasticity and of light.|2|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
This latter I felt–not saw.|3|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
In an instant I seemed to rise from the ground.|4|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
But I had no bodily, no visible, audible, or palpable presence.|5|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
The crowd had departed.|6|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
The tumult had ceased.|7|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
The city was in comparative repose.|8|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Beneath me lay my corpse, with the arrow in my temple, the whole head greatly swollen and disfigured.|9|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
But all these things I felt–not saw.|10|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I took interest in nothing.|11|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Even the corpse seemed a matter in which I had no concern.|12|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Volition I had none, but appeared to be impelled into motion, and flitted buoyantly out of the city, retracing the circuitous path by which I had entered it.|13|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
When I had attained that point of the ravine in the mountains at which I had encountered the hyena, I again experienced a shock as of a galvanic battery, the sense of weight, of volition, of substance, returned.|14|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"I became my original self, and bent my steps eagerly homeward–but the past had not lost the vividness of the real–and not now, even for an instant, can I compel my understanding to regard it as a dream""."|15|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""Nor was it,"" said Templeton, with an air of deep solemnity, ""yet it would be difficult to say how otherwise it should be termed."|0|22|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Let us suppose only, that the soul of the man of to-day is upon the verge of some stupendous psychal discoveries.|1|22|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Let us content ourselves with this supposition.|2|22|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
For the rest I have some explanation to make.|3|22|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"Here is a watercolor drawing, which I should have shown you before, but which an unaccountable sentiment of horror has hitherto prevented me from showing""."|4|22|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
We looked at the picture which he presented.|0|23|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I saw nothing in it of an extraordinary character, but its effect upon Bedloe was prodigious.|1|23|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
He nearly fainted as he gazed.|2|23|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
And yet it was but a miniature portrait–a miraculously accurate one, to be sure–of his own very remarkable features.|3|23|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
At least this was my thought as I regarded it.|4|23|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""You will perceive,"" said Templeton, ""the date of this picture–it is here, scarcely visible, in this corner–1780."|0|24|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
In this year was the portrait taken.|1|24|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
It is the likeness of a dead friend–a Mr. Oldeb–to whom I became much attached at Calcutta, during the administration of Warren Hastings.|2|24|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I was then only twenty years old.|3|24|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
When I first saw you, Mr. Bedloe, at Saratoga, it was the miraculous similarity which existed between yourself and the painting which induced me to accost you, to seek your friendship, and to bring about those arrangements which resulted in my becoming your constant companion.|4|24|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
In accomplishing this point, I was urged partly, and perhaps principally, by a regretful memory of the deceased, but also, in part, by an uneasy, and not altogether horrorless curiosity respecting yourself.|5|24|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""In your detail of the vision which presented itself to you amid the hills, you have described, with the minutest accuracy, the Indian city of Benares, upon the Holy River."|0|25|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
The riots, the combat, the massacre, were the actual events of the insurrection of Cheyte Sing, which took place in 1780, when Hastings was put in imminent peril of his life.|1|25|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
The man escaping by the string of turbans was Cheyte Sing himself.|2|25|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
The party in the kiosk were sepoys and British officers, headed by Hastings.|3|25|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Of this party I was one, and did all I could to prevent the rash and fatal sally of the officer who fell, in the crowded alleys, by the poisoned arrow of a Bengalee.|4|25|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
That officer was my dearest friend.|5|25|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
It was Oldeb.|6|25|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"You will perceive by these manuscripts,"" (here the speaker produced a note-book in which several pages appeared to have been freshly written,) ""that at the very period in which you fancied these things amid the hills, I was engaged in detailing them upon paper here at home""."|7|25|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""We have the painful duty of announcing the death of Mr. Augustus Bedlo, a gentleman whose amiable manners and many virtues have long endeared him to the citizens of Charlottesville."|0|27|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""Mr. B., for some years past, has been subject to neuralgia, which has often threatened to terminate fatally; but this can be regarded only as the mediate cause of his decease."|0|28|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
The proximate cause was one of especial singularity.|1|28|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
In an excursion to the Ragged Mountains, a few days since, a slight cold and fever were contracted, attended with great determination of blood to the head.|2|28|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
To relieve this, Dr. Templeton resorted to topical bleeding.|3|28|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Leeches were applied to the temples.|4|28|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
In a fearfully brief period the patient died, when it appeared that in the jar containing the leeches, had been introduced, by accident, one of the venomous vermicular sangsues which are now and then found in the neighboring ponds.|5|28|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
This creature fastened itself upon a small artery in the right temple.|6|28|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
Its close resemblance to the medicinal leech caused the mistake to be overlooked until too late.|7|28|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""N."|0|29|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"B. The poisonous sangsue of Charlottesville may always be distinguished from the medicinal leech by its blackness, and especially by its writhing or vermicular motions, which very nearly resemble those of a snake""."|1|29|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
I was speaking with the editor of the paper in question, upon the topic of this remarkable accident, when it occurred to me to ask how it happened that the name of the deceased had been given as Bedlo.|0|30|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""I presume,"" I said, ""you have authority for this spelling, but I have always supposed the name to be written with an e at the end""."|0|31|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"""Authority?"|0|32|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure
"–no,"" he replied."|1|32|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|April 1844|Science fiction, Adventure

THERE are certain themes of which the interest is all-absorbing, but which are too entirely horrible for the purposes of legitimate fiction.|0|0|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
These the mere romanticist must eschew, if he do not wish to offend or to disgust.|1|0|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
They are with propriety handled only when the severity and majesty of Truth sanctify and sustain them.|2|0|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
"We thrill, for example, with the most intense of ""pleasurable pain"" over the accounts of the Passage of the Beresina, of the Earthquake at Lisbon, of the Plague at London, of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, or of the stifling of the hundred and twenty-three prisoners in the Black Hole at Calcutta."|3|0|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
But in these accounts it is the fact–it is the reality–it is the history which excites.|4|0|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
As inventions, we should regard them with simple abhorrence.|5|0|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I have mentioned some few of the more prominent and august calamities on record; but in these it is the extent, not less than the character of the calamity, which so vividly impresses the fancy.|0|1|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I need not remind the reader that, from the long and weird catalogue of human miseries, I might have selected many individual instances more replete with essential suffering than any of these vast generalities of disaster.|1|1|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
The true wretchedness, indeed–the ultimate woe–is particular, not diffuse.|2|1|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
That the ghastly extremes of agony are endured by man the unit, and never by man the mass–for this let us thank a merciful God!|3|1|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
To be buried while alive is, beyond question, the most terrific of these extremes which has ever fAllan to the lot of mere mortality.|0|2|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
That it has frequently, very frequently, so fAllan will scarcely be denied by those who think.|1|2|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror

Apart, however, from the inevitable conclusion, a priori that such causes must produce such effects–that the well-known occurrence of such cases of suspended animation must naturally give rise, now and then, to premature interments–apart from this consideration, we have the direct testimony of medical and ordinary experience to prove that a vast number of such interments have actually taken place.|0|3|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I might refer at once, if necessary to a hundred well authenticated instances.|1|3|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror

As its portals swung outwardly back, some white-apparelled object fell rattling within his arms.|3|4|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
It was the skeleton of his wife in her yet unmoulded shroud.|4|4|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
A careful investigation rendered it evident that she had revived within two days after her entombment; that her struggles within the coffin had caused it to fall from a ledge, or shelf to the floor, where it was so broken as to permit her escape.|0|5|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
A lamp which had been accidentally left, full of oil, within the tomb, was found empty; it might have been exhausted, however, by evaporation.|1|5|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
On the uttermost of the steps which led down into the dread chamber was a large fragment of the coffin, with which, it seemed, that she had endeavored to arrest attention by striking the iron door.|2|5|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
While thus occupied, she probably swooned, or possibly died, through sheer terror; and, in failing, her shroud became entangled in some iron- work which projected interiorly.|3|5|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Thus she remained, and thus she rotted, erect.|4|5|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror

Among her numerous suitors was Julien Bossuet, a poor litterateur, or journalist of Paris.|2|6|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
His talents and general amiability had recommended him to the notice of the heiress, by whom he seems to have been truly beloved; but her pride of birth decided her, finally, to reject him, and to wed a Monsieur Renelle, a banker and a diplomatist of some eminence.|3|6|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
After marriage, however, this gentleman neglected, and, perhaps, even more positively ill-treated her.|4|6|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror

He reaches the grave.|8|6|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
At midnight he unearths the coffin, opens it, and is in the act of detaching the hair, when he is arrested by the unclosing of the beloved eyes.|9|6|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
In fact, the lady had been buried alive.|10|6|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Vitality had not altogether departed, and she was aroused by the caresses of her lover from the lethargy which had been mistaken for death.|11|6|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
He bore her frantically to his lodgings in the village.|12|6|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror

She recognized her preserver.|15|6|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
She remained with him until, by slow degrees, she fully recovered her original health.|16|6|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Her woman's heart was not adamant, and this last lesson of love sufficed to soften it.|17|6|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
She bestowed it upon Bossuet.|18|6|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
She returned no more to her husband, but, concealing from him her resurrection, fled with her lover to America.|19|6|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Twenty years afterward, the two returned to France, in the persuasion that time had so greatly altered the lady's appearance that her friends would be unable to recognize her.|20|6|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
They were mistaken, however, for, at the first meeting, Monsieur Renelle did actually recognize and make claim to his wife.|21|6|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
This claim she resisted, and a judicial tribunal sustained her in her resistance, deciding that the peculiar circumstances, with the long lapse of years, had extinguished, not only equitably, but legally, the authority of the husband.|22|6|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
"The ""Chirurgical Journal"" of Leipsic–a periodical of high authority and merit, which some American bookseller would do well to translate and republish, records in a late number a very distressing event of the character in question."|0|7|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
An officer of artillery, a man of gigantic stature and of robust health, being thrown from an unmanageable horse, received a very severe contusion upon the head, which rendered him insensible at once; the skull was slightly fractured, but no immediate danger was apprehended.|0|8|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Trepanning was accomplished successfully.|1|8|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
He was bled, and many other of the ordinary means of relief were adopted.|2|8|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Gradually, however, he fell into a more and more hopeless state of stupor, and, finally, it was thought that he died.|3|8|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
The weather was warm, and he was buried with indecent haste in one of the public cemeteries.|0|9|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
His funeral took place on Thursday.|1|9|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
On the Sunday following, the grounds of the cemetery were, as usual, much thronged with visiters, and about noon an intense excitement was created by the declaration of a peasant that, while sitting upon the grave of the officer, he had distinctly felt a commotion of the earth, as if occasioned by some one struggling beneath.|2|9|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
At first little attention was paid to the man's asseveration; but his evident terror, and the dogged obstinacy with which he persisted in his story, had at length their natural effect upon the crowd.|3|9|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Spades were hurriedly procured, and the grave, which was shamefully shallow, was in a few minutes so far thrown open that the head of its occupant appeared.|4|9|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
He was then seemingly dead; but he sat nearly erect within his coffin, the lid of which, in his furious struggles, he had partially uplifted.|5|9|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
He was forthwith conveyed to the nearest hospital, and there pronounced to be still living, although in an asphytic condition.|0|10|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
After some hours he revived, recognized individuals of his acquaintance, and, in broken sentences spoke of his agonies in the grave.|1|10|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
From what he related, it was clear that he must have been conscious of life for more than an hour, while inhumed, before lapsing into insensibility.|0|11|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
The grave was carelessly and loosely filled with an exceedingly porous soil; and thus some air was necessarily admitted.|1|11|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
He heard the footsteps of the crowd overhead, and endeavored to make himself heard in turn.|2|11|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
It was the tumult within the grounds of the cemetery, he said, which appeared to awaken him from a deep sleep, but no sooner was he awake than he became fully aware of the awful horrors of his position.|3|11|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
This patient, it is recorded, was doing well and seemed to be in a fair way of ultimate recovery, but fell a victim to the quackeries of medical experiment.|0|12|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
The galvanic battery was applied, and he suddenly expired in one of those ecstatic paroxysms which, occasionally, it superinduces.|1|12|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
The mention of the galvanic battery, nevertheless, recalls to my memory a well known and very extraordinary case in point, where its action proved the means of restoring to animation a young attorney of London, who had been interred for two days.|0|13|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
The patient, Mr. Edward Stapleton, had died, apparently of typhus fever, accompanied with some anomalous symptoms which had excited the curiosity of his medical attendants.|0|14|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Upon his seeming decease, his friends were requested to sanction a post-mortem examination, but declined to permit it.|1|14|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
As often happens, when such refusals are made, the practitioners resolved to disinter the body and dissect it at leisure, in private.|2|14|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Arrangements were easily effected with some of the numerous corps of body-snatchers, with which London abounds; and, upon the third night after the funeral, the supposed corpse was unearthed from a grave eight feet deep, and deposited in the opening chamber of one of the private hospitals.|3|14|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
An incision of some extent had been actually made in the abdomen, when the fresh and undecayed appearance of the subject suggested an application of the battery.|0|15|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
One experiment succeeded another, and the customary effects supervened, with nothing to characterize them in any respect, except, upon one or two occasions, a more than ordinary degree of life-likeness in the convulsive action.|1|15|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
It grew late.|0|16|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
The day was about to dawn; and it was thought expedient, at length, to proceed at once to the dissection.|1|16|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
A student, however, was especially desirous of testing a theory of his own, and insisted upon applying the battery to one of the pectoral muscles.|2|16|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
A rough gash was made, and a wire hastily brought in contact, when the patient, with a hurried but quite unconvulsive movement, arose from the table, stepped into the middle of the floor, gazed about him uneasily for a few seconds, and then–spoke.|3|16|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
What he said was unintelligible, but words were uttered; the syllabification was distinct.|4|16|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Having spoken, he fell heavily to the floor.|5|16|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
For some moments all were paralyzed with awe–but the urgency of the case soon restored them their presence of mind.|0|17|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
It was seen that Mr. Stapleton was alive, although in a swoon.|1|17|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Upon exhibition of ether he revived and was rapidly restored to health, and to the society of his friends–from whom, however, all knowledge of his resuscitation was withheld, until a relapse was no longer to be apprehended.|2|17|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Their wonder–their rapturous astonishment–may be conceived.|3|17|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
The most thrilling peculiarity of this incident, nevertheless, is involved in what Mr. S. himself asserts.|0|18|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
He declares that at no period was he altogether insensible–that, dully and confusedly, he was aware of everything which happened to him, from the moment in which he was pronounced dead by his physicians, to that in which he fell swooning to the floor of the hospital.|1|18|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
"""I am alive,"" were the uncomprehended words which, upon recognizing the locality of the dissecting-room, he had endeavored, in his extremity, to utter."|2|18|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
It were an easy matter to multiply such histories as these–but I forbear–for, indeed, we have no need of such to establish the fact that premature interments occur.|0|19|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
When we reflect how very rarely, from the nature of the case, we have it in our power to detect them, we must admit that they may frequently occur without our cognizance.|1|19|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Scarcely, in truth, is a graveyard ever encroached upon, for any purpose, to any great extent, that skeletons are not found in postures which suggest the most fearful of suspicions.|2|19|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Fearful indeed the suspicion–but more fearful the doom!|0|20|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
It may be asserted, without hesitation, that no event is so terribly well adapted to inspire the supremeness of bodily and of mental distress, as is burial before death.|1|20|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
The unendurable oppression of the lungs- the stifling fumes from the damp earth–the clinging to the death garments–the rigid embrace of the narrow house–the blackness of the absolute Night–the silence like a sea that overwhelms–the unseen but palpable presence of the Conqueror Worm–these things, with the thoughts of the air and grass above, with memory of dear friends who would fly to save us if but informed of our fate, and with consciousness that of this fate they can never be informed–that our hopeless portion is that of the really dead–these considerations, I say, carry into the heart, which still palpitates, a degree of appalling and intolerable horror from which the most daring imagination must recoil.|2|20|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
We know of nothing so agonizing upon Earth- we can dream of nothing half so hideous in the realms of the nethermost Hell.|3|20|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
And thus all narratives upon this topic have an interest profound; an interest, nevertheless, which, through the sacred awe of the topic itself, very properly and very peculiarly depends upon our conviction of the truth of the matter narrated.|4|20|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
What I have now to tell is of my own actual knowledge–of my own positive and personal experience.|5|20|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
For several years I had been subject to attacks of the singular disorder which physicians have agreed to term catalepsy, in default of a more definitive title.|0|21|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Although both the immediate and the predisposing causes, and even the actual diagnosis, of this disease are still mysterious, its obvious and apparent character is sufficiently well understood.|1|21|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Its variations seem to be chiefly of degree.|2|21|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Sometimes the patient lies, for a day only, or even for a shorter period, in a species of exaggerated lethargy.|3|21|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
He is senseless and externally motionless; but the pulsation of the heart is still faintly perceptible; some traces of warmth remain; a slight color lingers within the centre of the cheek; and, upon application of a mirror to the lips, we can detect a torpid, unequal, and vacillating action of the lungs.|4|21|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Then again the duration of the trance is for weeks–even for months; while the closest scrutiny, and the most rigorous medical tests, fail to establish any material distinction between the state of the sufferer and what we conceive of absolute death.|5|21|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Very usually he is saved from premature interment solely by the knowledge of his friends that he has been previously subject to catalepsy, by the consequent suspicion excited, and, above all, by the non-appearance of decay.|6|21|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
The advances of the malady are, luckily, gradual.|7|21|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
The first manifestations, although marked, are unequivocal.|8|21|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
The fits grow successively more and more distinctive, and endure each for a longer term than the preceding.|9|21|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
In this lies the principal security from inhumation.|10|21|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
The unfortunate whose first attack should be of the extreme character which is occasionally seen, would almost inevitably be consigned alive to the tomb.|11|21|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
My own case differed in no important particular from those mentioned in medical books.|0|22|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Sometimes, without any apparent cause, I sank, little by little, into a condition of hemi-syncope, or half swoon; and, in this condition, without pain, without ability to stir, or, strictly speaking, to think, but with a dull lethargic consciousness of life and of the presence of those who surrounded my bed, I remained, until the crisis of the disease restored me, suddenly, to perfect sensation.|1|22|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
At other times I was quickly and impetuously smitten.|2|22|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I grew sick, and numb, and chilly, and dizzy, and so fell prostrate at once.|3|22|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Then, for weeks, all was void, and black, and silent, and Nothing became the universe.|4|22|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Total annihilation could be no more.|5|22|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
From these latter attacks I awoke, however, with a gradation slow in proportion to the suddenness of the seizure.|6|22|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Just as the day dawns to the friendless and houseless beggar who roams the streets throughout the long desolate winter night–just so tardily- just so wearily–just so cheerily came back the light of the Soul to me.|7|22|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Apart from the tendency to trance, however, my general health appeared to be good; nor could I perceive that it was at all affected by the one prevalent malady–unless, indeed, an idiosyncrasy in my ordinary sleep may be looked upon as superinduced.|0|23|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Upon awaking from slumber, I could never gain, at once, thorough possession of my senses, and always remained, for many minutes, in much bewilderment and perplexity;–the mental faculties in general, but the memory in especial, being in a condition of absolute abeyance.|1|23|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
In all that I endured there was no physical suffering but of moral distress an infinitude.|0|24|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
"My fancy grew charnel, I talked ""of worms, of tombs, and epitaphs""."|1|24|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I was lost in reveries of death, and the idea of premature burial held continual possession of my brain.|2|24|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
The ghastly Danger to which I was subjected haunted me day and night.|3|24|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
In the former, the torture of meditation was excessive–in the latter, supreme.|4|24|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
When the grim Darkness overspread the Earth, then, with every horror of thought, I shook–shook as the quivering plumes upon the hearse.|5|24|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
When Nature could endure wakefulness no longer, it was with a struggle that I consented to sleep–for I shuddered to reflect that, upon awaking, I might find myself the tenant of a grave.|6|24|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
And when, finally, I sank into slumber, it was only to rush at once into a world of phantasms, above which, with vast, sable, overshadowing wing, hovered, predominant, the one sepulchral Idea.|7|24|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
From the innumerable images of gloom which thus oppressed me in dreams, I select for record but a solitary vision.|0|25|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Methought I was immersed in a cataleptic trance of more than usual duration and profundity.|1|25|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
"Suddenly there came an icy hand upon my forehead, and an impatient, gibbering voice whispered the word ""Arise""!"|2|25|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
within my ear.|3|25|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I sat erect.|0|26|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
The darkness was total.|1|26|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I could not see the figure of him who had aroused me.|2|26|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I could call to mind neither the period at which I had fAllan into the trance, nor the locality in which I then lay.|3|26|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
"""Arise!"|0|27|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
"did I not bid thee arise""?"|1|27|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
"""And who,"" I demanded, ""art thou""?"|0|28|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
"""I have no name in the regions which I inhabit,"" replied the voice, mournfully; ""I was mortal, but am fiend."|0|29|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I was merciless, but am pitiful.|1|29|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Thou dost feel that I shudder.|2|29|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
–My teeth chatter as I speak, yet it is not with the chilliness of the night–of the night without end.|3|29|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
But this hideousness is insufferable.|4|29|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
How canst thou tranquilly sleep?|5|29|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I cannot rest for the cry of these great agonies.|6|29|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
These sights are more than I can bear.|7|29|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Get thee up!|8|29|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Come with me into the outer Night, and let me unfold to thee the graves.|9|29|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Is not this a spectacle of woe?|10|29|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
"–Behold""!"|11|29|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I looked; and the unseen figure, which still grasped me by the wrist, had caused to be thrown open the graves of all mankind, and from each issued the faint phosphoric radiance of decay, so that I could see into the innermost recesses, and there view the shrouded bodies in their sad and solemn slumbers with the worm.|0|30|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
But alas!|1|30|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
the real sleepers were fewer, by many millions, than those who slumbered not at all; and there was a feeble struggling; and there was a general sad unrest; and from out the depths of the countless pits there came a melancholy rustling from the garments of the buried.|2|30|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
And of those who seemed tranquilly to repose, I saw that a vast number had changed, in a greater or less degree, the rigid and uneasy position in which they had originally been entombed.|3|30|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
"""Is it not–oh!"|0|31|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
"is it not a pitiful sight""?"|1|31|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
"–but, before I could find words to reply, the figure had ceased to grasp my wrist, the phosphoric lights expired, and the graves were closed with a sudden violence, while from out them arose a tumult of despairing cries, saying again: ""Is it not–O, God, is it not a very pitiful sight""?"|2|31|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Phantasies such as these, presenting themselves at night, extended their terrific influence far into my waking hours.|0|32|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
My nerves became thoroughly unstrung, and I fell a prey to perpetual horror.|1|32|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I hesitated to ride, or to walk, or to indulge in any exercise that would carry me from home.|2|32|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
In fact, I no longer dared trust myself out of the immediate presence of those who were aware of my proneness to catalepsy, lest, falling into one of my usual fits, I should be buried before my real condition could be ascertained.|3|32|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I doubted the care, the fidelity of my dearest friends.|4|32|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I dreaded that, in some trance of more than customary duration, they might be prevailed upon to regard me as irrecoverable.|5|32|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I even went so far as to fear that, as I occasioned much trouble, they might be glad to consider any very protracted attack as sufficient excuse for getting rid of me altogether.|6|32|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
It was in vain they endeavored to reassure me by the most solemn promises.|7|32|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I exacted the most sacred oaths, that under no circumstances they would bury me until decomposition had so materially advanced as to render farther preservation impossible.|8|32|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
And, even then, my mortal terrors would listen to no reason–would accept no consolation.|9|32|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I entered into a series of elaborate precautions.|10|32|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Among other things, I had the family vault so remodelled as to admit of being readily opened from within.|11|32|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
The slightest pressure upon a long lever that extended far into the tomb would cause the iron portal to fly back.|12|32|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
There were arrangements also for the free admission of air and light, and convenient receptacles for food and water, within immediate reach of the coffin intended for my reception.|13|32|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
This coffin was warmly and softly padded, and was provided with a lid, fashioned upon the principle of the vault-door, with the addition of springs so contrived that the feeblest movement of the body would be sufficient to set it at liberty.|14|32|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Besides all this, there was suspended from the roof of the tomb, a large bell, the rope of which, it was designed, should extend through a hole in the coffin, and so be fastened to one of the hands of the corpse.|15|32|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
But, alas?|16|32|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
what avails the vigilance against the Destiny of man?|17|32|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Not even these well-contrived securities sufficed to save from the uttermost agonies of living inhumation, a wretch to these agonies foredoomed!|18|32|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
There arrived an epoch–as often before there had arrived–in which I found myself emerging from total unconsciousness into the first feeble and indefinite sense of existence.|0|33|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Slowly–with a tortoise gradation–approached the faint gray dawn of the psychal day.|1|33|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
A torpid uneasiness.|2|33|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
An apathetic endurance of dull pain.|3|33|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
No care- no hope–no effort.|4|33|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Then, after a long interval, a ringing in the ears; then, after a lapse still longer, a prickling or tingling sensation in the extremities; then a seemingly eternal period of pleasurable quiescence, during which the awakening feelings are struggling into thought; then a brief re-sinking into non-entity; then a sudden recovery.|5|33|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
At length the slight quivering of an eyelid, and immediately thereupon, an electric shock of a terror, deadly and indefinite, which sends the blood in torrents from the temples to the heart.|6|33|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
And now the first positive effort to think.|7|33|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
And now the first endeavor to remember.|8|33|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
And now a partial and evanescent success.|9|33|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
And now the memory has so far regained its dominion, that, in some measure, I am cognizant of my state.|10|33|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I feel that I am not awaking from ordinary sleep.|11|33|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I recollect that I have been subject to catalepsy.|12|33|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
And now, at last, as if by the rush of an ocean, my shuddering spirit is overwhelmed by the one grim Danger–by the one spectral and ever-prevalent idea.|13|33|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
For some minutes after this fancy possessed me, I remained without motion.|0|34|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
And why?|1|34|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I could not summon courage to move.|2|34|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I dared not make the effort which was to satisfy me of my fate–and yet there was something at my heart which whispered me it was sure.|3|34|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Despair- such as no other species of wretchedness ever calls into being- despair alone urged me, after long irresolution, to uplift the heavy lids of my eyes.|4|34|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I uplifted them.|5|34|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
It was dark–all dark.|6|34|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I knew that the fit was over.|7|34|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I knew that the crisis of my disorder had long passed.|8|34|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I knew that I had now fully recovered the use of my visual faculties–and yet it was dark–all dark–the intense and utter raylessness of the Night that endureth for evermore.|9|34|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I endeavored to shriek-, and my lips and my parched tongue moved convulsively together in the attempt–but no voice issued from the cavernous lungs, which oppressed as if by the weight of some incumbent mountain, gasped and palpitated, with the heart, at every elaborate and struggling inspiration.|0|35|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
The movement of the jaws, in this effort to cry aloud, showed me that they were bound up, as is usual with the dead.|0|36|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I felt, too, that I lay upon some hard substance, and by something similar my sides were, also, closely compressed.|1|36|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
So far, I had not ventured to stir any of my limbs–but now I violently threw up my arms, which had been lying at length, with the wrists crossed.|2|36|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
They struck a solid wooden substance, which extended above my person at an elevation of not more than six inches from my face.|3|36|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I could no longer doubt that I reposed within a coffin at last.|4|36|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
And now, amid all my infinite miseries, came sweetly the cherub Hope–for I thought of my precautions.|0|37|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I writhed, and made spasmodic exertions to force open the lid: it would not move.|1|37|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I felt my wrists for the bell-rope: it was not to be found.|2|37|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
And now the Comforter fled for ever, and a still sterner Despair reigned triumphant; for I could not help perceiving the absence of the paddings which I had so carefully prepared–and then, too, there came suddenly to my nostrils the strong peculiar odor of moist earth.|3|37|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
The conclusion was irresistible.|4|37|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I was not within the vault.|5|37|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I had fAllan into a trance while absent from home-while among strangers–when, or how, I could not remember–and it was they who had buried me as a dog–nailed up in some common coffin–and thrust deep, deep, and for ever, into some ordinary and nameless grave.|6|37|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
As this awful conviction forced itself, thus, into the innermost chambers of my soul, I once again struggled to cry aloud.|0|38|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
And in this second endeavor I succeeded.|1|38|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
A long, wild, and continuous shriek, or yell of agony, resounded through the realms of the subterranean Night.|2|38|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
"""Hillo!"|0|39|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
"hillo, there""!"|1|39|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
said a gruff voice, in reply.|2|39|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
"""What the devil's the matter now""!"|0|40|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
said a second.|1|40|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
"""Get out o' that""!"|0|41|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
said a third.|1|41|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
"""What do you mean by yowling in that ere kind of style, like a cattymount""?"|0|42|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
said a fourth; and hereupon I was seized and shaken without ceremony, for several minutes, by a junto of very rough-looking individuals.|1|42|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
They did not arouse me from my slumber–for I was wide awake when I screamed–but they restored me to the full possession of my memory.|2|42|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
This adventure occurred near Richmond, in Virginia.|0|43|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Accompanied by a friend, I had proceeded, upon a gunning expedition, some miles down the banks of the James River.|1|43|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Night approached, and we were overtaken by a storm.|2|43|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
The cabin of a small sloop lying at anchor in the stream, and laden with garden mould, afforded us the only available shelter.|3|43|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
We made the best of it, and passed the night on board.|4|43|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I slept in one of the only two berths in the vessel–and the berths of a sloop of sixty or twenty tons need scarcely be described.|5|43|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
That which I occupied had no bedding of any kind.|6|43|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Its extreme width was eighteen inches.|7|43|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
The distance of its bottom from the deck overhead was precisely the same.|8|43|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I found it a matter of exceeding difficulty to squeeze myself in.|9|43|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Nevertheless, I slept soundly, and the whole of my vision–for it was no dream, and no nightmare–arose naturally from the circumstances of my position–from my ordinary bias of thought–and from the difficulty, to which I have alluded, of collecting my senses, and especially of regaining my memory, for a long time after awaking from slumber.|10|43|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
The men who shook me were the crew of the sloop, and some laborers engaged to unload it.|11|43|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
From the load itself came the earthly smell.|12|43|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
The bandage about the jaws was a silk handkerchief in which I had bound up my head, in default of my customary nightcap.|13|43|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
The tortures endured, however, were indubitably quite equal for the time, to those of actual sepulture.|0|44|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
They were fearfully–they were inconceivably hideous; but out of Evil proceeded Good; for their very excess wrought in my spirit an inevitable revulsion.|1|44|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
My soul acquired tone–acquired temper.|2|44|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I went abroad.|3|44|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I took vigorous exercise.|4|44|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I breathed the free air of Heaven.|5|44|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I thought upon other subjects than Death.|6|44|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
I discarded my medical books.|7|44|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
"""Buchan"" I burned."|8|44|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
"I read no ""Night Thoughts""–no fustian about churchyards–no bugaboo tales–such as this."|9|44|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
In short, I became a new man, and lived a man's life.|10|44|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
From that memorable night, I dismissed forever my charnel apprehensions, and with them vanished the cataleptic disorder, of which, perhaps, they had been less the consequence than the cause.|11|44|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
There are moments when, even to the sober eye of Reason, the world of our sad Humanity may assume the semblance of a Hell–but the imagination of man is no Carathis, to explore with impunity its every cavern.|0|45|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
Alas!|1|45|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
the grim legion of sepulchral terrors cannot be regarded as altogether fanciful–but, like the Demons in whose company Afrasiab made his voyage down the Oxus, they must sleep, or they will devour us–they must be suffered to slumber, or we perish.|2|45|The Premature Burial|July 31, 1844|Horror
WHATEVER doubt may still envelop the rationale of mesmerism, its startling facts are now almost universally admitted.|0|0|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Of these latter, those who doubt, are your mere doubters by profession–an unprofitable and disreputable tribe.|1|0|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
There can be no more absolute waste of time than the attempt to prove, at the present day, that man, by mere exercise of will can so impress his fellow as to cast him into an abnormal condition, of which the phenomena resemble very closely those of death, or at least resemble them more nearly than they do the phenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance; that, while in this state, the person so impressed employs only with effort, and then feebly, the external organs of sense, yet perceives, with keenly refined perception, and through channels supposed unknown, matters beyond the scope of the physical organs; that, moreover, his intellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and invigorated; that his sympathies with the person so impressing him are profound, and, finally, that his susceptibility to the impression increases with its frequency, while in the same proportion, the peculiar phenomena elicited are more extended and more pronounced.|2|0|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
I say that these–which are the laws of mesmerism in its general features–it would be supererogation to demonstrate; nor shall I inflict upon my readers so needless a demonstration to-day.|0|1|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
My purpose at present is a very different one indeed.|1|1|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
I am impelled, even in the teeth of a world of prejudice, to detail without comment, the very remarkable substance of a colloquy occurring between a sleep-waker and myself.|2|1|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
I had long been in the habit of mesmerizing the person in question (Mr. Vankirk), and the usual acute susceptibility and exaltation of the mesmeric perception had supervened.|0|2|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
For many months he had been laboring under confirmed phthisis, the more distressing effects of which had been relieved by my manipulations; and on the night of Wednesday, the fifteenth instant, I was summoned to his bedside.|1|2|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
The invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the heart, and breathed with great difficulty, having all the ordinary symptoms of asthma.|0|3|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
In spasms such as these he had usually found relief from the application of mustard to the nervous centres, but to-night this had been attempted in vain.|1|3|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
As I entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile, and although evidently in much bodily pain, appeared to be, mentally, quite at ease.|0|4|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
"""I sent for you to-night,"" he said, ""not so much to administer to my bodily ailment, as to satisfy me concerning certain physical impressions which, of late, have occasioned me much anxiety and surprise."|0|5|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
I need not tell you how skeptical I have hitherto been on the topic of the soul's immortality.|1|5|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
I cannot deny that there has always existed, as if in that very soul which I have been denying, a vague half-sentiment of its own existence.|2|5|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
But this half-sentiment at no time amounted to conviction.|3|5|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
With it my reason had nothing to do.|4|5|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
All attempts at logical inquiry resulted, indeed, in leaving me more sceptical than before.|5|5|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
I had been advised to study Cousin.|6|5|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
I studied him in his own works as well as in those of his European and American echoes.|7|5|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
The 'Charles Elwood' of Mr. Brownson for example, was placed in my hands.|8|5|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
I read it with profound attention.|9|5|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Throughout I found it logical but the portions which were not merely logical were unhappily the initial arguments of the disbelieving hero of the book.|10|5|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
In his summing up it seemed evident to me that the reasoner had not even succeeded in convincing himself.|11|5|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
His end had plainly forgotten his beginning, like the government of Trinculo.|12|5|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
In short, I was not long in perceiving that if man is to be intellectually convinced of his own immortality, he will never be so convinced by the mere abstractions which have been so long the fashion of the moralists of England, of France, and of Germany.|13|5|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Abstractions may amuse and exercise, but take no hold on the mind.|14|5|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Here upon earth, at least, philosophy, I am persuaded, will always in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things.|15|5|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
The will may assent–the soul–the intellect, never.|16|5|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
"""I repeat, then, that I only half felt, and never intellectually believed."|0|6|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
But latterly there has been a certain deepening of the feeling, until it has come so nearly to resemble the acquiesence of reason, that I find it difficult to distinguish the two.|1|6|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
I am enabled, too, plainly to trace this effect to the mesmeric influence.|2|6|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
I cannot better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that the mesmeric exaltation enables me to perceive a train of ratiocination which, in my abnormal existence, convinces, but which, in full accordance with the mesmeric phenomena, does not extend, except through its effect, into my normal condition.|3|6|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
In sleep-waking, the reasoning and its conclusion–the cause and its effect–are present together.|4|6|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
In my natural state, the cause vanishes, the effect only, and perhaps only partially, remains.|5|6|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
"""These considerations have led me to think that some good results might ensue from a series of well-directed questions propounded to me while mesmerized."|0|7|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
"You have often observed the profound self-cognizance evinced by the sleep-waker–the extensive knowledge he displays upon all points relating to the mesmeric condition itself, and from this self-cognizance may be deduced hints for the proper conduct of a catechism""."|1|7|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
I consented of course to make this experiment.|0|8|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
A few passes threw Mr. Vankirk into the mesmeric sleep.|1|8|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
His breathing became immediately more easy, and he seemed to suffer no physical uneasiness.|2|8|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
The following conversation then ensued:-V.|3|8|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
in the dialogue representing the patient, and P. myself.|4|8|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. Are you asleep?|0|9|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. Yes–no; I would rather sleep more soundly.|0|10|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. [After a few more passes.|0|11|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
] Do you sleep now?|1|11|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. Yes.|0|12|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. How do you think your present illness will result?|0|13|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. [After a long hesitation and speaking as if with effort.|0|14|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
] I must die.|1|14|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. Does the idea of death afflict you?|0|15|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. [Very quickly.|0|16|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
] No–no!|1|16|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. Are you pleased with the prospect?|0|17|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. If I were awake I should like to die, but now it is no matter.|0|18|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
The mesmeric condition is so near death as to content me.|1|18|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. I wish you would explain yourself, Mr. Vankirk.|0|19|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. I am willing to do so, but it requires more effort than I feel able to make.|0|20|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
You do not question me properly.|1|20|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. What then shall I ask?|0|21|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. You must begin at the beginning.|0|22|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. The beginning!|0|23|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
But where is the beginning?|1|23|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. You know that the beginning is GOD.|0|24|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
[This was said in a low, fluctuating tone, and with every sign of the most profound veneration.|1|24|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. What, then, is God?|0|25|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. [Hesitating for many minutes.|0|26|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
] I cannot tell.|1|26|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. Is not God spirit?|0|27|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
"V. While I was awake I knew what you meant by ""spirit,"" but now it seems only a word–such, for instance, as truth, beauty–a quality, I mean."|0|28|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. Is not God immaterial?|0|29|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. There is no immateriality–it is a mere word.|0|30|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
That which is not matter, is not at all–unless qualities are things.|1|30|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. Is God, then, material?|0|31|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. No.|0|32|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
[This reply startled me very much.|1|32|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. What, then, is he?|0|33|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. [After a long pause, and mutteringly.|0|34|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
] I see–but it is a thing difficult to tell.|1|34|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
[Another long pause.|2|34|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
] He is not spirit, for he exists.|3|34|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Nor is he matter, as you understand it.|4|34|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
But there are gradations of matter of which man knows nothing; the grosser impelling the finer, the finer pervading the grosser.|5|34|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
The atmosphere, for example, impels the electric principle, while the electric principle permeates the atmosphere.|6|34|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
These gradations of matter increase in rarity or fineness until we arrive at a matter unparticled–without particles–indivisible-one, and here the law of impulsion and permeation is modified.|7|34|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
The ultimate or unparticled matter not only permeates all things, but impels all things; and thus is all things within itself.|8|34|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
This matter is God.|9|34|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
"What men attempt to embody in the word ""thought,"" is this matter in motion."|10|34|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. The metaphysicians maintain that all action is reducible to motion and thinking, and that the latter is the origin of the former.|0|35|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. Yes; and I now see the confusion of idea.|0|36|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Motion is the action of mind, not of thinking.|1|36|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
The unparticled matter, or God, in quiescence is (as nearly as we can conceive it) what men call mind.|2|36|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
And the power of self-movement (equivalent in effect to human volition) is, in the unparticled matter, the result of its unity and omniprevalence; how, I know not, and now clearly see that I shall never know.|3|36|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
But the unparticled matter, set in motion by a law or quality existing within itself, is thinking.|4|36|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. Can you give me no more precise idea of what you term the unparticled matter?|0|37|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. The matters of which man is cognizant escape the senses in gradation.|0|38|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
We have, for example, a metal, a piece of wood, a drop of water, the atmosphere, a gas, caloric, electricity, the luminiferous ether.|1|38|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Now, we call all these things matter, and embrace all matter in one general definition; but in spite of this, there can be no two ideas more essentially distinct than that which we attach to a metal, and that which we attach to the luminiferous ether.|2|38|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
When we reach the latter, we feel an almost irresistible inclination to class it with spirit, or with nihilty.|3|38|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
The only consideration which restrains us is our conception of its atomic constitution; and here, even, we have to seek aid from our notion of an atom, as something possessing in infinite minuteness, solidity, palpability, weight.|4|38|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Destroy the idea of the atomic constitution and we should no longer be able to regard the ether as an entity, or, at least, as matter.|5|38|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
For want of a better word we might term it spirit.|6|38|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Take, now, a step beyond the luminiferous ether–conceive a matter as much more rare than the ether, as this ether is more rare than the metal, and we arrive at once (in spite of all the school dogmas) at a unique mass- an unparticled matter.|7|38|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
For although we may admit infinite littleness in the atoms themselves, the infinitude of littleness in the spaces between them is an absurdity.|8|38|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
There will be a point–there will be a degree of rarity at which, if the atoms are sufficiently numerous, the interspaces must vanish, and the mass absolutely coalesce.|9|38|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
But the consideration of the atomic constitution being now taken away, the nature of the mass inevitably glides into what we conceive of spirit.|10|38|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
It is clear, however, that it is as fully matter as before.|11|38|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
The truth is, it is impossible to conceive spirit since it is impossible to imagine what is not.|12|38|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
When we flatter ourselves that we have formed its conception, we have merely deceived our understanding by the consideration of infinitely rarefied matter.|13|38|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. There seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea of absolute coalescence;–and that is the very slight resistance experienced by the heavenly bodies in their revolutions through space- a resistance now ascertained, it is true, to exist in some degree, but which is, nevertheless, so slight as to have been quite overlooked by the sagacity even of Newton.|0|39|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
We know that the resistance of bodies is, chiefly, in proportion to their density.|1|39|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Absolute coalescence is absolute density.|2|39|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Where there are no interspaces, there can be no yielding.|3|39|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
An ether, absolutely dense, would put an infinitely more effectual stop to the progress of a star than would an ether of adamant or of iron.|4|39|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. Your objection is answered with an ease which is nearly in the ratio of its apparent unanswerability.|0|40|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
–As regards the progress of the star, it can make no difference whether the star passes through the ether or the ether through it.|1|40|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
There is no astronomical error more unaccountable than that which reconciles the known retardation of the comets with the idea of their passage through an ether, for, however rare this ether be supposed, it would put a stop to all sidereal revolution in a very far briefer period than has been admitted by those astronomers who have endeavored to slur over a point which they found it impossible to comprehend.|2|40|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
The retardation actually experienced is, on the other hand, about that which might be expected from the friction of the ether in the instantaneous passage through the orb.|3|40|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
In the one case, the retarding force is momentary and complete within itself–in the other it is endlessly accumulative.|4|40|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. But in all this–in this identification of mere matter with God–is there nothing of irreverence?|0|41|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
[I was forced to repeat this question before the sleep-waker fully comprehended my meaning.|1|41|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. Can you say why matter should be less reverenced than mind?|0|42|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
"But you forget that the matter of which ""mind"" or ""spirit"" of the schools, so far as regards its high capacities, and is, moreover, the ""matter"" of these schools at the same time."|1|42|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
God, with all the powers attributed to spirit, is but the perfection of matter.|2|42|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. You assert, then, that the unparticled matter, in motion, is thought.|0|43|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. In general, this motion is the universal thought of the universal mind.|0|44|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
This thought creates.|1|44|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
All created things are but the thoughts of God.|2|44|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
"P. You say, ""in general""."|0|45|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. Yes.|0|46|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
The universal mind is God.|1|46|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
For new individualities, matter is necessary.|2|46|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
"P. But you now speak of ""mind"" and ""matter"" as do the metaphysicians."|0|47|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. Yes–to avoid confusion.|0|48|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
"When I say ""mind,"" I mean the unparticled or ultimate matter, by ""matter,"" I intend all else."|1|48|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
"P. You were saying that ""for new individualities matter is necessary""."|0|49|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. Yes; for mind, existing unincorporate, is merely God.|0|50|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
To create individual, thinking beings, it was necessary to incarnate portions of the divine mind.|1|50|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Thus man is individualized.|2|50|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Divested of corporate investiture, he were God.|3|50|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Now the particular motion of the incarnated portions of the unparticled matter is the thought of man; as the motion of the whole is that of God.|4|50|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. You say that divested of the body man will be God?|0|51|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. [After much hesitation.|0|52|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
] I could not have said this; it is an absurdity.|1|52|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. [Referring to my notes.|0|53|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
"] You did say that ""divested of corporate investiture man were God""."|1|53|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. And this is true.|0|54|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Man thus divested would be God–would be unindividualized.|1|54|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
But he can never be thus divested–at least never will be–else we must imagine an action of God returning upon itself–a purposeless and futile action.|2|54|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Man is a creature.|3|54|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Creatures are thoughts of God.|4|54|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
It is the nature of thought to be irrevocable.|5|54|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. I do not comprehend.|0|55|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
You say that man will never put off the body?|1|55|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. I say that he will never be bodiless.|0|56|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. Explain.|0|57|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. There are two bodies–the rudimental and the complete, corresponding with the two conditions of the worm and the butterfly.|0|58|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
"What we call ""death,"" is but the painful metamorphosis."|1|58|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Our present incarnation is progressive, preparatory, temporary.|2|58|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Our future is perfected, ultimate, immortal.|3|58|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
The ultimate life is the full design.|4|58|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. But of the worm's metamorphosis we are palpably cognizant.|0|59|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. We, certainly–but not the worm.|0|60|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
The matter of which our rudimental body is composed, is within the ken of the organs of that body; or, more distinctly, our rudimental organs are adapted to the matter of which is formed the rudimental body, but not to that of which the ultimate is composed.|1|60|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
The ultimate body thus escapes our rudimental senses, and we perceive only the shell which falls, in decaying, from the inner form, not that inner form itself; but this inner form as well as the shell, is appreciable by those who have already acquired the ultimate life.|2|60|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. You have often said that the mesmeric state very nearly resembles death.|0|61|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
How is this?|1|61|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. When I say that it resembles death, I mean that it resembles the ultimate life; for when I am entranced the senses of my rudimental life are in abeyance and I perceive external things directly, without organs, through a medium which I shall employ in the ultimate, unorganized life.|0|62|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. Unorganized?|0|63|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. Yes; organs are contrivances by which the individual is brought into sensible relation with particular classes and forms of matter, to the exclusion of other classes and forms.|0|64|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
The organs of man are adapted to his rudimental condition, and to that only; his ultimate condition, being unorganized, is of unlimited comprehension in all points but one–the nature of the volition of God–that is to say, the motion of the unparticled matter.|1|64|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
You may have a distinct idea of the ultimate body by conceiving it to be entire brain.|2|64|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
This it is not, but a conception of this nature will bring you near a comprehension of what it is.|3|64|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
A luminous body imparts vibration to the luminiferous ether.|4|64|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
The vibrations generate similar ones within the retina; these again communicate similar ones to the optic nerve.|5|64|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
The nerve conveys similar ones to the brain; the brain, also, similar ones to the unparticled matter which permeates it.|6|64|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
The motion of this latter is thought, of which perception is the first undulation.|7|64|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
This is the mode by which the mind of the rudimental life communicates with the external world; and this external world is, to the rudimental life, limited, through the idiosyncrasy of its organs.|8|64|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
But in the ultimate, unorganized life, the external world reaches the whole body, (which is of a substance having affinity to brain, as I have said,) with no other intervention than that of an infinitely rarer ether than even the luminiferous; and to this ether–in unison with it–the whole body vibrates, setting in motion the unparticled matter which permeates it.|9|64|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
It is to the absence of idiosyncratic organs, therefore, that we must attribute the nearly unlimited perception of the ultimate life.|10|64|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
To rudimental beings, organs are the cages necessary to confine them until fledged.|11|64|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
"P. You speak of rudimental ""beings""."|0|65|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Are there other rudimental thinking beings than man?|1|65|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. The multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebulae, planets, suns, and other bodies which are neither nebulae, suns, nor planets, is for the sole purpose of supplying pabulum for the idiosyncrasy of the organs of an infinity of rudimental beings.|0|66|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
But for the necessity of the rudimental, prior to the ultimate life, there would have been no bodies such as these.|1|66|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Each of these is tenanted by a distinct variety of organic rudimental thinking creatures.|2|66|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
In all, the organs vary with the features of the place tenanted.|3|66|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
At death, or metamorphosis, these creatures, enjoying the ultimate life–immortality–and cognizant of all secrets but the one, act all things and pass every where by mere volition:–indwelling, not the stars, which to us seem the sole palpabilities, and for the accommodation of which we blindly deem space created–but that space itself–that infinity of which the truly substantive vastness swallows up the star-shadows–blotting them out as non-entities from the perception of the angels.|4|66|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
"P. You say that ""but for the necessity of the rudimental life, there would have been no stars""."|0|67|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
But why this necessity?|1|67|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. In the inorganic life, as well as in the inorganic matter generally, there is nothing to impede the action of one simple unique law–the Divine Volition.|0|68|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
With the view of producing impediment, the organic life and matter (complex, substantial and law- encumbered) were contrived.|1|68|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. But again–why need this impediment have been produced?|0|69|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. The result of law inviolate is perfection–right–negative happiness.|0|70|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
The result of law violate is imperfection, wrong, positive pain.|1|70|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Through the impediments afforded by the number, complexity, and substantiality of the laws of organic life and matter, the violation of law is rendered, to a certain extent, practicable.|2|70|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Thus pain, which is the inorganic life is impossible, is possible in the organic.|3|70|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
P. But to what good end is pain thus rendered possible?|0|71|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
V. All things are either good or bad by comparison.|0|72|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
A sufficient analysis will show that pleasure in all cases, is but the contrast of pain.|1|72|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Positive pleasure is a mere idea.|2|72|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
To be happy at any one point we must have suffered at the same.|3|72|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Never to suffer would have been never to have been blessed.|4|72|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
But it has been shown that, in the inorganic life, pain cannot be; thus the necessity for the organic.|5|72|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
The pain of the primitive life of Earth, is the sole basis of the bliss of the ultimate life in Heaven.|6|72|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
"P. Still there is one of your expressions which I find it impossible to comprehend–""the truly substantive vastness of infinity""."|0|73|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
"V. This, probably, is because you have no sufficiently generic conception of the term ""substance"" itself."|0|74|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
We must not regard it as a quality, but as a sentiment:–it is the perception, in thinking beings, of the adaptation of matter to their organization.|1|74|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
There are many things on the Earth, which would be nihility to the inhabitants of Venus–many things visible and tangible in Venus, which we could not be brought to appreciate as existing at all.|2|74|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
"But to the inorganic beings–to the angels–the whole of the unparticled matter is substance; that is to say, the whole of what we term ""space,"" is to them the truest substantiality;–the stars, meantime, through what we consider their materiality, escaping the angelic sense, just in proportion as the unparticled matter, through what we consider its immateriality, eludes the organic."|3|74|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
As the sleep-waker pronounced these latter words, in a feeble tone, I observed on his countenance a singular expression, which somewhat alarmed me, and induced me to awake him at once.|0|75|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
No sooner had I done this than, with a bright smile irradiating all his features, he fell back upon his pillow and expired.|1|75|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
I noticed that in less than a minute afterward his corpse had all the stern rigidity of stone.|2|75|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
His brow was of the coldness of ice.|3|75|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Thus, ordinarily, should it have appeared, only after long pressure from Azrael's hand.|4|75|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
Had the sleep-waker, indeed, during the latter portion of his discourse, been addressing me from out the regions of the shadows?|5|75|Mesmeric Revelation|August 1844|Science fiction
"SOME YEARS ago, I engaged passage from Charleston, S. C, to the city of New York, in the fine packet-ship ""Independence,"" Captain Hardy."|0|0|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
We were to sail on the fifteenth of the month (June), weather permitting; and on the fourteenth, I went on board to arrange some matters in my state-room.|1|0|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
I found that we were to have a great many passengers, including a more than usual number of ladies.|0|1|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
On the list were several of my acquaintances, and among other names, I was rejoiced to see that of Mr. Cornelius Wyatt, a young artist, for whom I entertained feelings of warm friendship.|1|1|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
He had been with me a fellow-student at C- University, where we were very much together.|2|1|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
He had the ordinary temperament of genius, and was a compound of misanthropy, sensibility, and enthusiasm.|3|1|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
To these qualities he united the warmest and truest heart which ever beat in a human bosom.|4|1|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
I observed that his name was carded upon three state-rooms; and, upon again referring to the list of passengers, I found that he had engaged passage for himself, wife, and two sisters–his own.|0|2|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
The state-rooms were sufficiently roomy, and each had two berths, one above the other.|1|2|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
These berths, to be sure, were so exceedingly narrow as to be insufficient for more than one person; still, I could not comprehend why there were three state-rooms for these four persons.|2|2|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
I was, just at that epoch, in one of those moody frames of mind which make a man abnormally inquisitive about trifles: and I confess, with shame, that I busied myself in a variety of ill-bred and preposterous conjectures about this matter of the supernumerary state-room.|3|2|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
It was no business of mine, to be sure, but with none the less pertinacity did I occupy myself in attempts to resolve the enigma.|4|2|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
At last I reached a conclusion which wrought in me great wonder why I had not arrived at it before.|5|2|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"""It is a servant of course,"" I said; ""what a fool I am, not sooner to have thought of so obvious a solution""!"|6|2|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"And then I again repaired to the list–but here I saw distinctly that no servant was to come with the party, although, in fact, it had been the original design to bring one–for the words ""and servant"" had been first written and then overscored."|7|2|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"""Oh, extra baggage, to be sure,"" I now said to myself–""something he wishes not to be put in the hold–something to be kept under his own eye–ah, I have it–a painting or so–and this is what he has been bargaining about with Nicolino, the Italian Jew""."|8|2|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
This idea satisfied me, and I dismissed my curiosity for the nonce.|9|2|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Wyatt's two sisters I knew very well, and most amiable and clever girls they were.|0|3|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
His wife he had newly married, and I had never yet seen her.|1|3|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
He had often talked about her in my presence, however, and in his usual style of enthusiasm.|2|3|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
He described her as of surpassing beauty, wit, and accomplishment.|3|3|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
I was, therefore, quite anxious to make her acquaintance.|4|3|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
On the day in which I visited the ship (the fourteenth), Wyatt and party were also to visit it–so the captain informed me–and I waited on board an hour longer than I had designed, in hope of being presented to the bride, but then an apology came.|0|4|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"""Mrs. W. was a little indisposed, and would decline coming on board until to-morrow, at the hour of sailing""."|1|4|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"The morrow having arrived, I was going from my hotel to the wharf, when Captain Hardy met me and said that, ""owing to circumstances"" (a stupid but convenient phrase), ""he rather thought the 'Independence' would not sail for a day or two, and that when all was ready, he would send up and let me know""."|0|5|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"This I thought strange, for there was a stiff southerly breeze; but as ""the circumstances"" were not forthcoming, although I pumped for them with much perseverance, I had nothing to do but to return home and digest my impatience at leisure."|1|5|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
I did not receive the expected message from the captain for nearly a week.|0|6|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
It came at length, however, and I immediately went on board.|1|6|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
The ship was crowded with passengers, and every thing was in the bustle attendant upon making sail.|2|6|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Wyatt's party arrived in about ten minutes after myself.|3|6|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
There were the two sisters, the bride, and the artist- the latter in one of his customary fits of moody misanthropy.|4|6|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
I was too well used to these, however, to pay them any special attention.|5|6|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
He did not even introduce me to his wife–this courtesy devolving, per force, upon his sister Marian–a very sweet and intelligent girl, who, in a few hurried words, made us acquainted.|6|6|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Mrs. Wyatt had been closely veiled; and when she raised her veil, in acknowledging my bow, I confess that I was very profoundly astonished.|0|7|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
I should have been much more so, however, had not long experience advised me not to trust, with too implicit a reliance, the enthusiastic descriptions of my friend, the artist, when indulging in comments upon the loveliness of woman.|1|7|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
When beauty was the theme, I well knew with what facility he soared into the regions of the purely ideal.|2|7|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
The truth is, I could not help regarding Mrs. Wyatt as a decidedly plain-looking woman.|0|8|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
If not positively ugly, she was not, I think, very far from it.|1|8|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
She was dressed, however, in exquisite taste–and then I had no doubt that she had captivated my friend's heart by the more enduring graces of the intellect and soul.|2|8|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
My old inquisitiveness now returned.|0|9|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
There was no servant–that was a settled point.|1|9|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
I looked, therefore, for the extra baggage.|2|9|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
After some delay, a cart arrived at the wharf, with an oblong pine box, which was every thing that seemed to be expected.|3|9|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Immediately upon its arrival we made sail, and in a short time were safely over the bar and standing out to sea.|4|9|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
The box in question was, as I say, oblong.|0|10|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
It was about six feet in length by two and a half in breadth; I observed it attentively, and like to be precise.|1|10|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Now this shape was peculiar; and no sooner had I seen it, than I took credit to myself for the accuracy of my guessing.|2|10|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"I had reached the conclusion, it will be remembered, that the extra baggage of my friend, the artist, would prove to be pictures, or at least a picture; for I knew he had been for several weeks in conference with Nicolino:–and now here was a box, which, from its shape, could possibly contain nothing in the world but a copy of Leonardo's ""Last Supper;"" and a copy of this very ""Last Supper,"" done by Rubini the younger, at Florence, I had known, for some time, to be in the possession of Nicolino."|3|10|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
This point, therefore, I considered as sufficiently settled.|4|10|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
I chuckled excessively when I thought of my acumen.|5|10|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
It was the first time I had ever known Wyatt to keep from me any of his artistical secrets; but here he evidently intended to steal a march upon me, and smuggle a fine picture to New York, under my very nose; expecting me to know nothing of the matter.|6|10|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
I resolved to quiz him well, now and hereafter.|7|10|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
One thing, however, annoyed me not a little.|0|11|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
The box did not go into the extra state-room.|1|11|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
It was deposited in Wyatt's own; and there, too, it remained, occupying very nearly the whole of the floor–no doubt to the exceeding discomfort of the artist and his wife;–this the more especially as the tar or paint with which it was lettered in sprawling capitals, emitted a strong, disagreeable, and, to my fancy, a peculiarly disgusting odor.|2|11|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"On the lid were painted the words–""Mrs. Adelaide Curtis, Albany, New York."|3|11|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Charge of Cornelius Wyatt, Esq.|4|11|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
This side up.|5|11|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"To be handled with care""."|6|11|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Now, I was aware that Mrs. Adelaide Curtis, of Albany, was the artist's wife's mother,–but then I looked upon the whole address as a mystification, intended especially for myself.|0|12|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
I made up my mind, of course, that the box and contents would never get farther north than the studio of my misanthropic friend, in Chambers Street, New York.|1|12|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
For the first three or four days we had fine weather, although the wind was dead ahead; having chopped round to the northward, immediately upon our losing sight of the coast.|0|13|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
The passengers were, consequently, in high spirits and disposed to be social.|1|13|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
I must except, however, Wyatt and his sisters, who behaved stiffly, and, I could not help thinking, uncourteously to the rest of the party.|2|13|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Wyatt's conduct I did not so much regard.|3|13|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
He was gloomy, even beyond his usual habit–in fact he was morose–but in him I was prepared for eccentricity.|4|13|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
For the sisters, however, I could make no excuse.|5|13|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
They secluded themselves in their staterooms during the greater part of the passage, and absolutely refused, although I repeatedly urged them, to hold communication with any person on board.|6|13|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Mrs. Wyatt herself was far more agreeable.|0|14|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
That is to say, she was chatty; and to be chatty is no slight recommendation at sea.|1|14|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
She became excessively intimate with most of the ladies; and, to my profound astonishment, evinced no equivocal disposition to coquet with the men.|2|14|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
She amused us all very much.|3|14|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"I say ""amused""–and scarcely know how to explain myself."|4|14|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
The truth is, I soon found that Mrs. W. was far oftener laughed at than with.|5|14|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"The gentlemen said little about her; but the ladies, in a little while, pronounced her ""a good-hearted thing, rather indifferent looking, totally uneducated, and decidedly vulgar""."|6|14|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
The great wonder was, how Wyatt had been entrapped into such a match.|7|14|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Wealth was the general solution–but this I knew to be no solution at all; for Wyatt had told me that she neither brought him a dollar nor had any expectations from any source whatever.|8|14|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"""He had married,"" he said, ""for love, and for love only; and his bride was far more than worthy of his love""."|9|14|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
When I thought of these expressions, on the part of my friend, I confess that I felt indescribably puzzled.|10|14|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Could it be possible that he was taking leave of his senses?|11|14|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
What else could I think?|12|14|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
He, so refined, so intellectual, so fastidious, with so exquisite a perception of the faulty, and so keen an appreciation of the beautiful!|13|14|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"To be sure, the lady seemed especially fond of him–particularly so in his absence–when she made herself ridiculous by frequent quotations of what had been said by her ""beloved husband, Mr. Wyatt""."|14|14|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"The word ""husband"" seemed forever–to use one of her own delicate expressions–forever ""on the tip of her tongue""."|15|14|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
In the meantime, it was observed by all on board, that he avoided her in the most pointed manner, and, for the most part, shut himself up alone in his state-room, where, in fact, he might have been said to live altogether, leaving his wife at full liberty to amuse herself as she thought best, in the public society of the main cabin.|16|14|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
My conclusion, from what I saw and heard, was, that, the artist, by some unaccountable freak of fate, or perhaps in some fit of enthusiastic and fanciful passion, had been induced to unite himself with a person altogether beneath him, and that the natural result, entire and speedy disgust, had ensued.|0|15|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"I pitied him from the bottom of my heart–but could not, for that reason, quite forgive his incommunicativeness in the matter of the ""Last Supper""."|1|15|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
For this I resolved to have my revenge.|2|15|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
One day he came upon deck, and, taking his arm as had been my wont, I sauntered with him backward and forward.|0|16|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
His gloom, however (which I considered quite natural under the circumstances), seemed entirely unabated.|1|16|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
He said little, and that moodily, and with evident effort.|2|16|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
I ventured a jest or two, and he made a sickening attempt at a smile.|3|16|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Poor fellow!|4|16|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
–as I thought of his wife, I wondered that he could have heart to put on even the semblance of mirth.|5|16|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
I determined to commence a series of covert insinuations, or innuendoes, about the oblong box–just to let him perceive, gradually, that I was not altogether the butt, or victim, of his little bit of pleasant mystification.|6|16|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
My first observation was by way of opening a masked battery.|7|16|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"I said something about the ""peculiar shape of that box-,"" and, as I spoke the words, I smiled knowingly, winked, and touched him gently with my forefinger in the ribs."|8|16|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
The manner in which Wyatt received this harmless pleasantry convinced me, at once, that he was mad.|0|17|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
At first he stared at me as if he found it impossible to comprehend the witticism of my remark; but as its point seemed slowly to make its way into his brain, his eyes, in the same proportion, seemed protruding from their sockets.|1|17|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Then he grew very red–then hideously pale–then, as if highly amused with what I had insinuated, he began a loud and boisterous laugh, which, to my astonishment, he kept up, with gradually increasing vigor, for ten minutes or more.|2|17|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
In conclusion, he fell flat and heavily upon the deck.|3|17|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
When I ran to uplift him, to all appearance he was dead.|4|17|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
I called assistance, and, with much difficulty, we brought him to himself.|0|18|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Upon reviving he spoke incoherently for some time.|1|18|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
At length we bled him and put him to bed.|2|18|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
The next morning he was quite recovered, so far as regarded his mere bodily health.|3|18|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Of his mind I say nothing, of course.|4|18|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
I avoided him during the rest of the passage, by advice of the captain, who seemed to coincide with me altogether in my views of his insanity, but cautioned me to say nothing on this head to any person on board.|5|18|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Several circumstances occurred immediately after this fit of Wyatt which contributed to heighten the curiosity with which I was already possessed.|0|19|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Among other things, this: I had been nervous–drank too much strong green tea, and slept ill at night–in fact, for two nights I could not be properly said to sleep at all.|1|19|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Now, my state-room opened into the main cabin, or dining-room, as did those of all the single men on board.|2|19|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Wyatt's three rooms were in the after-cabin, which was separated from the main one by a slight sliding door, never locked even at night.|3|19|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
As we were almost constantly on a wind, and the breeze was not a little stiff, the ship heeled to leeward very considerably; and whenever her starboard side was to leeward, the sliding door between the cabins slid open, and so remained, nobody taking the trouble to get up and shut it.|4|19|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
But my berth was in such a position, that when my own state-room door was open, as well as the sliding door in question (and my own door was always open on account of the heat,) I could see into the after-cabin quite distinctly, and just at that portion of it, too, where were situated the state-rooms of Mr. Wyatt.|5|19|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Well, during two nights (not consecutive) while I lay awake, I clearly saw Mrs. W., about eleven o'clock upon each night, steal cautiously from the state-room of Mr. W., and enter the extra room, where she remained until daybreak, when she was called by her husband and went back.|6|19|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
That they were virtually separated was clear.|7|19|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
They had separate apartments–no doubt in contemplation of a more permanent divorce; and here, after all I thought was the mystery of the extra state-room.|8|19|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
There was another circumstance, too, which interested me much.|0|20|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
During the two wakeful nights in question, and immediately after the disappearance of Mrs. Wyatt into the extra state-room, I was attracted by certain singular cautious, subdued noises in that of her husband.|1|20|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
After listening to them for some time, with thoughtful attention, I at length succeeded perfectly in translating their import.|2|20|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
They were sounds occasioned by the artist in prying open the oblong box, by means of a chisel and mallet–the latter being apparently muffled, or deadened, by some soft woollen or cotton substance in which its head was enveloped.|3|20|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
In this manner I fancied I could distinguish the precise moment when he fairly disengaged the lid–also, that I could determine when he removed it altogether, and when he deposited it upon the lower berth in his room; this latter point I knew, for example, by certain slight taps which the lid made in striking against the wooden edges of the berth, as he endeavored to lay it down very gently–there being no room for it on the floor.|0|21|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
After this there was a dead stillness, and I heard nothing more, upon either occasion, until nearly daybreak; unless, perhaps, I may mention a low sobbing, or murmuring sound, so very much suppressed as to be nearly inaudible–if, indeed, the whole of this latter noise were not rather produced by my own imagination.|1|21|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
I say it seemed to resemble sobbing or sighing–but, of course, it could not have been either.|2|21|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
I rather think it was a ringing in my own ears.|3|21|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Mr. Wyatt, no doubt, according to custom, was merely giving the rein to one of his hobbies–indulging in one of his fits of artistic enthusiasm.|4|21|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
He had opened his oblong box, in order to feast his eyes on the pictorial treasure within.|5|21|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
There was nothing in this, however, to make him sob.|6|21|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
I repeat, therefore, that it must have been simply a freak of my own fancy, distempered by good Captain Hardy's green tea.|7|21|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
just before dawn, on each of the two nights of which I speak, I distinctly heard Mr. Wyatt replace the lid upon the oblong box, and force the nails into their old places by means of the muffled mallet.|8|21|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Having done this, he issued from his state-room, fully dressed, and proceeded to call Mrs. W. from hers.|9|21|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
We had been at sea seven days, and were now off Cape Hatteras, when there came a tremendously heavy blow from the southwest.|0|22|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
We were, in a measure, prepared for it, however, as the weather had been holding out threats for some time.|1|22|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Every thing was made snug, alow and aloft; and as the wind steadily freshened, we lay to, at length, under spanker and foretopsail, both double-reefed.|2|22|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
In this trim we rode safely enough for forty-eight hours–the ship proving herself an excellent sea-boat in many respects, and shipping no water of any consequence.|0|23|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
At the end of this period, however, the gale had freshened into a hurricane, and our after–sail split into ribbons, bringing us so much in the trough of the water that we shipped several prodigious seas, one immediately after the other.|1|23|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
By this accident we lost three men overboard with the caboose, and nearly the whole of the larboard bulwarks.|2|23|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Scarcely had we recovered our senses, before the foretopsail went into shreds, when we got up a storm stay–sail and with this did pretty well for some hours, the ship heading the sea much more steadily than before.|3|23|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
The gale still held on, however, and we saw no signs of its abating.|0|24|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
The rigging was found to be ill-fitted, and greatly strained; and on the third day of the blow, about five in the afternoon, our mizzen-mast, in a heavy lurch to windward, went by the board.|1|24|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
For an hour or more, we tried in vain to get rid of it, on account of the prodigious rolling of the ship; and, before we had succeeded, the carpenter came aft and announced four feet of water in the hold.|2|24|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
To add to our dilemma, we found the pumps choked and nearly useless.|3|24|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
All was now confusion and despair–but an effort was made to lighten the ship by throwing overboard as much of her cargo as could be reached, and by cutting away the two masts that remained.|0|25|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
This we at last accomplished–but we were still unable to do any thing at the pumps; and, in the meantime, the leak gained on us very fast.|1|25|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
At sundown, the gale had sensibly diminished in violence, and as the sea went down with it, we still entertained faint hopes of saving ourselves in the boats.|0|26|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
At eight P. M., the clouds broke away to windward, and we had the advantage of a full moon–a piece of good fortune which served wonderfully to cheer our drooping spirits.|1|26|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
After incredible labor we succeeded, at length, in getting the longboat over the side without material accident, and into this we crowded the whole of the crew and most of the passengers.|0|27|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
This party made off immediately, and, after undergoing much suffering, finally arrived, in safety, at Ocracoke Inlet, on the third day after the wreck.|1|27|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Fourteen passengers, with the captain, remained on board, resolving to trust their fortunes to the jolly-boat at the stern.|0|28|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
We lowered it without difficulty, although it was only by a miracle that we prevented it from swamping as it touched the water.|1|28|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
It contained, when afloat, the captain and his wife, Mr. Wyatt and party, a Mexican officer, wife, four children, and myself, with a negro valet.|2|28|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
We had no room, of course, for any thing except a few positively necessary instruments, some provisions, and the clothes upon our backs.|0|29|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
No one had thought of even attempting to save any thing more.|1|29|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
What must have been the astonishment of all, then, when having proceeded a few fathoms from the ship, Mr. Wyatt stood up in the stern-sheets, and coolly demanded of Captain Hardy that the boat should be put back for the purpose of taking in his oblong box!|2|29|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"""Sit down, Mr. Wyatt,"" replied the captain, somewhat sternly, ""you will capsize us if you do not sit quite still."|0|30|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"Our gunwhale is almost in the water now""."|1|30|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"""The box""!"|0|31|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"vociferated Mr. Wyatt, still standing–""the box, I say!"|1|31|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Captain Hardy, you cannot, you will not refuse me.|2|31|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Its weight will be but a trifle–it is nothing–mere nothing.|3|31|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"By the mother who bore you–for the love of Heaven–by your hope of salvation, I implore you to put back for the box""!"|4|31|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"""Mr. Wyatt, you are mad."|0|33|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
I cannot listen to you.|1|33|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Sit down, I say, or you will swamp the boat.|2|33|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Stay–hold him–seize him!|3|33|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
–he is about to spring overboard!|4|33|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"There–I knew it–he is over""!"|5|33|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
As the captain said this, Mr. Wyatt, in fact, sprang from the boat, and, as we were yet in the lee of the wreck, succeeded, by almost superhuman exertion, in getting hold of a rope which hung from the fore-chains.|0|34|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
In another moment he was on board, and rushing frantically down into the cabin.|1|34|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
In the meantime, we had been swept astern of the ship, and being quite out of her lee, were at the mercy of the tremendous sea which was still running.|0|35|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
We made a determined effort to put back, but our little boat was like a feather in the breath of the tempest.|1|35|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
We saw at a glance that the doom of the unfortunate artist was sealed.|2|35|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
As our distance from the wreck rapidly increased, the madman (for as such only could we regard him) was seen to emerge from the companion–way, up which by dint of strength that appeared gigantic, he dragged, bodily, the oblong box.|0|36|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
While we gazed in the extremity of astonishment, he passed, rapidly, several turns of a three-inch rope, first around the box and then around his body.|1|36|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
In another instant both body and box were in the sea–disappearing suddenly, at once and forever.|2|36|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
We lingered awhile sadly upon our oars, with our eyes riveted upon the spot.|0|37|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
At length we pulled away.|1|37|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
The silence remained unbroken for an hour.|2|37|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Finally, I hazarded a remark.|3|37|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"""Did you observe, captain, how suddenly they sank?"|0|38|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Was not that an exceedingly singular thing?|1|38|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"I confess that I entertained some feeble hope of his final deliverance, when I saw him lash himself to the box, and commit himself to the sea""."|2|38|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"""They sank as a matter of course,"" replied the captain, ""and that like a shot."|0|39|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"They will soon rise again, however–but not till the salt melts""."|1|39|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"""The salt""!"|0|40|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
I ejaculated.|1|40|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"""Hush""!"|0|41|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
said the captain, pointing to the wife and sisters of the deceased.|1|41|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"""We must talk of these things at some more appropriate time""."|2|41|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
We suffered much, and made a narrow escape, but fortune befriended us, as well as our mates in the long-boat.|0|42|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
We landed, in fine, more dead than alive, after four days of intense distress, upon the beach opposite Roanoke Island.|1|42|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
We remained here a week, were not ill-treated by the wreckers, and at length obtained a passage to New York.|2|42|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
"About a month after the loss of the ""Independence,"" I happened to meet Captain Hardy in Broadway."|0|43|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Our conversation turned, naturally, upon the disaster, and especially upon the sad fate of poor Wyatt.|1|43|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
I thus learned the following particulars.|2|43|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
The artist had engaged passage for himself, wife, two sisters and a servant.|0|44|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
His wife was, indeed, as she had been represented, a most lovely, and most accomplished woman.|1|44|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
On the morning of the fourteenth of June (the day in which I first visited the ship), the lady suddenly sickened and died.|2|44|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
The young husband was frantic with grief–but circumstances imperatively forbade the deferring his voyage to New York.|3|44|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
It was necessary to take to her mother the corpse of his adored wife, and, on the other hand, the universal prejudice which would prevent his doing so openly was well known.|4|44|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Nine-tenths of the passengers would have abandoned the ship rather than take passage with a dead body.|5|44|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
In this dilemma, Captain Hardy arranged that the corpse, being first partially embalmed, and packed, with a large quantity of salt, in a box of suitable dimensions, should be conveyed on board as merchandise.|0|45|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
Nothing was to be said of the lady's decease; and, as it was well understood that Mr. Wyatt had engaged passage for his wife, it became necessary that some person should personate her during the voyage.|1|45|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
This the deceased lady's-maid was easily prevailed on to do.|2|45|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
The extra state-room, originally engaged for this girl during her mistress' life, was now merely retained.|3|45|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
In this state-room the pseudo-wife, slept, of course, every night.|4|45|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
In the daytime she performed, to the best of her ability, the part of her mistress–whose person, it had been carefully ascertained, was unknown to any of the passengers on board.|5|45|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
My own mistake arose, naturally enough, through too careless, too inquisitive, and too impulsive a temperament.|0|46|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
But of late, it is a rare thing that I sleep soundly at night.|1|46|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
There is a countenance which haunts me, turn as I will.|2|46|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
There is an hysterical laugh which will forever ring within my ears.|3|46|The Oblong Box|September 1844|Horror / Ratiocination
It was a chilly November afternoon.|0|1|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
I had just consummated an unusually hearty dinner, of which the dyspeptic truffe formed not the least important item, and was sitting alone in the dining-room, with my feet upon the fender, and at my elbow a small table which I had rolled up to the fire, and upon which were some apologies for dessert, with some miscellaneous bottles of wine, spirit, and liqueur.|1|1|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"In the morning I had been reading Glover's ""Leonidas,"" Wilkies ""Epigoniad,"" Lamartine's ""Pilgrimage,"" Barlow's ""Columbiad,"" Tuckermann's ""Sicily,"" and Griswold's ""Curiosities""; I am willing to confess, therefore, that I now felt a little stupid."|2|1|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
I made effort to arouse myself by aid of frequent Lafitte, and, all failing, I betook myself to a stray newspaper in despair.|3|1|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"Having carefully perused the column of ""houses to let,"" and the column of ""dogs lost,"" and then the two columns of ""wives and apprentices runaway,"" I attacked with great resolution the editorial matter, and, reading it from beginning to end without understanding a syllable, conceived the possibility of its being Chinese, and so re-read it from the end to the beginning, but with no more satisfactory result."|4|1|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""The avenues to death are numerous and strange."|0|4|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
A London paper mentions the decease of a person from a singular cause.|1|4|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
He was playing at 'puff the dart,' which is played with a long needle inserted in some worsted, and blown at a target through a tin tube.|2|4|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
He placed the needle at the wrong end of the tube, and drawing his breath strongly to puff the dart forward with force, drew the needle into his throat.|3|4|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"It entered the lungs, and in a few days killed him""."|4|4|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Upon seeing this I fell into a great rage, without exactly knowing why.|0|5|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""This thing,"" I exclaimed, ""is a contemptible falsehood;a poor hoax;the lees of the invention of some pitiable penny-a-liner;of some wretched concoctor of accidents in Cocaigne."|1|5|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"These fellows, knowing the extravagant gullibility of the age, set their wits to work in the imagination of improbable possibilities;of odd accidents, as they term them; but to a reflecting intellect (like mine,"" I added, in parenthesis, putting my forefinger unconsciously to the side of my nose), ""to a contemplative understanding such as I myself possess, it seems evident at once that the marvelous increase of late in these 'odd accidents' is by far the oddest accident of all."|2|5|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
For my own part, I intend to believe nothing henceforward that has anything of the 'singular' about it.|3|5|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""Mein Gott, den, vat a vool you bees for dat""!"|0|6|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
replied one of the most remarkable voices I ever heard.|1|6|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
At first I took it for a rumbling in my ears;such as man sometimes experiences when getting very drunk- but, upon second thought, I considered the sound as more nearly resembling that which proceeds from an empty barrel beaten with a big stick; and, in fact, this I should have concluded it to be, but for the articulation of the syllables and words.|2|6|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
I am by no means naturally nervous, and the very few glasses of Lafitte which I had sipped served to embolden me a little, so that I felt nothing of trepidation, but merely uplifted my eyes with a leisurely movement, and looked carefully around the room for the intruder.|3|6|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
I could not, however, perceive any one at all.|4|6|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""Humph""!"|0|7|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"resumed the voice, as I continued my survey, ""you mus pe so dronk as de pig, den, for not zee me as I zit here at your zide""."|1|7|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Hereupon I bethought me of looking immediately before my nose, and there, sure enough, confronting me at the table sat a personage nondescript, although not altogether indescribable.|0|8|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
His body was a wine-pipe, or a rum-puncheon, or something of that character, and had a truly Falstaffian air.|1|8|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
In its nether extremity were inserted two kegs, which seemed to answer all the purposes of legs.|2|8|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
For arms there dangled from the upper portion of the carcass two tolerably long bottles, with the necks outward for hands.|3|8|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
All the head that I saw the monster possessed of was one of those Hessian canteens which resemble a large snuff-box with a hole in the middle of the lid.|4|8|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
This canteen (with a funnel on its top, like a cavalier cap slouched over the eyes) was set on edge upon the puncheon, with the hole toward myself; and through this hole, which seemed puckered up like the mouth of a very precise old maid, the creature was emitting certain rumbling and grumbling noises which he evidently intended for intelligible talk.|5|8|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""I zay,"" said he, ""you mos pe dronk as de pig, vor zit dare and not zee me zit ere; and I zay, doo, you most pe pigger vool as de goose, vor to dispelief vat iz print in de print."|0|9|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"'Tiz de troof-dat it iz;eberry vord ob it""."|1|9|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""Who are you, pray""?"|0|10|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"said I, with much dignity, although somewhat puzzled; ""how did you get here?"|1|10|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"and what is it you are talking about""?"|2|10|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""Az vor ow I com'd ere,"" replied the figure, ""dat iz none of your pizzness; and as vor vat I be talking apout, I be talk apout vot I tink proper; and as vor who I be, vy dat is de very ting I com'd here for to let you zee for yourzelf""."|0|11|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""You are a drunken vagabond,"" said I, ""and I shall ring the bell and order my footman to kick you into the street""."|0|12|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""He!"|0|13|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor

"said the fellow, ""hu!"|3|13|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor

hu!|5|13|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"dat you can't do""."|6|13|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""Can't do""!"|0|14|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"said I, ""what do you mean?"|1|14|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
";can't do what""?"|2|14|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""Ring de pell,"" he replied, attempting a grin with his little villainous mouth."|0|15|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Upon this I made an effort to get up, in order to put my threat into execution; but the ruffian just reached across the table very deliberately, and hitting me a tap on the forehead with the neck of one of the long bottles, knocked me back into the arm-chair from which I had half arisen.|0|16|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
I was utterly astounded; and, for a moment, was quite at a loss what to do.|1|16|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
In the meantime, he continued his talk.|2|16|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""You zee,"" said he, ""it iz te bess vor zit still; and now you shall know who I pe."|0|17|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Look at me!|1|17|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor

"I am te Angel ov te Odd""!"|3|17|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""And odd enough, too,"" I ventured to reply; ""but I was always under the impression that an angel had wings""."|0|18|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""Te wing""!"|0|19|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"he cried, highly incensed, ""vat I pe do mit te wing?"|1|19|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Mein Gott!|2|19|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"do you take me vor a shicken""?"|3|19|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""No;oh, no""!"|0|20|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"I replied, much alarmed, ""you are no chicken- certainly not""."|1|20|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""Well, den, zit still and pehabe yourself, or I'll rap you again mid me vist."|0|21|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor

"Te angel ab not te wing, and I am te Angel ov te Odd""."|2|21|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""My pizzness""!"|0|23|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"ejaculated the thing, ""vy vot a low bred puppy you mos pe vor to ask a gentleman und an angel apout his pizzness""!"|1|23|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
This language was rather more than I could bear, even from an angel; so, plucking up courage, I seized a salt-cellar which lay within reach, and hurled it at the head of the intruder.|0|24|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Either he dodged, however, or my aim was inaccurate; for all I accomplished was the demolition of the crystal which protected the dial of the clock upon the mantelpiece.|1|24|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
As for the Angel, he evinced his sense of my assault by giving me two or three hard consecutive raps upon the forehead as before.|2|24|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
These reduced me at once to submission, and I am almost ashamed to confess that, either through pain or vexation, there came a few tears into my eyes.|3|24|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""Mein Gott""!"|0|25|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"said the Angel of the Odd, apparently much softened at my distress; ""mein Gott, te man is eder ferry dronck or ferry sorry."|1|25|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
You mos not trink it so strong;you mos put de water in te wine.|2|25|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"Here, trink dis, like a goot veller, und don't gry now;don't""!"|3|25|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Hereupon the Angel of the Odd replenished my goblet (which was about a third full of Port) with a colorless fluid that he poured from one of his hand bottles.|0|26|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"I observed that these bottles had labels about their necks, and that these labels were inscribed ""Kirschenwasser""."|1|26|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
The considerate kindness of the Angel mollified me in no little measure; and, aided by the water with which he diluted my Port more than once, I at length regained sufficient temper to listen to his very extraordinary discourse.|0|27|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
I cannot pretend to recount all that he told me, but I gleaned from what he said that he was the genius who presided over the contre temps of mankind, and whose business it was to bring about the odd accidents which are continually astonishing the skeptic.|1|27|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Once or twice, upon my venturing to express my total incredulity in respect to his pretensions, he grew very angry indeed, so that at length I considered it the wiser policy to say nothing at all, and let him have his own way.|2|27|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
He talked on, therefore, at great length, while I merely leaned back in my chair with my eyes shut, and amused myself with munching raisins and flipping the stems about the room.|3|27|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
But, by and bye, the Angel suddenly construed this behavior of mine into contempt.|4|27|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"He arose in a terrible passion, slouched his funnel down over his eyes, swore a vast oath, uttered a threat of some character which I did not precisely comprehend, and finally made me a low bow and departed, wishing me, in the language of the archbishop in Gil-Blas, ""beaucoup de bonheur et un peu plus de bon sens""."|5|27|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
His departure afforded me relief.|0|28|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
The very few glasses of Lafitte that I had sipped had the effect of rendering me drowsy, and I felt inclined to take a nap of some fifteen or twenty minutes, as is my custom after dinner.|1|28|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
At six I had an appointment of consequence, which it was quite indispensable that I should keep.|2|28|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
The policy of insurance for my dwelling house had expired the day before; and, some dispute having arisen, it was agreed that, at six, I should meet the board of directors of the company and settle the terms of a renewal.|3|28|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Glancing upward at the clock on the mantel-piece (for I felt too drowsy to take out my watch), I had the pleasure to find that I had still twenty-five minutes to spare.|4|28|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
It was half past five; I could easily walk to the insurance office in five minutes; and my usual post prandian siestas had never been known to exceed five and twenty.|5|28|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
I felt sufficiently safe, therefore, and composed myself to my slumbers forthwith.|6|28|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Having completed them to my satisfaction, I again looked toward the time-piece, and was half inclined to believe in the possibility of odd accidents when I found that, instead of my ordinary fifteen or twenty minutes, I had been dozing only three; for it still wanted seven and twenty of the appointed hour.|0|29|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
I betook myself again to my nap, and at length a second time awoke, when, to my utter amazement, it still wanted twenty-seven minutes of six.|1|29|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
I jumped up to examine the clock, and found that it had ceased running.|2|29|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"My watch informed me that it was half past seven; and, of course, having slept two hours, I was too late for my appointment ""It will make no difference,"" I said; ""I can call at the office in the morning and apologize; in the meantime what can be the matter with the clock""?"|3|29|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Upon examining it I discovered that one of the raisin-stems which I had been flipping about the room during the discourse of the Angel of the Odd had flown through the fractured crystal, and lodging, singularly enough, in the key-hole, with an end projecting outward, had thus arrested the revolution of the minute-hand.|4|29|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""Ah""!"|0|30|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"said I; ""I see how it is."|1|30|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
This thing speaks for itself.|2|30|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"A natural accident, such as will happen now and then""!"|3|30|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
I gave the matter no further consideration, and at my usual hour retired to bed.|0|31|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"Here, having placed a candle upon a reading-stand at the bed-head, and having made an attempt to peruse some pages of the ""Omnipresence of the Deity,"" I unfortunately fell asleep in less than twenty seconds, leaving the light burning as it was."|1|31|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
My dreams were terrifically disturbed by visions of the Angel of the Odd.|0|32|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Methought he stood at the foot of the couch, drew aside the curtains, and, in the hollow, detestable tones of a rum-puncheon, menaced me with the bitterest vengeance for the contempt with which I had treated him.|1|32|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
He concluded a long harrangue by taking off his funnelcap, inserting the tube into my gullet, and thus deluging me with an ocean of Kirschenwasser, which he poured, in a continuous flood, from one of the long-necked bottles that stood him instead of an arm.|2|32|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
My agony was at length insufferable, and I awoke just in time to perceive that a rat had ran off with the lighted candle from the stand, but not in season to prevent his making his escape with it through the hole.|3|32|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Very soon, a strong suffocating odor assailed my nostrils; the house, I clearly perceived, was on fire.|4|32|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
In a few minutes the blaze broke forth with violence, and in an incredibly brief period the entire building was wrapped in flames.|5|32|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
All egress from my chamber, except through a window, was cut off.|6|32|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
The crowd, however, quickly procured and raised a long ladder.|7|32|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
By means of this I was descending rapidly, and in apparent safety, when a huge hog, about whose rotund stomach, and indeed about whose whole air and physiognomy, there was something which reminded me of the Angel of the Odd,;when this hog, I say, which hitherto had been quietly slumbering in the mud, took it suddenly into his head that his left shoulder needed scratching, and could find no more convenient rubbing post than that afforded by the foot of the ladder.|8|32|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
In an instant I was precipitated, and had the misfortune to fracture my arm.|9|32|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
This accident, with the loss of my insurance, and with the more serious loss of my hair, the whole of which had been singed off by the fire, predisposed me to serious impressions, so that, finally, I made up my mind to take a wife.|0|33|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
There was a rich widow disconsolate for the loss of her seventh husband, and to her wounded spirit I offered the balm of my vows.|1|33|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
She yielded a reluctant consent to my prayers.|2|33|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
I knelt at her feet in gratitude and adoration.|3|33|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
She blushed, and bowed her luxuriant tresse into close contact with those supplied me, temporarily, by Grandjean.|4|33|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
I know not how the entanglement took place, but so it was.|5|33|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
I arose with a shining pate, wigless, she in disdain and wrath, half buried in alien hair.|6|33|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Thus ended my hopes of the widow by an accident which could not have been anticipated, to be sure, but which the natural sequence of events had brought about.|7|33|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Without despairing, however, I undertook the siege of a less implacable heart.|0|34|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
The fates were again propitious for a brief period; but again a trivial incident interfered.|1|34|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Meeting my betrothed in an avenue thronged with the elite of the city, I was hastening to greet her with one of my best considered bows, when a small particle of some foreign matter lodging in the corner of my eye, rendered me, for the moment, completely blind.|2|34|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Before I could recover my sight, the lady of my love had disappeared;irreparably affronted at what she chose to consider my premeditated rudeness in passing her by ungreeted.|3|34|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
While I stood bewildered at the suddenness of this accident (which might have happened, nevertheless, to any one under the sun), and while I still continued incapable of sight, I was accosted by the Angel of the Odd, who proffered me his aid with a civility which I had no reason to expect.|4|34|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"He examined my disordered eye with much gentleness and skill, informed me that I had a drop in it, and (whatever a ""drop"" was) took it out, and afforded me relief."|5|34|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
I now considered it time to die, (since fortune had so determined to persecute me,) and accordingly made my way to the nearest river.|0|35|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Here, divesting myself of my clothes, (for there is no reason why we cannot die as we were born,) I threw myself headlong into the current; the sole witness of my fate being a solitary crow that had been seduced into the eating of brandy-saturated corn, and so had staggered away from his fellows.|1|35|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
No sooner had I entered the water than this bird took it into its head to fly away with the most indispensable portion of my apparel.|2|35|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Postponing, therefore, for the present, my suicidal design, I just slipped my nether extremities into the sleeves of my coat, and betook myself to a pursuit of the felon with all the nimbleness which the case required and its circumstances would admit.|3|35|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
But my evil destiny attended me still.|4|35|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
As I ran at full speed, with my nose up in the atmosphere, and intent only upon the purloiner of my property, I suddenly perceived that my feet rested no longer upon terre firma; the fact is, I had thrown myself over a precipice, and should inevitably have been dashed to pieces, but for my good fortune in grasping the end of a long guide-rope, which descended from a passing balloon.|5|35|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
As soon as I sufficiently recovered my senses to comprehend the terrific predicament in which I stood or rather hung, I exerted all the power of my lungs to make that predicament known to the aeronaut overhead.|0|36|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
But for a long time I exerted myself in vain.|1|36|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Either the fool could not, or the villain would not perceive me.|2|36|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Meantime the machine rapidly soared, while my strength even more rapidly failed.|3|36|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
I was soon upon the point of resigning myself to my fate, and dropping quietly into the sea, when my spirits were suddenly revived by hearing a hollow voice from above, which seemed to be lazily humming an opera air.|4|36|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Looking up, I perceived the Angel of the Odd.|5|36|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
He was leaning with his arms folded, over the rim of the car, and with a pipe in his mouth, at which he puffed leisurely, seemed to be upon excellent terms with himself and the universe.|6|36|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
I was too much exhausted to speak, so I merely regarded him with an imploring air.|7|36|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
For several minutes, although he looked me full in the face, he said nothing.|0|37|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
At length removing carefully his meerschaum from the right to the left corner of his mouth, he condescended to speak.|1|37|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""Who pe you""?"|0|38|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"he asked, ""und what der teuffel you pe do dare""?"|1|38|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"To this piece of impudence, cruelty, and affectation, I could reply only by ejaculating the monosyllable ""Help""!"|0|39|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""Elp""!"|0|40|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"echoed the ruffian;""not I. Dare iz te pottle;elp yourself, und pe tam'd""!"|1|40|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
With these words he let fall a heavy bottle of Kirschenwasser which, dropping precisely upon the crown of my head, caused me to imagine that my brains were entirely knocked out.|0|41|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Impressed with this idea, I was about to relinquish my hold and give up the ghost with a good grace, when I was arrested by the cry of the Angel, who bade me hold on.|1|41|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""Old on""!"|0|42|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"he said; ""don't pe in te urry;don't."|1|42|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"Will you pe take de odder pottle, or ave you pe got zober yet and come to your zenzes""?"|2|42|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
I made haste, hereupon, to nod my head twice;once in the negative, meaning thereby that I would prefer not taking the other bottle at present;and once in the affirmative, intending thus to imply that I was sober and had positively come to my senses.|0|43|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
By these means I somewhat softened the Angel.|1|43|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""Und you pelief, ten,"" he inquired, ""at te last?"|0|44|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"You pelief, ten, in te possibilty of te odd""?"|1|44|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
I again nodded my head in assent.|0|45|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""Und you ave pelief in me, te Angel of te Odd""?"|0|46|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
I nodded again.|0|47|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""Und you acknowledge tat you pe te blind dronk and te vool""?"|0|48|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
I nodded once more.|0|49|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""Put your right hand into your left hand preeches pocket, ten, in token oy your vull zubmission unto te Angel ov te Odd""."|0|50|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
This thing, for very obvious reasons, I found it quite impossible to do.|0|51|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
In the first place, my left arm had been broken in my fall from the ladder, and, therefore, had I let go my hold with the right hand, I must have let go altogether.|1|51|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
In the second place, I could have no breeches until I came across the crow.|2|51|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
I was therefore obliged, much to my regret, to shake my head in the negative;intending thus to give the Angel to understand that I found it inconvenient, just at that moment, to comply with his very reasonable demand!|3|51|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
"""Go to der teuffel ten""!"|0|52|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
roared the Angel of the Odd.|1|52|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
In pronouncing these words, he drew a sharp knife across the guide.|0|53|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
rope by which I was suspended, and as we then happened to be precisely over my own house, (which, during my peregrinations, had been handsomely rebuilt,) it so occurred that I tumbled headlong down the ample chimney and alit upon the dining-room hearth.|1|53|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Upon coming to my senses, (for the fall had very thoroughly stunned me,) I found it about four o'clock in the morning.|0|54|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
I lay outstretched where I had fAllan from the balloon.|1|54|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
My head grovelled in the ashes of an extinguished fire, while my feet reposed upon the wreck of a small table, overthrown, and amid the fragments of a miscellaneous dessert, intermingled with a newspaper, some broken glass and shattered bottles, and an empty jug of the Schiedam Kirschenwasser.|2|54|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
Thus revenged himself the Angel of the Odd.|3|54|The Angel Of The Odd|October 1844|Humor
I WILL now play the Oedipus to the Rattleborough enigma.|0|0|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
I will expound to you–as I alone can–the secret of the enginery that effected the Rattleborough miracle–the one, the true, the admitted, the undisputed, the indisputable miracle, which put a definite end to infidelity among the Rattleburghers and converted to the orthodoxy of the grandames all the carnal-minded who had ventured to be sceptical before.|1|0|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
This event–which I should be sorry to discuss in a tone of unsuitable levity–occurred in the summer of 18-.|0|1|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Mr. Barnabas Shuttleworthy–one of the wealthiest and most respectable citizens of the borough–had been missing for several days under circumstances which gave rise to suspicion of foul play.|1|1|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Mr. Shuttleworthy had set out from Rattleborough very early one Saturday morning, on horseback, with the avowed intention of proceeding to the city of-, about fifteen miles distant, and of returning the night of the same day.|2|1|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Two hours after his departure, however, his horse returned without him, and without the saddle-bags which had been strapped on his back at starting.|3|1|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
The animal was wounded, too, and covered with mud.|4|1|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
These circumstances naturally gave rise to much alarm among the friends of the missing man; and when it was found, on Sunday morning, that he had not yet made his appearance, the whole borough arose en masse to go and look for his body.|5|1|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"The foremost and most energetic in instituting this search was the bosom friend of Mr. Shuttleworthy–a Mr. Charles Goodfellow, or, as he was universally called, ""Charley Goodfellow,"" or ""Old Charley Goodfellow""."|0|2|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"Now, whether it is a marvellous coincidence, or whether it is that the name itself has an imperceptible effect upon the character, I have never yet been able to ascertain; but the fact is unquestionable, that there never yet was any person named Charles who was not an open, manly, honest, good-natured, and frank-hearted fellow, with a rich, clear voice, that did you good to hear it, and an eye that looked you always straight in the face, as much as to say: ""I have a clear conscience myself, am afraid of no man, and am altogether above doing a mean action""."|1|2|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"And thus all the hearty, careless, ""walking gentlemen"" of the stage are very certain to be called Charles."|2|2|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"Now, ""Old Charley Goodfellow,"" although he had been in Rattleborough not longer than six months or thereabouts, and although nobody knew any thing about him before he came to settle in the neighborhood, had experienced no difficulty in the world in making the acquaintance of all the respectable people in the borough."|0|3|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Not a man of them but would have taken his bare word for a thousand at any moment; and as for the women, there is no saying what they would not have done to oblige him.|1|3|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"And all this came of his having been christened Charles, and of his possessing, in consequence, that ingenuous face which is proverbially the very ""best letter of recommendation""."|2|3|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"I have already said that Mr. Shuttleworthy was one of the most respectable and, undoubtedly, he was the most wealthy man in Rattleborough, while ""Old Charley Goodfellow"" was upon as intimate terms with him as if he had been his own brother."|0|4|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"The two old gentlemen were next-door neighbours, and, although Mr. Shuttleworthy seldom, if ever, visited ""Old Charley,"" and never was known to take a meal in his house, still this did not prevent the two friends from being exceedingly intimate, as I have just observed; for ""Old Charley"" never let a day pass without stepping in three or four times to see how his neighbour came on, and very often he would stay to breakfast or tea, and almost always to dinner, and then the amount of wine that was made way with by the two cronies at a sitting, it would really be a difficult thing to ascertain."|1|4|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"""Old Charleys"" favorite beverage was Chateau-Margaux, and it appeared to do Mr. Shuttleworthy's heart good to see the old fellow swallow it, as he did, quart after quart; so that, one day, when the wine was in and the wit as a natural consequence, somewhat out, he said to his crony, as he slapped him upon the back–""I tell you what it is, 'Old Charley,' you are, by all odds, the heartiest old fellow I ever came across in all my born days; and, since you love to guzzle the wine at that fashion, I'll be darned if I don't have to make thee a present of a big box of the Chateau-Margaux."|2|4|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"Od rot me,""–(Mr. Shuttleworthy had a sad habit of swearing, although he seldom went beyond ""Od rot me,"" or ""By gosh,"" or ""By the jolly golly,"")–""Od rot me,"" says he, ""if I don't send an order to town this very afternoon for a double box of the best that can be got, and I'll make ye a present of it, I will!"|3|4|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"- ye needn't say a word now–I will, I tell ye, and there's an end of it; so look out for it–it will come to hand some of these fine days, precisely when ye are looking for it the least""!"|4|4|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
I mention this little bit of liberality on the part of Mr. Shuttleworthy, just by way of showing you how very intimate an understanding existed between the two friends.|5|4|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"Well, on the Sunday morning in question, when it came to be fairly understood that Mr. Shuttleworthy had met with foul play, I never saw any one so profoundly affected as ""Old Charley Goodfellow""."|0|5|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
When he first heard that the horse had come home without his master, and without his master's saddle-bags, and all bloody from a pistol-shot, that had gone clean through and through the poor animal's chest without quite killing him; when he heard all this, he turned as pale as if the missing man had been his own dear brother or father, and shivered and shook all over as if he had had a fit of the ague.|1|5|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
At first he was too much overpowered with grief to be able to do any thing at all, or to concert upon any plan of action; so that for a long time he endeavoured to dissuade Mr. Shuttleworthy's other friends from making a stir about the matter, thinking it best to wait awhile–say for a week or two, or a month, or two–to see if something wouldn't turn up, or if Mr. Shuttleworthy wouldn't come in the natural way, and explain his reasons for sending his horse on before.|0|6|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
I dare say you have often observed this disposition to temporize, or to procrastinate, in people who are labouring under any very poignant sorrow.|1|6|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"Their powers of mind seem to be rendered torpid, so that they have a horror of any thing like action, and like nothing in the world so well as to lie quietly in bed and ""nurse their grief,"" as the old ladies express it–that is to say, ruminate over the trouble."|2|6|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"The people of Rattleborough had, indeed, so high an opinion of the wisdom and discretion of ""Old Charley,"" that the greater part of them felt disposed to agree with him, and not make a stir in the business ""until something should turn up,"" as the honest old gentleman worded it; and I believe that, after all this would have been the general determination, but for the very suspicious interference of Mr. Shuttleworthy's nephew, a young man of very dissipated habits, and otherwise of rather bad character."|0|7|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"This nephew, whose name was Pennifeather, would listen to nothing like reason in the matter of ""lying quiet,"" but insisted upon making immediate search for the ""corpse of the murdered man."|1|7|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"–This was the expression he employed; and Mr. Goodfellow acutely remarked at the time, that it was ""a singular expression, to say no more""."|2|7|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"This remark of 'Old Charley's,' too, had great effect upon the crowd; and one of the party was heard to ask, very impressively, ""how it happened that young Mr. Pennifeather was so intimately cognizant of all the circumstances connected with his wealthy uncle's disappearance, as to feel authorized to assert, distinctly and unequivocally, that his uncle was 'a murdered man."|3|7|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"'"" Hereupon some little squibbing and bickering occurred among various members of the crowd, and especially between ""Old Charley"" and Mr. Pennifeather–although this latter occurrence was, indeed, by no means a novelty, for no good will had subsisted between the parties for the last three or four months; and matters had even gone so far that Mr. Pennifeather had actually knocked down his uncles friend for some alleged excess of liberty that the latter had taken in the uncle's house, of which the nephew was an inmate."|4|7|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"Upon this occasion ""Old Charley"" is said to have behaved with exemplary moderation and Christian charity."|5|7|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"He arose from the blow, adjusted his clothes, and made no attempt at retaliation at all–merely muttering a few words about ""taking summary vengeance at the first convenient opportunity,""- a natural and very justifiable ebullition of anger, which meant nothing, however, and, beyond doubt, was no sooner given vent to than forgotten."|6|7|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
However these matters may be (which have no reference to the point now at issue), it is quite certain that the people of Rattleborough, principally through the persuasion of Mr. Pennifeather, came at length to the determination of dispersion over the adjacent country in search of the missing Mr. Shuttleworthy.|0|8|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
I say they came to this determination in the first instance.|1|8|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
After it had been fully resolved that a search should be made, it was considered almost a matter of course that the seekers should disperse–that is to say, distribute themselves in parties–for the more thorough examination of the region round about.|2|8|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"I forget, however, by what ingenious train of reasoning it was that ""Old Charley"" finally convinced the assembly that this was the most injudicious plan that could be pursued."|3|8|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"Convince them, however, he did–all except Mr. Pennifeather, and, in the end, it was arranged that a search should be instituted, carefully and very thoroughly, by the burghers en masse, ""Old Charley"" himself leading the way."|4|8|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"As for the matter of that, there could have been no better pioneer than ""Old Charley,"" whom everybody knew to have the eye of a lynx; but, although he led them into all manner of out-of-the-way holes and corners, by routes that nobody had ever suspected of existing in the neighbourhood, and although the search was incessantly kept up day and night for nearly a week, still no trace of Mr. Shuttleworthy could be discovered."|0|9|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
When I say no trace, however, I must not be understood to speak literally, for trace, to some extent, there certainly was.|1|9|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
The poor gentleman had been tracked, by his horses shoes (which were peculiar), to a spot about three miles to the east of the borough, on the main road leading to the city.|2|9|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Here the track made off into a by-path through a piece of woodland–the path coming out again into the main road, and cutting off about half a mile of the regular distance.|3|9|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Following the shoe-marks down this lane, the party came at length to a pool of stagnant water, half hidden by the brambles, to the right of the lane, and opposite this pool all vestige of the track was lost sight of.|4|9|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
It appeared, however, that a struggle of some nature had here taken place, and it seemed as if some large and heavy body, much larger and heavier than a man, had been drawn from the by-path to the pool.|5|9|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
This latter was carefully dragged twice, but nothing was found; and the party was upon the point of going away, in despair of coming to any result, when Providence suggested to Mr. Goodfellow the expediency of draining the water off altogether.|6|9|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"This project was received with cheers, and many high compliments to ""Old Charley"" upon his sagacity and consideration."|7|9|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
As many of the burghers had brought spades with them, supposing that they might possibly be called upon to disinter a corpse, the drain was easily and speedily effected; and no sooner was the bottom visible, than right in the middle of the mud that remained was discovered a black silk velvet waistcoat, which nearly every one present immediately recognized as the property of Mr. Pennifeather.|8|9|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
This waistcoat was much torn and stained with blood, and there were several persons among the party who had a distinct remembrance of its having been worn by its owner on the very morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy's departure for the city; while there were others, again, ready to testify upon oath, if required, that Mr. P. did not wear the garment in question at any period during the remainder of that memorable day, nor could any one be found to say that he had seen it upon Mr. P.'s person at any period at all subsequent to Mr. Shuttleworthy's disappearance.|9|9|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Matters now wore a very serious aspect for Mr. Pennifeather, and it was observed, as an indubitable confirmation of the suspicions which were excited against him, that he grew exceedingly pale, and when asked what he had to say for himself, was utterly incapable of saying a word.|0|10|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Hereupon, the few friends his riotous mode of living had left him, deserted him at once to a man, and were even more clamorous than his ancient and avowed enemies for his instantaneous arrest.|1|10|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
But, on the other hand, the magnanimity of Mr. Goodfellow shone forth with only the more brilliant lustre through contrast.|2|10|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"He made a warm and intensely eloquent defence of Mr. Pennifeather, in which he alluded more than once to his own sincere forgiveness of that wild young gentleman–""the heir of the worthy Mr. Shuttleworthy,""–for the insult which he (the young gentleman) had, no doubt in the heat of passion, thought proper to put upon him (Mr. Goodfellow)."|3|10|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"""He forgave him for it,"" he said, ""from the very bottom of his heart; and for himself (Mr. Goodfellow), so far from pushing the suspicious circumstances to extremity, which he was sorry to say, really had arisen against Mr. Pennifeather, he (Mr. Goodfellow) would make every exertion in his power, would employ all the little eloquence in his possession to–to–to–soften down, as much as he could conscientiously do so, the worst features of this really exceedingly perplexing piece of business""."|4|10|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Mr. Goodfellow went on for some half hour longer in this strain, very much to the credit both of his head and of his heart; but your warm-hearted people are seldom apposite in their observations–they run into all sorts of blunders, contre-temps and mal apropos-isms, in the hot-headedness of their zeal to serve a friend–thus, often with the kindest intentions in the world, doing infinitely more to prejudice his cause than to advance it.|0|11|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"So, in the present instance, it turned out with all the eloquence of ""Old Charley""; for, although he laboured earnestly in behalf of the suspected, yet it so happened, somehow or other, that every syllable he uttered of which the direct but unwitting tendency was not to exalt the speaker in the good opinion of his audience, had the effect to deepen the suspicion already attached to the individual whose cause he pleaded, and to arouse against him the fury of the mob."|0|12|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"One of the most unaccountable errors committed by the orator was his allusion to the suspected as ""the heir of the worthy old gentleman Mr. Shuttleworthy""."|0|13|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
The people had really never thought of this before.|1|13|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"They had only remembered certain threats of disinheritance uttered a year or two previously by the uncle (who had no living relative except the nephew), and they had, therefore, always looked upon this disinheritance as a matter that was settled–so single-minded a race of beings were the Rattleburghers; but the remark of ""Old Charley"" brought them at once to a consideration of this point, and thus gave them to see the possibility of the threats having been nothing more than a threat."|2|13|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
And straightway hereupon, arose the natural question of cui bono?|3|13|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
–a question that tended even more than the waistcoat to fasten the terrible crime upon the young man.|4|13|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
And here, lest I may be misunderstood, permit me to digress for one moment merely to observe that the exceedingly brief and simple Latin phrase which I have employed, is invariably mistranslated and misconceived.|5|13|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"""Cui bono""?"|6|13|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"in all the crack novels and elsewhere,–in those of Mrs. Gore, for example, (the author of ""Cecil,"") a lady who quotes all tongues from the Chaldaean to Chickasaw, and is helped to her learning, ""as needed,"" upon a systematic plan, by Mr. Beckford,–in all the crack novels, I say, from those of Bulwer and Dickens to those of Bulwer and Dickens to those of Turnapenny and Ainsworth, the two little Latin words cui bono are rendered ""to what purpose""?"|7|13|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"or, (as if quo bono,) ""to what good""."|8|13|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"Their true meaning, nevertheless, is ""for whose advantage""."|9|13|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Cui, to whom; bono, is it for a benefit.|10|13|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
It is a purely legal phrase, and applicable precisely in cases such as we have now under consideration, where the probability of the doer of a deed hinges upon the probability of the benefit accruing to this individual or to that from the deed's accomplishment.|11|13|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Now in the present instance, the question cui bono?|12|13|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
very pointedly implicated Mr. Pennifeather.|13|13|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
His uncle had threatened him, after making a will in his favour, with disinheritance.|14|13|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
But the threat had not been actually kept; the original will, it appeared, had not been altered.|15|13|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Had it been altered, the only supposable motive for murder on the part of the suspected would have been the ordinary one of revenge; and even this would have been counteracted by the hope of reinstation into the good graces of the uncle.|16|13|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
But the will being unaltered, while the threat to alter remained suspended over the nephew's head, there appears at once the very strongest possible inducement for the atrocity, and so concluded, very sagaciously, the worthy citizens of the borough of Rattle.|17|13|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Mr. Pennifeather was, accordingly, arrested upon the spot, and the crowd, after some further search, proceeded homeward, having him in custody.|0|14|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
On the route, however, another circumstance occurred tending to confirm the suspicion entertained.|1|14|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Mr. Goodfellow, whose zeal led him to be always a little in advance of the party, was seen suddenly to run forward a few paces, stoop, and then apparently to pick up some small object from the grass.|2|14|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Having quickly examined it he was observed, too, to make a sort of half attempt at concealing it in his coat pocket; but this action was noticed, as I say, and consequently prevented, when the object picked up was found to be a Spanish knife which a dozen persons at once recognized as belonging to Mr. Pennifeather.|3|14|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Moreover, his initials were engraved upon the handle.|4|14|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
The blade of this knife was open and bloody.|5|14|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
No doubt now remained of the guilt of the nephew, and immediately upon reaching Rattleborough he was taken before a magistrate for examination.|0|15|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Here matters again took a most unfavourable turn.|0|16|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
The prisoner, being questioned as to his whereabouts on the morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy's disappearance, had absolutely the audacity to acknowledge that on that very morning he had been out with his rifle deer-stalking, in the immediate neighbourhood of the pool where the blood-stained waistcoat had been discovered through the sagacity of Mr. Goodfellow.|1|16|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
This latter now came forward, and, with tears in his eyes, asked permission to be examined.|0|17|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
He said that a stern sense of the duty he owed his Maker, not less than his fellow-men, would permit him no longer to remain silent.|1|17|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Hitherto, the sincerest affection for the young man (notwithstanding the latter's ill-treatment of himself, Mr. Goodfellow) had induced him to make every hypothesis which imagination could suggest, by way of endeavouring to account for what appeared suspicious in the circumstances that told so seriously against Mr. Pennifeather, but these circumstances were now altogether too convincing–too damning, he would hesitate no longer- he would tell all he knew, although his heart (Mr. Goodfellow's) should absolutely burst asunder in the effort.|2|17|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"He then went on to state that, on the afternoon of the day previous to Mr. Shuttleworthy's departure for the city, that worthy old gentleman had mentioned to his nephew, in his hearing (Mr. Goodfellow's), that his object in going to town on the morrow was to make a deposit of an unusually large sum of money in the ""Farmers and Mechanics' Bank,"" and that, then and there, the said Mr. Shuttleworthy had distinctly avowed to the said nephew his irrevocable determination of rescinding the will originally made, and of cutting him off with a shilling."|3|17|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
He (the witness) now solemnly called upon the accused to state whether what he (the witness) had just stated was or was not the truth in every substantial particular.|4|17|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Much to the astonishment of every one present, Mr. Pennifeather frankly admitted that it was.|5|17|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
The magistrate now considered it his duty to send a couple of constables to search the chamber of the accused in the house of his uncle.|0|18|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
From this search they almost immediately returned with the well-known steel-bound, russet leather pocket-book which the old gentleman had been in the habit of carrying for years.|1|18|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Its valuable contents, however, had been abstracted, and the magistrate in vain endeavoured to extort from the prisoner the use which had been made of them, or the place of their concealment.|2|18|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Indeed, he obstinately denied all knowledge of the matter.|3|18|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
The constables, also, discovered, between the bed and sacking of the unhappy man, a shirt and neck-handkerchief both marked with the initials of his name, and both hideously besmeared with the blood of the victim.|4|18|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
At this juncture, it was announced that the horse of the murdered man had just expired in the stable from the effects of the wound he had received, and it was proposed by Mr. Goodfellow that a post mortem examination of the beast should be immediately made, with the view, if possible, of discovering the ball.|0|19|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
This was accordingly done; and, as if to demonstrate beyond a question the guilt of the accused, Mr. Goodfellow, after considerable searching in the cavity of the chest was enabled to detect and to pull forth a bullet of very extraordinary size, which, upon trial, was found to be exactly adapted to the bore of Mr. Pennifeather's rifle, while it was far too large for that of any other person in the borough or its vicinity.|1|19|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
To render the matter even surer yet, however, this bullet was discovered to have a flaw or seam at right angles to the usual suture, and upon examination, this seam corresponded precisely with an accidental ridge or elevation in a pair of moulds acknowledged by the accused himself to be his own property.|2|19|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Upon finding of this bullet, the examining magistrate refused to listen to any farther testimony, and immediately committed the prisoner for trial-declining resolutely to take any bail in the case, although against this severity Mr. Goodfellow very warmly remonstrated, and offered to become surety in whatever amount might be required.|3|19|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"This generosity on the part of ""Old Charley"" was only in accordance with the whole tenour of his amiable and chivalrous conduct during the entire period of his sojourn in the borough of Rattle."|4|19|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
In the present instance the worthy man was so entirely carried away by the excessive warmth of his sympathy, that he seemed to have quite forgotten, when he offered to go bail for his young friend, that he himself (Mr. Goodfellow) did not possess a single dollar's worth of property upon the face of the earth.|5|19|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
The result of the committal may be readily foreseen.|0|20|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"Mr. Pennifeather, amid the loud execrations of all Rattleborough, was brought to trial at the next criminal sessions, when the chain of circumstantial evidence (strengthened as it was by some additional damning facts, which Mr. Goodfellow's sensitive conscientiousness forbade him to withhold from the court) was considered so unbroken and so thoroughly conclusive, that the jury, without leaving their seats, returned an immediate verdict of ""Guilty of murder in the first degree""."|1|20|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Soon afterward the unhappy wretch received sentence of death, and was remanded to the county jail to await the inexorable vengeance of the law.|2|20|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"In the meantime, the noble behaviour of ""Old Charley Goodfellow, had doubly endeared him to the honest citizens of the borough."|0|21|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
He became ten times a greater favorite than ever, and, as a natural result of the hospitality with which he was treated, he relaxed, as it were, perforce, the extremely parsimonious habits which his poverty had hitherto impelled him to observe, and very frequently had little reunions at his own house, when wit and jollity reigned supreme-dampened a little, of course, by the occasional remembrance of the untoward and melancholy fate which impended over the nephew of the late lamented bosom friend of the generous host.|1|21|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire

The fact is, that Mr. Goodfellow had, since the death of Mr. Shuttleworthy, given over all expectation of ever receiving the promised Chateau-Margaux; and he, therefore, looked upon it now as a sort of especial dispensation of Providence in his behalf.|0|35|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
He was highly delighted, of course, and in the exuberance of his joy invited a large party of friends to a petit souper on the morrow, for the purpose of broaching the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy's present.|1|35|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"Not that he said any thing about ""the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy"" when he issued the invitations."|2|35|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
The fact is, he thought much and concluded to say nothing at all.|3|35|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
He did not mention to any one–if I remember aright–that he had received a present of Chateau-Margaux.|4|35|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
He merely asked his friends to come and help him drink some, of a remarkable fine quality and rich flavour, that he had ordered up from the city a couple of months ago, and of which he would be in the receipt upon the morrow.|5|35|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"I have often puzzled myself to imagine why it was that ""Old Charley"" came to the conclusion to say nothing about having received the wine from his old friend, but I could never precisely understand his reason for the silence, although he had some excellent and very magnanimous reason, no doubt."|6|35|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
The morrow at length arrived, and with it a very large and highly respectable company at Mr. Goodfellow's house.|0|36|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"Indeed, half the borough was there,–I myself among the number,–but, much to the vexation of the host, the Chateau-Margaux did not arrive until a late hour, and when the sumptuous supper supplied by ""Old Charley"" had been done very ample justice by the guests."|1|36|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
It came at length, however,–a monstrously big box of it there was, too–and as the whole party were in excessively good humor, it was decided, nem.|2|36|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
con.|3|36|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
, that it should be lifted upon the table and its contents disembowelled forthwith.|4|36|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
No sooner said than done.|0|37|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
I lent a helping hand; and, in a trice we had the box upon the table, in the midst of all the bottles and glasses, not a few of which were demolished in the scuffle.|1|37|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"""Old Charley,"" who was pretty much intoxicated, and excessively red in the face, now took a seat, with an air of mock dignity, at the head of the board, and thumped furiously upon it with a decanter, calling upon the company to keep order ""during the ceremony of disinterring the treasure""."|2|37|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
After some vociferation, quiet was at length fully restored, and, as very often happens in similar cases, a profound and remarkable silence ensued.|0|38|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"Being then requested to force open the lid, I complied, of course, ""with an infinite deal of pleasure""."|1|38|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
I inserted a chisel, and giving it a few slight taps with a hammer, the top of the box flew suddenly off, and at the same instant, there sprang up into a sitting position, directly facing the host, the bruised, bloody, and nearly putrid corpse of the murdered Mr. Shuttleworthy himself.|2|38|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"It gazed for a few seconds, fixedly and sorrowfully, with its decaying and lack-lustre eyes, full into the countenance of Mr. Goodfellow; uttered slowly, but clearly and impressively, the words–""Thou art the man""!"|3|38|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
and then, falling over the side of the chest as if thoroughly satisfied, stretched out its limbs quiveringly upon the table.|4|38|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
The scene that ensued is altogether beyond description.|0|39|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
The rush for the doors and windows was terrific, and many of the most robust men in the room fainted outright through sheer horror.|1|39|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
But after the first wild, shrieking burst of affright, all eyes were directed to Mr. Goodfellow.|2|39|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
If I live a thousand years, I can never forget the more than mortal agony which was depicted in that ghastly face of his, so lately rubicund with triumph and wine.|3|39|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
For several minutes he sat rigidly as a statue of marble; his eyes seeming, in the intense vacancy of their gaze, to be turned inward and absorbed in the contemplation of his own miserable, murderous soul.|4|39|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
At length their expression appeared to flash suddenly out into the external world, when, with a quick leap, he sprang from his chair, and falling heavily with his head and shoulders upon the table, and in contact with the corpse, poured out rapidly and vehemently a detailed confession of the hideous crime for which Mr. Pennifeather was then imprisoned and doomed to die.|5|39|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
What he recounted was in substance this:–He followed his victim to the vicinity of the pool; there shot his horse with a pistol; despatched its rider with the butt end; possessed himself of the pocket-book, and, supposing the horse dead, dragged it with great labour to the brambles by the pond.|0|40|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Upon his own beast he slung the corpse of Mr. Shuttleworthy, and thus bore it to a secure place of concealment a long distance off through the woods.|1|40|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
The waistcoat, the knife, the pocket-book, and bullet, had been placed by himself where found, with the view of avenging himself upon Mr. Pennifeather.|0|41|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
He had also contrived the discovery of the stained handkerchief and shirt.|1|41|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Towards the end of the blood-churning recital the words of the guilty wretch faltered and grew hollow.|0|42|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
When the record was finally exhausted, he arose, staggered backward from the table, and fell-dead.|1|42|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
The means by which this happily-timed confession was extorted, although efficient, were simple indeed.|0|43|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Mr. Goodfellow's excess of frankness had disgusted me, and excited my suspicions from the first.|1|43|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
I was present when Mr. Pennifeather had struck him, and the fiendish expression which then arose upon his countenance, although momentary, assured me that his threat of vengeance would, if possible, be rigidly fulfilled.|2|43|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
"I was thus prepared to view the manoeuvering of ""Old Charley"" in a very different light from that in which it was regarded by the good citizens of Rattleborough."|3|43|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
I saw at once that all the criminating discoveries arose, either directly or indirectly, from himself.|4|43|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
But the fact which clearly opened my eyes to the true state of the case, was the affair of the bullet, found by Mr. G. in the carcass of the horse.|5|43|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
I had not forgotten, although the Rattleburghers had, that there was a hole where the ball had entered the horse, and another where it went out.|6|43|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
If it were found in the animal then, after having made its exit, I saw clearly that it must have been deposited by the person who found it.|7|43|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
The bloody shirt and handkerchief confirmed the idea suggested by the bullet; for the blood on examination proved to be capital claret, and no more.|8|43|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
When I came to think of these things, and also of the late increase of liberality and expenditure on the part of Mr. Goodfellow, I entertained a suspicion which was none the less strong because I kept it altogether to myself.|9|43|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
In the meantime, I instituted a rigorous private search for the corpse of Mr. Shuttleworthy, and, for good reasons, searched in quarters as divergent as possible from those to which Mr. Goodfellow conducted his party.|0|44|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
The result was that, after some days, I came across an old dry well, the mouth of which was nearly hidden by brambles; and here, at the bottom, I discovered what I sought.|1|44|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Now it so happened that I had overheard the colloquy between the two cronies, when Mr. Goodfellow had contrived to cajole his host into the promise of a box of Chateaux-Margaux.|0|45|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Upon this hint I acted.|1|45|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
I procured a stiff piece of whalebone, thrust it down the throat of the corpse, and deposited the latter in an old wine box-taking care so to double the body up as to double the whalebone with it.|2|45|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
In this manner I had to press forcibly upon the lid to keep it down while I secured it with nails; and I anticipated, of course, that as soon as these latter were removed, the top would fly off and the body up.|3|45|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Having thus arranged the box, I marked, numbered, and addressed it as already told; and then writing a letter in the name of the wine merchants with whom Mr. Shuttleworthy dealt, I gave instructions to my servant to wheel the box to Mr. Goodfellow's door, in a barrow, at a given signal from myself.|0|46|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
For the words which I intended the corpse to speak, I confidently depended upon my ventriloquial abilities; for their effect, I counted upon the conscience of the murderous wretch.|1|46|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
I believe there is nothing more to be explained.|0|47|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire
Mr. Pennifeather was released upon the spot, inherited the fortune of his uncle, profited by the lessons of experience, turned over a new leaf, and led happily ever afterward a new life.|1|47|Thou Art The Man|November 1844|Detective fiction / Satire

"My first moment of positive inspiration must be dated from that ever-memorable epoch, when the brilliant conductor of the ""Gad-Fly,"" in the intervals of the important process just mentioned, recited aloud, before a conclave of our apprentices, an inimitable poem in honor of the ""Only Genuine Oil-of-Bob"" (so called from its talented inventor, my father), and for which effusion the editor of the ""Fly"" was remunerated with a regal liberality by the firm of Thomas Bob &amp; Company, merchant-barbers."|5|1|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|December 1844|Humor

The result of this well-conceived plan, however, (the success of which would have saved me much trouble in after-life,) served to convince me that some editors are not to be bamboozled, and gave the coup-de-grace (as they say in France) to my nascent hopes (as they say in the city of the transcendentals).|1|8|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|December 1844|Humor

'Oppodeldoc' (whoever he is) has the audacity to demand of us, for his twattle, a 'speedy insertion and prompt pay.|3|10|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|December 1844|Humor
' We neither insert nor purchase any stuff of the sort.|4|10|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|December 1844|Humor

Accompanying the letter of 'Oppodeldoc' (whoever he is) we find sundry lines of most disgusting and unmeaning rant about 'angels and ministers of grace,'–rant such as no madman short of a Nat Lee, or an 'Oppodeldoc,' could possibly perpetrate.|1|13|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|December 1844|Humor

"Mr. Crab having now paused in his discourse (the latter portion of which I found it impossible to comprehend), I ventured to suggest something about the remuneration which I had been taught to expect for my poem, by an announcement on the cover of the ""Lollipop,"" declaring that it (the ""Lollipop"") ""insisted upon being permitted to pay exorbitant prices for all accepted contributions,–frequently expending more money for a single brief poem than the whole annual cost of the 'Hum-Drum,' the 'Rowdy-Dow,' and the 'Goosetherumfoodle' combined""."|0|39|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|December 1844|Humor
"As I mentioned the word ""remuneration,"" Mr. Crab first opened his eyes, and then his mouth, to quite a remarkable extent, causing his personal appearance to resemble that of a highly agitated elderly duck in the act of quacking; and in this condition he remained (ever and anon pressing his hinds tightly to his forehead, as if in a state of desperate bewilderment) until I had nearly made an end of what I had to say."|0|40|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|December 1844|Humor

Seneca.|1|0|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
AT Paris, just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18--, I was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum, in company with my friend C. Auguste Dupin, in his little back library, or book-closet, au troisieme, No.|0|1|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
33, Rue Dunot, Faubourg St. Germain.|1|1|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
For one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence; while each, to any casual observer, might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber.|2|1|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
For myself, however, I was mentally discussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and the mystery attending the murder of Marie Roget.|3|1|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
I looked upon it, therefore, as something of a coincidence, when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance, Monsieur G--, the Prefect of the Parisian police.|4|1|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we had not seen him for several years.|0|2|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
We had been sitting in the dark, and Dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but sat down again, without doing so, upon G.'s saying that he had called to consult us, or rather to ask the opinion of my friend, about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of trouble.|1|2|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""If it is any point requiring reflection,"" observed Dupin, as he forbore to enkindle the wick, ""we shall examine it to better purpose in the dark""."|0|3|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""That is another of your odd notions,"" said the Prefect, who had a fashion of calling every thing ""odd"" that was beyond his comprehension, and thus lived amid an absolute legion of ""oddities""."|0|4|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Very true,"" said Dupin, as he supplied his visitor with a pipe, and rolled towards him a comfortable chair."|0|5|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""And what is the difficulty now""?"|0|6|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
I asked.|1|6|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Nothing more in the assassination way, I hope""?"|2|6|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Oh no; nothing of that nature."|0|7|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"The fact is, the business is very simple indeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well ourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like to hear the details of it, because it is so excessively odd""."|1|7|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Simple and odd,"" said Dupin."|0|8|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Why, yes; and not exactly that, either."|0|9|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"The fact is, we have all been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple, and yet baffles us altogether""."|1|9|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault,"" said my friend."|0|10|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""What nonsense you do talk""!"|0|11|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
replied the Prefect, laughing heartily.|1|11|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Perhaps the mystery is a little too plain,"" said Dupin."|0|12|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Oh, good heavens!"|0|13|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"who ever heard of such an idea""?"|1|13|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""A little too self-evident""."|0|14|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Ha!"|0|15|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
ha!|1|15|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction

ho!|7|15|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"ho""!"|8|15|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"--roared our visitor, profoundly amused, ""oh, Dupin, you will be the death of me yet""!"|9|15|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""And what, after all, is the matter on hand""?"|0|16|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
I asked.|1|16|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Why, I will tell you,"" replied the Prefect, as he gave a long, steady, and contemplative puff, and settled himself in his chair."|0|17|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""I will tell you in a few words; but, before I begin, let me caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy, and that I should most probably lose the position I now hold, were it known that I confided it to any one."|1|17|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Or not,"" said Dupin."|0|19|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Well, then; I have received personal information, from a very high quarter, that a certain document of the last importance, has been purloined from the royal apartments."|0|20|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
The individual who purloined it is known; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it.|1|20|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"It is known, also, that it still remains in his possession""."|2|20|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""How is this known""?"|0|21|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
asked Dupin.|1|21|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""It is clearly inferred,"" replied the Prefect, ""from the nature of the document, and from the nonappearance of certain results which would at once arise from its passing out of the robber's possession; --that is to say, from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it""."|0|22|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Be a little more explicit,"" I said."|0|23|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Well, I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely valuable""."|0|24|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
The Prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy.|1|24|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Still I do not quite understand,"" said Dupin."|0|25|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""No?"|0|26|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"Well; the disclosure of the document to a third person, who shall be nameless, would bring in question the honor of a personage of most exalted station; and this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so jeopardized""."|1|26|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""But this ascendancy,"" I interposed, ""would depend upon the robber's knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber."|0|27|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""The thief,"" said G., is the Minister D--, who dares all things, those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man."|0|28|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
The method of the theft was not less ingenious than bold.|1|28|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
The document in question --a letter, to be frank --had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the royal boudoir.|2|28|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
During its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it.|3|28|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer, she was forced to place it, open as it was, upon a table.|4|28|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
The address, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed, the letter escaped notice.|5|28|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
At this juncture enters the Minister D--.|6|28|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
His lynx eye immediately perceives the paper, recognises the handwriting of the address, observes the confusion of the personage addressed, and fathoms her secret.|7|28|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
After some business transactions, hurried through in his ordinary manner, he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question, opens it, pretends to read it, and then places it in close juxtaposition to the other.|8|28|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
Again he converses, for some fifteen minutes, upon the public affairs.|9|28|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
At length, in taking leave, he takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim.|10|28|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
Its rightful owner saw, but, of course, dared not call attention to the act, in the presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow.|11|28|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"The minister decamped; leaving his own letter --one of no importance --upon the table""."|12|28|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Here, then,"" said Dupin to me, ""you have precisely what you demand to make the ascendancy complete --the robber's knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber""."|0|29|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Yes,"" replied the Prefect; ""and the power thus attained has, for some months past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very dangerous extent."|0|30|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
The personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced, every day, of the necessity of reclaiming her letter.|1|30|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
But this, of course, cannot be done openly.|2|30|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"In fine, driven to despair, she has committed the matter to me""."|3|30|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Than whom,"" said Dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, ""no more sagacious agent could, I suppose, be desired, or even imagined""."|0|31|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""You flatter me,"" replied the Prefect; ""but it is possible that some such opinion may have been entertained""."|0|32|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""It is clear,"" said I, ""as you observe, that the letter is still in possession of the minister; since it is this possession, and not any employment of the letter, which bestows the power."|0|33|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"With the employment the power departs""."|1|33|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""True,"" said G. ""and upon this conviction I proceeded."|0|34|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
My first care was to make thorough search of the minister's hotel; and here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge.|1|34|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"Beyond all things, I have been warned of the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect our design""."|2|34|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""But,"" said I, ""you are quite au fait in these investigations."|0|35|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"The Parisian police have done this thing often before""."|1|35|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Oh yes; and for this reason I did not despair."|0|36|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
The habits of the minister gave me, too, a great advantage.|1|36|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
He is frequently absent from home all night.|2|36|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
His servants are by no means numerous.|3|36|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
They sleep at a distance from their master's apartment, and, being chiefly Neapolitans, are readily made drunk.|4|36|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
I have keys, as you know, with which I can open any chamber or cabinet in Paris.|5|36|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
For three months a night has not passed, during the greater part of which I have not been engaged, personally, in ransacking the D-–Hotel.|6|36|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
My honor is interested, and, to mention a great secret, the reward is enormous.|7|36|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
So I did not abandon the search until I had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more astute man than myself.|8|36|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"I fancy that I have investigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed""."|9|36|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""But is it not possible,"" I suggested, ""that although the letter may be in possession of the minister, as it unquestionably is, he may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises""?"|0|37|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""This is barely possible,"" said Dupin."|0|38|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""The present peculiar condition of affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues in which D-–is known to be involved, would render the instant availability of the document --its susceptibility of being produced at a moment's notice --a point of nearly equal importance with its possession""."|1|38|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Its susceptibility of being produced""?"|0|39|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""That is to say, of being destroyed,"" said Dupin."|0|40|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""True,"" I observed; ""the paper is clearly then upon the premises."|0|41|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"As for its being upon the person of the minister, we may consider that as out of the question""."|1|41|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Entirely,"" said the Prefect."|0|42|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""He has been twice waylaid, as if by footpads, and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection."|1|42|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""You might have spared yourself this trouble,"" said Dupin."|0|43|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""D--, I presume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must have anticipated these waylayings, as a matter of course""."|1|43|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Not altogether a fool,"" said G., ""but then he's a poet, which I take to be only one remove from a fool""."|0|44|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""True,"" said Dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum, ""although I have been guilty of certain doggerel myself""."|0|45|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Suppose you detail,"" said I, ""the particulars of your search""."|0|46|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Why the fact is, we took our time, and we searched every where."|0|47|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
I have had long experience in these affairs.|1|47|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
I took the entire building, room by room; devoting the nights of a whole week to each.|2|47|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
We examined, first, the furniture of each apartment.|3|47|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
We opened every possible drawer; and I presume you know that, to a properly trained police agent, such a thing as a secret drawer is impossible.|4|47|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
Any man is a dolt who permits a 'secret' drawer to escape him in a search of this kind.|5|47|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
The thing is so plain.|6|47|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
There is a certain amount of bulk --of space --to be accounted for in every cabinet.|7|47|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
Then we have accurate rules.|8|47|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
The fiftieth part of a line could not escape us.|9|47|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
After the cabinets we took the chairs.|10|47|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
The cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ.|11|47|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"From the tables we removed the tops""."|12|47|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Why so""?"|0|48|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece of furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article; then the leg is excavated, the article deposited within the cavity, and the top replaced."|0|49|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"The bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same way""."|1|49|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""But could not the cavity be detected by sounding""?"|0|50|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
I asked.|1|50|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""By no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient wadding of cotton be placed around it."|0|51|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"Besides, in our case, we were obliged to proceed without noise""."|1|51|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""But you could not have removed --you could not have taken to pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention."|0|52|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
A letter may be compressed into a thin spiral roll, not differing much in shape or bulk from a large knitting-needle, and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of a chair, for example.|1|52|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"You did not take to pieces all the chairs""?"|2|52|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Certainly not; but we did better --we examined the rungs of every chair in the hotel, and, indeed, the jointings of every description of furniture, by the aid of a most powerful microscope."|0|53|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
Had there been any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it instantly.|1|53|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
A single grain of gimlet-dust, for example, would have been as obvious as an apple.|2|53|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"Any disorder in the glueing --any unusual gaping in the joints --would have sufficed to insure detection""."|3|53|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the plates, and you probed the beds and the bed-clothes, as well as the curtains and carpets""."|0|54|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""That of course; and when we had absolutely completed every particle of the furniture in this way, then we examined the house itself."|0|55|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"We divided its entire surface into compartments, which we numbered, so that none might be missed; then we scrutinized each individual square inch throughout the premises, including the two houses immediately adjoining, with the microscope, as before""."|1|55|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""The two houses adjoining""!"|0|56|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"I exclaimed; ""you must have had a great deal of trouble""."|1|56|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""We had; but the reward offered is prodigious."|0|57|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""You include the grounds about the houses""?"|0|58|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""All the grounds are paved with brick."|0|59|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
They gave us comparatively little trouble.|1|59|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"We examined the moss between the bricks, and found it undisturbed""."|2|59|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""You looked among D--'s papers, of course, and into the books of the library""?"|0|60|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only opened every book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume, not contenting ourselves with a mere shake, according to the fashion of some of our police officers."|0|61|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
We also measured the thickness of every book-cover, with the most accurate admeasurement, and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope.|1|61|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
Had any of the bindings been recently meddled with, it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have escaped observation.|2|61|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"Some five or six volumes, just from the hands of the binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally, with the needles""."|3|61|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""You explored the floors beneath the carpets""?"|0|62|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Beyond doubt."|0|63|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"We removed every carpet, and examined the boards with the microscope""."|1|63|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""And the paper on the walls""?"|0|64|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Yes."|0|65|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""You looked into the cellars""?"|0|66|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""We did""."|0|67|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Then,"" I said, ""you have been making a miscalculation, and the letter is not upon the premises, as you suppose."|0|68|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""I fear you are right there,"" said the Prefect."|0|69|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""And now, Dupin, what would you advise me to do""?"|1|69|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""To make a thorough re-search of the premises""."|0|70|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""That is absolutely needless,"" replied G--."|0|71|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""I am not more sure that I breathe than I am that the letter is not at the Hotel""."|1|71|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""I have no better advice to give you,"" said Dupin."|0|72|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""You have, of course, an accurate description of the letter""?"|1|72|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Oh yes""!"|0|73|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
--And here the Prefect, producing a memorandum-book, proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal, and especially of the external appearance of the missing document.|1|73|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
Soon after finishing the perusal of this description, he took his departure, more entirely depressed in spirits than I had ever known the good gentleman before.|2|73|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
In about a month afterwards he paid us another visit, and found us occupied very nearly as before.|0|74|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
He took a pipe and a chair and entered into some ordinary conversation.|1|74|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Well, but G--, what of the purloined letter?"|0|75|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"I presume you have at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the Minister""?"|1|75|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Confound him, say I --yes; I made the reexamination, however, as Dupin suggested --but it was all labor lost, as I knew it would be""."|0|76|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""How much was the reward offered, did you say""?"|0|77|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
asked Dupin.|1|77|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Why, a very great deal --a very liberal reward --I don't like to say how much, precisely; but one thing I will say, that I wouldn't mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could obtain me that letter."|0|78|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
The fact is, it is becoming of more and more importance every day; and the reward has been lately doubled.|1|78|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"If it were trebled, however, I could do no more than I have done""."|2|78|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Why, yes,"" said Dupin, drawlingly, between the whiffs of his meerschaum, ""I really --think, G--, you have not exerted yourself--to the utmost in this matter."|0|79|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"You might --do a little more, I think, eh""?"|1|79|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""How?"|0|80|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"--In what way""?"|1|80|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Why --puff, puff --you might --puff, puff --employ counsel in the matter, eh?"|0|81|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
--puff, puff, puff.|1|81|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"Do you remember the story they tell of Abernethy""?"|2|81|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""No; hang Abernethy""!"|0|82|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""To be sure!"|0|83|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
hang him and welcome.|1|83|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
But, once upon a time, a certain rich miser conceived the design of spunging upon this Abernethy for a medical opinion.|2|83|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
Getting up, for this purpose, an ordinary conversation in a private company, he insinuated his case to the physician, as that of an imaginary individual.|3|83|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""'We will suppose,' said the miser, 'that his symptoms are such and such; now, doctor, what would you have directed him to take?"|0|84|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""'Take!"|0|85|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
' said Abernethy, 'why, take advice, to be sure.|1|85|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""But,"" said the Prefect, a little discomposed, ""I am perfectly willing to take advice, and to pay for it."|0|86|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"I would really give fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter""."|1|86|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""In that case,"" replied Dupin, opening a drawer, and producing a check-book, ""you may as well fill me up a check for the amount mentioned."|0|87|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"When you have signed it, I will hand you the letter""."|1|87|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
I was astounded.|0|88|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
The Prefect appeared absolutely thunderstricken.|1|88|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
For some minutes he remained speechless and motionless, less, looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth, and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets; then, apparently in some measure, he seized a pen, and after several pauses and vacant stares, finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs, and handed it across the table to Dupin.|2|88|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
The latter examined it carefully and deposited it in his pocket-book; then, unlocking an escritoire, took thence a letter and gave it to the Prefect.|3|88|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
This functionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy, opened it with a trembling hand, cast a rapid glance at its contents, and then, scrambling and struggling to the door, rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the house, without having uttered a syllable since Dupin had requested him to fill up the check.|4|88|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
When he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations.|0|89|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""The Parisian police,"" he said, ""are exceedingly able in their way."|0|90|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
They are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand.|1|90|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"Thus, when G-–detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the Hotel D--, I felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory investigation --so far as his labors extended""."|2|90|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""So far as his labors extended""?"|0|91|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Yes,"" said Dupin."|0|92|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""The measures adopted were not only the best of their kind, but carried out to absolute perfection."|1|92|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"Had the letter been deposited within the range of their search, these fellows would, beyond a question, have found it""."|2|92|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
I merely laughed --but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.|0|93|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""The measures, then,"" he continued, ""were good in their kind, and well executed; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case, and to the man."|0|94|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
A certain set of highly ingenious resources are, with the Prefect, a sort of Procrustean bed, to which he forcibly adapts his designs.|1|94|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
But he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow, for the matter in hand; and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he.|2|94|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
I knew one about eight years of age, whose success at guessing in the game of 'even and odd' attracted universal admiration.|3|94|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
This game is simple, and is played with marbles.|4|94|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
One player holds in his hand a number of these toys, and demands of another whether that number is even or odd.|5|94|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
If the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he loses one.|6|94|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
The boy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the school.|7|94|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
Of course he had some principle of guessing; and this lay in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents.|8|94|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
For example, an arrant simpleton is his opponent, and, holding up his closed hand, asks, 'are they even or odd?|9|94|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
' Our schoolboy replies, 'odd,' and loses; but upon the second trial he wins, for he then says to himself, the simpleton had them even upon the first trial, and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second; I will therefore guess odd'; --he guesses odd, and wins.|10|94|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
Now, with a simpleton a degree above the first, he would have reasoned thus: 'This fellow finds that in the first instance I guessed odd, and, in the second, he will propose to himself upon the first impulse, a simple variation from even to odd, as did the first simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is too simple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting it even as before.|11|94|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
I will therefore guess even' guesses even, and wins.|12|94|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"Now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy, whom his fellows termed ""lucky,"" --what, in its last analysis, is it""?"|13|94|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""It is merely,"" I said, ""an identification of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent""."|0|95|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""It is,"" said Dupin;"" and, upon inquiring of the boy by what means he effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted, I received answer as follows: 'When I wish to find out how wise, or how stupid, or how good, or how wicked is any one, or what are his thoughts at the moment, I fashion the expression of my face, as accurately as possible, in accordance with the expression of his, and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or correspond with the expression."|0|96|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"' This response of the schoolboy lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to Rochefoucauld, to La Bougive, to Machiavelli, and to Campanella""."|1|96|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""And the identification,"" I said, ""of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent, depends, if I understand you aright upon the accuracy with which the opponent's intellect is admeasured""."|0|97|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""For its practical value it depends upon this,"" replied Dupin; and the Prefect and his cohort fall so frequently, first, by default of this identification, and, secondly, by ill-admeasurement, or rather through non-admeasurement, of the intellect with which they are engaged."|0|98|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
They consider only their own ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for anything hidden, advert only to the modes in which they would have hidden it.|1|98|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
They are right in this much --that their own ingenuity is a faithful representative of that of the mass; but when the cunning of the individual felon is diverse in character from their own, the felon foils them, of course.|2|98|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
This always happens when it is above their own, and very usually when it is below.|3|98|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
They have no variation of principle in their investigations; at best, when urged by some unusual emergency --by some extraordinary reward --they extend or exaggerate their old modes of practice, without touching their principles.|4|98|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
What, for example, in this case of D--, has been done to vary the principle of action?|5|98|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
What is all this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with the microscope, and dividing the surface of the building into registered square inches --what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of the one principle or set of principles of search, which are based upon the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity, to which the Prefect, in the long routine of his duty, has been accustomed?|6|98|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
Do you not see he has taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter, --not exactly in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg --but, at least, in some hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg?|7|98|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
And do you not see also, that such recherches nooks for concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions, and would be adopted only by ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of concealment, a disposal of the article concealed --a disposal of it in this recherche manner, --is, in the very first instance, presumable and presumed; and thus its discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether upon the mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers; and where the case is of importance --or, what amounts to the same thing in the policial eyes, when the reward is of magnitude, --the qualities in question have never been known to fall.|8|98|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
You will now understand what I meant in suggesting that, had the purloined letter been hidden anywhere within the limits of the Prefect's examination --in other words, had the principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of the Prefect --its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question.|9|98|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
This functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified; and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the Minister is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet.|10|98|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"All fools are poets; this the Prefect feels; and he is merely guilty of a non distributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are fools""."|11|98|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""But is this really the poet""?"|0|99|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
I asked.|1|99|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""There are two brothers, I know; and both have attained reputation in letters."|2|99|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
The Minister I believe has written learnedly on the Differential Calculus.|3|99|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"He is a mathematician, and no poet""."|4|99|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""You are mistaken; I know him well; he is both."|0|100|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"As poet and mathematician, he would reason well; as mere mathematician, he could not have reasoned at all, and thus would have been at the mercy of the Prefect""."|1|100|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""You surprise me,"" I said, ""by these opinions, which have been contradicted by the voice of the world."|0|101|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
You do not mean to set at naught the well-digested idea of centuries.|1|101|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
The mathematical reason has long been regarded as the reason par excellence.|2|101|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""'Il y a a parier,'"" replied Dupin, quoting from Chamfort, ""'que toute idee publique, toute convention recue, est une sottise, car elle a convenu au plus grand nombre."|0|102|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
' The mathematicians, I grant you, have done their best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude, and which is none the less an error for its promulgation as truth.|1|102|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
With an art worthy a better cause, for example, they have insinuated the term 'analysis' into application to algebra.|2|102|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"The French are the originators of this particular deception; but if a term is of any importance --if words derive any value from applicability --then 'analysis' conveys 'algebra' about as much as, in Latin, 'ambitus' implies 'ambition,' 'religio' religion or 'homines honesti,' a set of honorable men""."|3|102|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""You have a quarrel on hand, I see,"" said I, ""with some of the algebraists of Paris; but proceed""."|0|103|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""I dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that reason which is cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical."|0|104|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
I dispute, in particular, the reason educed by mathematical study.|1|104|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
The mathematics are the science of form and quantity; mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity.|2|104|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
The great error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure algebra, are abstract or general truths.|3|104|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
And this error is so egregious that I am confounded at the universality with which it has been received.|4|104|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
Mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth.|5|104|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
What is true of relation --of form and quantity --is often grossly false in regard to morals, for example.|6|104|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
In this latter science it is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole.|7|104|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
In chemistry also the axiom falls.|8|104|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
In the consideration of motive it falls; for two motives, each of a given value, have not, necessarily, a value when united, equal to the sum of their values apart.|9|104|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
There are numerous other mathematical truths which are only truths within the limits of relation.|10|104|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
But the mathematician argues, from his finite truths, through habit, as if they were of an absolutely general applicability --as the world indeed imagines them to be.|11|104|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
Bryant, in his very learned 'Mythology,' mentions an analogous source of error, when he says that 'although the Pagan fables are not believed, yet we forget ourselves continually, and make inferences from them as existing realities.|12|104|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
' With the algebraists, however, who are Pagans themselves, the 'Pagan fables' are believed, and the inferences are made, not so much through lapse of memory, as through an unaccountable addling of the brains.|13|104|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
In short, I never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that x squared + px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q.|14|104|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe occasions may occur where x squared + px is not altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.|15|104|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"I mean to say,"" continued Dupin, while I merely laughed at his last observations, ""that if the Minister had been no more than a mathematician, the Prefect would have been under no necessity of giving me this check."|0|105|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
I knew him, however, as both mathematician and poet, and my measures were adapted to his capacity, with reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded.|1|105|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
I knew him as a courtier, too, and as a bold intriguant.|2|105|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
Such a man, I considered, could not fall to be aware of the ordinary policial modes of action.|3|105|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
He could not have failed to anticipate --and events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate --the waylayings to which he was subjected.|4|105|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
He must have foreseen, I reflected, the secret investigations of his premises.|5|105|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
His frequent absences from home at night, which were hailed by the Prefect as certain aids to his success, I regarded only as ruses, to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police, and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which G--, in fact, did finally arrive --the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises.|6|105|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
I felt, also, that the whole train of thought, which I was at some pains in detailing to you just now, concerning the invariable principle of policial action in searches for articles concealed --I felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the Minister.|7|105|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
It would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks of concealment.|8|105|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
He could not, I reflected, be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes, to the gimlets, and to the microscopes of the Prefect.|9|105|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
I saw, in fine, that he would be driven, as a matter of course, to simplicity, if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice.|10|105|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"You will remember, perhaps, how desperately the Prefect laughed when I suggested, upon our first interview, that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so very self-evident""."|11|105|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Yes,"" said I, ""I remember his merriment well."|0|106|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"I really thought he would have fAllan into convulsions""."|1|106|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""The material world,"" continued Dupin, ""abounds with very strict analogies to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has been given to the rhetorical dogma, that metaphor, or simile, may be made to strengthen an argument, as well as to embellish a description."|0|107|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
The principle of the vis inertiae, for example, seems to be identical in physics and metaphysics.|1|107|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
It is not more true in the former, that a large body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one, and that its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty, than it is, in the latter, that intellects of the vaster capacity, while more forcible, more constant, and more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade, are yet the less readily moved, and more embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress.|2|107|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"Again: have you ever noticed which of the street signs, over the shop doors, are the most attractive of attention""?"|3|107|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""I have never given the matter a thought,"" I said."|0|108|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""There is a game of puzzles,"" he resumed, ""which is played upon a map."|0|109|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
One party playing requires another to find a given word --the name of town, river, state or empire --any word, in short, upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart.|1|109|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
A novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names; but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large characters, from one end of the chart to the other.|2|109|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
These, like the over-largely lettered signs and placards of the street, escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably self-evident.|3|109|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
But this is a point, it appears, somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the Prefect.|4|109|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
He never once thought it probable, or possible, that the Minister had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the whole world, by way of best preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it.|5|109|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""But the more I reflected upon the daring, dashing, and discriminating ingenuity of D--; upon the fact that the document must always have been at hand, if he intended to use it to good purpose; and upon the decisive evidence, obtained by the Prefect, that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitary's ordinary search --the more satisfied I became that, to conceal this letter, the Minister had resorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all."|0|110|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""Full of these ideas, I prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles, and called one fine morning, quite by accident, at the Ministerial hotel."|0|111|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
I found D-–at home, yawning, lounging, and dawdling, as usual, and pretending to be in the last extremity of ennui.|1|111|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
He is, perhaps, the most really energetic human being now alive --but that is only when nobody sees him.|2|111|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""To be even with him, I complained of my weak eyes, and lamented the necessity of the spectacles, under cover of which I cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the apartment, while seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host."|0|112|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""I paid special attention to a large writing-table near which he sat, and upon which lay confusedly, some miscellaneous letters and other papers, with one or two musical instruments and a few books."|0|113|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
Here, however, after a long and very deliberate scrutiny, I saw nothing to excite particular suspicion.|1|113|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""At length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a trumpery filigree card-rack of pasteboard, that hung dangling by a dirty blue ribbon, from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of the mantelpiece."|0|114|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
In this rack, which had three or four compartments, were five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter.|1|114|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
This last was much soiled and crumpled.|2|114|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
It was torn nearly in two, across the middle --as if a design, in the first instance, to tear it entirely up as worthless, had been altered, or stayed, in the second.|3|114|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
It had a large black seal, bearing the D-–cipher very conspicuously, and was addressed, in a diminutive female hand, to D--, the minister, himself.|4|114|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
It was thrust carelessly, and even, as it seemed, contemptuously, into one of the upper divisions of the rack.|5|114|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""No sooner had I glanced at this letter, than I concluded it to be that of which I was in search."|0|115|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
To be sure, it was, to all appearance, radically different from the one of which the Prefect had read us so minute a description.|1|115|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
Here the seal was large and black, with the D-–cipher; there it was small and red, with the ducal arms of the S-–family.|2|115|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
Here, the address, to the Minister, was diminutive and feminine; there the superscription, to a certain royal personage, was markedly bold and decided; the size alone formed a point of correspondence.|3|115|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
But, then, the radicalness of these differences, which was excessive; the dirt; the soiled and torn condition of the paper, so inconsistent with the true methodical habits of D--, and so suggestive of a design to delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document; these things, together with the hyperobtrusive situation of this document, full in the view of every visitor, and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which I had previously arrived; these things, I say, were strongly corroborative of suspicion, in one who came with the intention to suspect.|4|115|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""I protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I maintained a most animated discussion with the Minister, on a topic which I knew well had never failed to interest and excite him, I kept my attention really riveted upon the letter."|0|116|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
In this examination, I committed to memory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack; and also fell, at length, upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt I might have entertained.|1|116|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
In scrutinizing the edges of the paper, I observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary.|2|116|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
They presented the broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper, having been once folded and pressed with a folder, is refolded in a reversed direction, in the same creases or edges which had formed the original fold.|3|116|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
This discovery was sufficient.|4|116|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
It was clear to me that the letter had been turned, as a glove, inside out, re-directed, and re-sealed.|5|116|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
I bade the Minister good morning, and took my departure at once, leaving a gold snuff-box upon the table.|6|116|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""The next morning I called for the snuff-box, when we resumed, quite eagerly, the conversation of the preceding day."|0|117|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
While thus engaged, however, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard immediately beneath the windows of the hotel, and was succeeded by a series of fearful screams, and the shoutings of a mob.|1|117|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
D-–rushed to a casement, threw it open, and looked out.|2|117|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
In the meantime, I stepped to the card-rack, took the letter, put it in my pocket, and replaced it by a fac-simile, (so far as regards externals,) which I had carefully prepared at my lodgings; imitating the D-–cipher, very readily, by means of a seal formed of bread.|3|117|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
"""The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic behavior of a man with a musket."|0|118|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction
He had fired it among a crowd of women and children.|1|118|The Purloined Letter|1844|Detective fiction

OLD SAYING.|1|0|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
"HAVING had occasion, lately, in the course of some Oriental investigations, to consult the Tellmenow Isitsoornot, a work which (like the Zohar of Simeon Jochaides) is scarcely known at all, even in Europe; and which has never been quoted, to my knowledge, by any American–if we except, perhaps, the author of the ""Curiosities of American Literature"";–having had occasion, I say, to turn over some pages of the first–mentioned very remarkable work, I was not a little astonished to discover that the literary world has hitherto been strangely in error respecting the fate of the vizier's daughter, Scheherazade, as that fate is depicted in the ""Arabian Nights""; and that the denouement there given, if not altogether inaccurate, as far as it goes, is at least to blame in not having gone very much farther."|0|1|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
"For full information on this interesting topic, I must refer the inquisitive reader to the ""Isitsoornot"" itself, but in the meantime, I shall be pardoned for giving a summary of what I there discovered."|0|2|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
It will be remembered, that, in the usual version of the tales, a certain monarch having good cause to be jealous of his queen, not only puts her to death, but makes a vow, by his beard and the prophet, to espouse each night the most beautiful maiden in his dominions, and the next morning to deliver her up to the executioner.|0|3|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
Having fulfilled this vow for many years to the letter, and with a religious punctuality and method that conferred great credit upon him as a man of devout feeling and excellent sense, he was interrupted one afternoon (no doubt at his prayers) by a visit from his grand vizier, to whose daughter, it appears, there had occurred an idea.|0|4|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
Her name was Scheherazade, and her idea was, that she would either redeem the land from the depopulating tax upon its beauty, or perish, after the approved fashion of all heroines, in the attempt.|0|5|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
Accordingly, and although we do not find it to be leap-year (which makes the sacrifice more meritorious), she deputes her father, the grand vizier, to make an offer to the king of her hand.|0|6|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
This hand the king eagerly accepts–(he had intended to take it at all events, and had put off the matter from day to day, only through fear of the vizier),–but, in accepting it now, he gives all parties very distinctly to understand, that, grand vizier or no grand vizier, he has not the slightest design of giving up one iota of his vow or of his privileges.|1|6|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
When, therefore, the fair Scheherazade insisted upon marrying the king, and did actually marry him despite her father's excellent advice not to do any thing of the kind–when she would and did marry him, I say, will I, nill I, it was with her beautiful black eyes as thoroughly open as the nature of the case would allow.|2|6|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
It seems, however, that this politic damsel (who had been reading Machiavelli, beyond doubt), had a very ingenious little plot in her mind.|0|7|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
On the night of the wedding, she contrived, upon I forget what specious pretence, to have her sister occupy a couch sufficiently near that of the royal pair to admit of easy conversation from bed to bed; and, a little before cock-crowing, she took care to awaken the good monarch, her husband (who bore her none the worse will because he intended to wring her neck on the morrow),–she managed to awaken him, I say, (although on account of a capital conscience and an easy digestion, he slept well) by the profound interest of a story (about a rat and a black cat, I think) which she was narrating (all in an undertone, of course) to her sister.|1|7|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
When the day broke, it so happened that this history was not altogether finished, and that Scheherazade, in the nature of things could not finish it just then, since it was high time for her to get up and be bowstrung–a thing very little more pleasant than hanging, only a trifle more genteel.|2|7|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
The king's curiosity, however, prevailing, I am sorry to say, even over his sound religious principles, induced him for this once to postpone the fulfilment of his vow until next morning, for the purpose and with the hope of hearing that night how it fared in the end with the black cat (a black cat, I think it was) and the rat.|0|8|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
The night having arrived, however, the lady Scheherazade not only put the finishing stroke to the black cat and the rat (the rat was blue) but before she well knew what she was about, found herself deep in the intricacies of a narration, having reference (if I am not altogether mistaken) to a pink horse (with green wings) that went, in a violent manner, by clockwork, and was wound up with an indigo key.|0|9|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
With this history the king was even more profoundly interested than with the other–and, as the day broke before its conclusion (notwithstanding all the queen's endeavors to get through with it in time for the bowstringing), there was again no resource but to postpone that ceremony as before, for twenty-four hours.|1|9|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
The next night there happened a similar accident with a similar result; and then the next–and then again the next; so that, in the end, the good monarch, having been unavoidably deprived of all opportunity to keep his vow during a period of no less than one thousand and one nights, either forgets it altogether by the expiration of this time, or gets himself absolved of it in the regular way, or (what is more probable) breaks it outright, as well as the head of his father confessor.|2|9|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
At all events, Scheherazade, who, being lineally descended from Eve, fell heir, perhaps, to the whole seven baskets of talk, which the latter lady, we all know, picked up from under the trees in the garden of Eden-Scheherazade, I say, finally triumphed, and the tariff upon beauty was repealed.|3|9|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
Now, this conclusion (which is that of the story as we have it upon record) is, no doubt, excessively proper and pleasant–but alas!|0|10|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
"like a great many pleasant things, is more pleasant than true, and I am indebted altogether to the ""Isitsoornot"" for the means of correcting the error."|1|10|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
"""Le mieux,"" says a French proverb, ""est l'ennemi du bien,"" and, in mentioning that Scheherazade had inherited the seven baskets of talk, I should have added that she put them out at compound interest until they amounted to seventy-seven."|2|10|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
"""My dear sister,"" said she, on the thousand-and-second night, (I quote the language of the ""Isitsoornot"" at this point, verbatim) ""my dear sister,"" said she, ""now that all this little difficulty about the bowstring has blown over, and that this odious tax is so happily repealed, I feel that I have been guilty of great indiscretion in withholding from you and the king (who I am sorry to say, snores–a thing no gentleman would do) the full conclusion of Sinbad the sailor."|0|11|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
This person went through numerous other and more interesting adventures than those which I related; but the truth is, I felt sleepy on the particular night of their narration, and so was seduced into cutting them short–a grievous piece of misconduct, for which I only trust that Allah will forgive me.|1|11|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
But even yet it is not too late to remedy my great neglect–and as soon as I have given the king a pinch or two in order to wake him up so far that he may stop making that horrible noise, I will forthwith entertain you (and him if he pleases) with the sequel of this very remarkable story.|2|11|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
"Hereupon the sister of Scheherazade, as I have it from the ""Isitsoornot,"" expressed no very particular intensity of gratification; but the king, having been sufficiently pinched, at length ceased snoring, and finally said, ""hum""!"|0|12|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
"and then ""hoo""!"|1|12|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
"""'At length, in my old age, [these are the words of Sinbad himself, as retailed by Scheherazade]–'at length, in my old age, and after enjoying many years of tranquillity at home, I became once more possessed of a desire of visiting foreign countries; and one day, without acquainting any of my family with my design, I packed up some bundles of such merchandise as was most precious and least bulky, and, engaged a porter to carry them, went with him down to the sea-shore, to await the arrival of any chance vessel that might convey me out of the kingdom into some region which I had not as yet explored."|0|13|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor

At length, on the edge of the horizon, we discovered a black speck, which rapidly increased in size until we made it out to be a vast monster, swimming with a great part of its body above the surface of the sea.|3|14|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
It came toward us with inconceivable swiftness, throwing up huge waves of foam around its breast, and illuminating all that part of the sea through which it passed, with a long line of fire that extended far off into the distance.|4|14|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
"""'As the thing drew near we saw it very distinctly."|0|15|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor

Its body, which was unlike that of ordinary fishes, was as solid as a rock, and of a jetty blackness throughout all that portion of it which floated above the water, with the exception of a narrow blood-red streak that completely begirdled it.|2|15|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
The belly, which floated beneath the surface, and of which we could get only a glimpse now and then as the monster rose and fell with the billows, was entirely covered with metallic scales, of a color like that of the moon in misty weather.|3|15|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
The back was flat and nearly white, and from it there extended upwards of six spines, about half the length of the whole body.|4|15|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
"""'The horrible creature had no mouth that we could perceive, but, as if to make up for this deficiency, it was provided with at least four score of eyes, that protruded from their sockets like those of the green dragon-fly, and were arranged all around the body in two rows, one above the other, and parallel to the blood-red streak, which seemed to answer the purpose of an eyebrow."|0|16|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
Two or three of these dreadful eyes were much larger than the others, and had the appearance of solid gold.|1|16|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
"""'Although this beast approached us, as I have before said, with the greatest rapidity, it must have been moved altogether by necromancy- for it had neither fins like a fish nor web-feet like a duck, nor wings like the seashell which is blown along in the manner of a vessel; nor yet did it writhe itself forward as do the eels."|0|17|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
Its head and its tail were shaped precisely alike, only, not far from the latter, were two small holes that served for nostrils, and through which the monster puffed out its thick breath with prodigious violence, and with a shrieking, disagreeable noise.|1|17|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
"""'Our terror at beholding this hideous thing was very great, but it was even surpassed by our astonishment, when upon getting a nearer look, we perceived upon the creature's back a vast number of animals about the size and shape of men, and altogether much resembling them, except that they wore no garments (as men do), being supplied (by nature, no doubt) with an ugly uncomfortable covering, a good deal like cloth, but fitting so tight to the skin, as to render the poor wretches laughably awkward, and put them apparently to severe pain."|0|18|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
On the very tips of their heads were certain square-looking boxes, which, at first sight, I thought might have been intended to answer as turbans, but I soon discovered that they were excessively heavy and solid, and I therefore concluded they were contrivances designed, by their great weight, to keep the heads of the animals steady and safe upon their shoulders.|1|18|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
Around the necks of the creatures were fastened black collars, (badges of servitude, no doubt,) such as we keep on our dogs, only much wider and infinitely stiffer, so that it was quite impossible for these poor victims to move their heads in any direction without moving the body at the same time; and thus they were doomed to perpetual contemplation of their noses–a view puggish and snubby in a wonderful, if not positively in an awful degree.|2|18|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
"""'When the monster had nearly reached the shore where we stood, it suddenly pushed out one of its eyes to a great extent, and emitted from it a terrible flash of fire, accompanied by a dense cloud of smoke, and a noise that I can compare to nothing but thunder."|0|19|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
As the smoke cleared away, we saw one of the odd man-animals standing near the head of the large beast with a trumpet in his hand, through which (putting it to his mouth) he presently addressed us in loud, harsh, and disagreeable accents, that, perhaps, we should have mistaken for language, had they not come altogether through the nose.|1|19|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
"""'Being thus evidently spoken to, I was at a loss how to reply, as I could in no manner understand what was said; and in this difficulty I turned to the porter, who was near swooning through affright, and demanded of him his opinion as to what species of monster it was, what it wanted, and what kind of creatures those were that so swarmed upon its back."|0|20|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
To this the porter replied, as well as he could for trepidation, that he had once before heard of this sea-beast; that it was a cruel demon, with bowels of sulphur and blood of fire, created by evil genii as the means of inflicting misery upon mankind; that the things upon its back were vermin, such as sometimes infest cats and dogs, only a little larger and more savage; and that these vermin had their uses, however evil–for, through the torture they caused the beast by their nibbling and stingings, it was goaded into that degree of wrath which was requisite to make it roar and commit ill, and so fulfil the vengeful and malicious designs of the wicked genii.|1|20|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
"""This account determined me to take to my heels, and, without once even looking behind me, I ran at full speed up into the hills, while the porter ran equally fast, although nearly in an opposite direction, so that, by these means, he finally made his escape with my bundles, of which I have no doubt he took excellent care–although this is a point I cannot determine, as I do not remember that I ever beheld him again."|0|21|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor

I succeeded so well in this endeavor that, in a few days, the creature bestowed upon me various tokens of his favor, and in the end even went to the trouble of teaching me the rudiments of what it was vain enough to denominate its language; so that, at length, I was enabled to converse with it readily, and came to make it comprehend the ardent desire I had of seeing the world.|1|23|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor

*(5) Place a platina crucible over a spirit lamp, and keep it a red heat; pour in some sulphuric acid, which, though the most volatile of bodies at a common temperature, will be found to become completely fixed in a hot crucible, and not a drop evaporates–being surrounded by an atmosphere of its own, it does not, in fact, touch the sides.|0|105|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor
A few drops of water are now introduced, when the acid, immediately coming in contact with the heated sides of the crucible, flies off in sulphurous acid vapor, and so rapid is its progress, that the caloric of the water passes off with it, which falls a lump of ice to the bottom; by taking advantage of the moment before it is allowed to remelt, it may be turned out a lump of ice from a red-hot vessel.|1|105|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor

"""'The wives and daughters of these incomparably great and wise magi,'"" continued Scheherazade, without being in any manner disturbed by these frequent and most ungentlemanly interruptions on the part of her husband–""'the wives and daughters of these eminent conjurers are every thing that is accomplished and refined; and would be every thing that is interesting and beautiful, but for an unhappy fatality that besets them, and from which not even the miraculous powers of their husbands and fathers has, hitherto, been adequate to save."|0|109|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor

She derived, however, great consolation, (during the tightening of the bowstring,) from the reflection that much of the history remained still untold, and that the petulance of her brute of a husband had reaped for him a most righteous reward, in depriving him of many inconceivable adventures.|1|113|The Thousand-And-Second Tale Of Scheherazade|February 1845|Humor

I had a wretched headache, and was desperately drowsy.|1|0|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire

There I found a very eager company assembled.|0|7|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire

It was one of a pair brought, several years previously, by Captain Arthur Sabretash, a cousin of Ponnonner's from a tomb near Eleithias, in the Lybian mountains, a considerable distance above Thebes on the Nile.|0|8|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
The grottoes at this point, although less magnificent than the Theban sepulchres, are of higher interest, on account of affording more numerous illustrations of the private life of the Egyptians.|1|8|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
The chamber from which our specimen was taken, was said to be very rich in such illustrations; the walls being completely covered with fresco paintings and bas-reliefs, while statues, vases, and Mosaic work of rich patterns, indicated the vast wealth of the deceased.|2|8|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
The treasure had been deposited in the Museum precisely in the same condition in which Captain Sabretash had found it;–that is to say, the coffin had not been disturbed.|0|9|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
For eight years it had thus stood, subject only externally to public inspection.|1|9|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
We had now, therefore, the complete Mummy at our disposal; and to those who are aware how very rarely the unransacked antique reaches our shores, it will be evident, at once that we had great reason to congratulate ourselves upon our good fortune.|2|9|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Approaching the table, I saw on it a large box, or case, nearly seven feet long, and perhaps three feet wide, by two feet and a half deep.|0|10|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
It was oblong–not coffin-shaped.|1|10|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
The material was at first supposed to be the wood of the sycamore (platanus), but, upon cutting into it, we found it to be pasteboard, or, more properly, papier mache, composed of papyrus.|2|10|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
It was thickly ornamented with paintings, representing funeral scenes, and other mournful subjects- interspersed among which, in every variety of position, were certain series of hieroglyphical characters, intended, no doubt, for the name of the departed.|3|10|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
By good luck, Mr. Gliddon formed one of our party; and he had no difficulty in translating the letters, which were simply phonetic, and represented the word Allamistakeo.|4|10|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
We had some difficulty in getting this case open without injury; but having at length accomplished the task, we came to a second, coffin-shaped, and very considerably less in size than the exterior one, but resembling it precisely in every other respect.|0|11|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
The interval between the two was filled with resin, which had, in some degree, defaced the colors of the interior box.|1|11|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Upon opening this latter (which we did quite easily), we arrived at a third case, also coffin-shaped, and varying from the second one in no particular, except in that of its material, which was cedar, and still emitted the peculiar and highly aromatic odor of that wood.|0|12|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Between the second and the third case there was no interval–the one fitting accurately within the other.|1|12|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Removing the third case, we discovered and took out the body itself.|0|13|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire

The paintings represented subjects connected with the various supposed duties of the soul, and its presentation to different divinities, with numerous identical human figures, intended, very probably, as portraits of the persons embalmed.|2|13|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Extending from head to foot was a columnar, or perpendicular, inscription, in phonetic hieroglyphics, giving again his name and titles, and the names and titles of his relations.|3|13|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire

Around the small of the waist was a similar collar or belt.|1|14|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire

The eyes (it seemed) had been removed, and glass ones substituted, which were very beautiful and wonderfully life-like, with the exception of somewhat too determined a stare.|4|15|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
The fingers and the nails were brilliantly gilded.|5|15|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Mr. Gliddon was of opinion, from the redness of the epidermis, that the embalmment had been effected altogether by asphaltum; but, on scraping the surface with a steel instrument, and throwing into the fire some of the powder thus obtained, the flavor of camphor and other sweet-scented gums became apparent.|0|16|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
We searched the corpse very carefully for the usual openings through which the entrails are extracted, but, to our surprise, we could discover none.|0|17|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
No member of the party was at that period aware that entire or unopened mummies are not infrequently met.|1|17|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
The brain it was customary to withdraw through the nose; the intestines through an incision in the side; the body was then shaved, washed, and salted; then laid aside for several weeks, when the operation of embalming, properly so called, began.|2|17|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire

The application of electricity to a mummy three or four thousand years old at the least, was an idea, if not very sage, still sufficiently original, and we all caught it at once.|0|19|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
About one-tenth in earnest and nine-tenths in jest, we arranged a battery in the Doctor's study, and conveyed thither the Egyptian.|1|19|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
It was only after much trouble that we succeeded in laying bare some portions of the temporal muscle which appeared of less stony rigidity than other parts of the frame, but which, as we had anticipated, of course, gave no indication of galvanic susceptibility when brought in contact with the wire.|0|20|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
This, the first trial, indeed, seemed decisive, and, with a hearty laugh at our own absurdity, we were bidding each other good night, when my eyes, happening to fall upon those of the Mummy, were there immediately riveted in amazement.|1|20|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
My brief glance, in fact, had sufficed to assure me that the orbs which we had all supposed to be glass, and which were originally noticeable for a certain wild stare, were now so far covered by the lids, that only a small portion of the tunica albuginea remained visible.|2|20|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
With a shout I called attention to the fact, and it became immediately obvious to all.|0|21|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire

We made an incision over the outside of the exterior os sesamoideum pollicis pedis, and thus got at the root of the abductor muscle.|2|23|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Readjusting the battery, we now applied the fluid to the bisected nerves–when, with a movement of exceeding life-likeness, the Mummy first drew up its right knee so as to bring it nearly in contact with the abdomen, and then, straightening the limb with inconceivable force, bestowed a kick upon Doctor Ponnonner, which had the effect of discharging that gentleman, like an arrow from a catapult, through a window into the street below.|3|23|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
We rushed out en masse to bring in the mangled remains of the victim, but had the happiness to meet him upon the staircase, coming up in an unaccountable hurry, brimful of the most ardent philosophy, and more than ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting our experiment with vigor and with zeal.|0|24|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
It was by his advice, accordingly, that we made, upon the spot, a profound incision into the tip of the subject's nose, while the Doctor himself, laying violent hands upon it, pulled it into vehement contact with the wire.|0|25|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Morally and physically–figuratively and literally–was the effect electric.|0|26|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire

I pity and forgive him.|3|27|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
But you, Mr. Gliddon–and you, Silk–who have travelled and resided in Egypt until one might imagine you to the manner born–you, I say who have been so much among us that you speak Egyptian fully as well, I think, as you write your mother tongue–you, whom I have always been led to regard as the firm friend of the mummies–I really did anticipate more gentlemanly conduct from you.|4|27|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
What am I to think of your standing quietly by and seeing me thus unhandsomely used?|5|27|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire

It will be taken for granted, no doubt, that upon hearing this speech under the circumstances, we all either made for the door, or fell into violent hysterics, or went off in a general swoon.|0|28|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
One of these three things was, I say, to be expected.|1|28|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Indeed each and all of these lines of conduct might have been very plausibly pursued.|2|28|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
And, upon my word, I am at a loss to know how or why it was that we pursued neither the one nor the other.|3|28|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
But, perhaps, the true reason is to be sought in the spirit of the age, which proceeds by the rule of contraries altogether, and is now usually admitted as the solution of every thing in the way of paradox and impossibility.|4|28|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Or, perhaps, after all, it was only the Mummy's exceedingly natural and matter-of-course air that divested his words of the terrible.|5|28|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
However this may be, the facts are clear, and no member of our party betrayed any very particular trepidation, or seemed to consider that any thing had gone very especially wrong.|6|28|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
For my part I was convinced it was all right, and merely stepped aside, out of the range of the Egyptian's fist.|0|29|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire

"Do take your thumb out of your mouth""!"|2|31|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Mr. Buckingham, hereupon, gave a slight start, took his right thumb out of the left corner of his mouth, and, by way of indemnification inserted his left thumb in the right corner of the aperture above-mentioned.|0|32|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Not being able to get an answer from Mr. B., the figure turned peevishly to Mr. Gliddon, and, in a peremptory tone, demanded in general terms what we all meant.|0|33|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Mr. Gliddon replied at great length, in phonetics; and but for the deficiency of American printing-offices in hieroglyphical type, it would afford me much pleasure to record here, in the original, the whole of his very excellent speech.|0|34|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
I may as well take this occasion to remark, that all the subsequent conversation in which the Mummy took a part, was carried on in primitive Egyptian, through the medium (so far as concerned myself and other untravelled members of the company)–through the medium, I say, of Messieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, as interpreters.|0|35|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
These gentlemen spoke the mother tongue of the Mummy with inimitable fluency and grace; but I could not help observing that (owing, no doubt, to the introduction of images entirely modern, and, of course, entirely novel to the stranger) the two travellers were reduced, occasionally, to the employment of sensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning.|1|35|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"Mr. Gliddon, at one period, for example, could not make the Egyptian comprehend the term ""politics,"" until he sketched upon the wall, with a bit of charcoal a little carbuncle-nosed gentleman, out at elbows, standing upon a stump, with his left leg drawn back, right arm thrown forward, with his fist shut, the eyes rolled up toward Heaven, and the mouth open at an angle of ninety degrees."|2|35|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"Just in the same way Mr. Buckingham failed to convey the absolutely modern idea ""wig,"" until (at Doctor Ponnonner's suggestion) he grew very pale in the face, and consented to take off his own."|3|35|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
It will be readily understood that Mr. Gliddon's discourse turned chiefly upon the vast benefits accruing to science from the unrolling and disembowelling of mummies; apologizing, upon this score, for any disturbance that might have been occasioned him, in particular, the individual Mummy called Allamistakeo; and concluding with a mere hint (for it could scarcely be considered more) that, as these little matters were now explained, it might be as well to proceed with the investigation intended.|0|36|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Here Doctor Ponnonner made ready his instruments.|1|36|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
In regard to the latter suggestions of the orator, it appears that Allamistakeo had certain scruples of conscience, the nature of which I did not distinctly learn; but he expressed himself satisfied with the apologies tendered, and, getting down from the table, shook hands with the company all round.|0|37|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
When this ceremony was at an end, we immediately busied ourselves in repairing the damages which our subject had sustained from the scalpel.|0|38|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
We sewed up the wound in his temple, bandaged his foot, and applied a square inch of black plaster to the tip of his nose.|1|38|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
It was now observed that the Count (this was the title, it seems, of Allamistakeo) had a slight fit of shivering–no doubt from the cold.|0|39|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
The Doctor immediately repaired to his wardrobe, and soon returned with a black dress coat, made in Jennings' best manner, a pair of sky-blue plaid pantaloons with straps, a pink gingham chemise, a flapped vest of brocade, a white sack overcoat, a walking cane with a hook, a hat with no brim, patent-leather boots, straw-colored kid gloves, an eye-glass, a pair of whiskers, and a waterfall cravat.|1|39|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Owing to the disparity of size between the Count and the doctor (the proportion being as two to one), there was some little difficulty in adjusting these habiliments upon the person of the Egyptian; but when all was arranged, he might have been said to be dressed.|2|39|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Mr. Gliddon, therefore, gave him his arm, and led him to a comfortable chair by the fire, while the Doctor rang the bell upon the spot and ordered a supply of cigars and wine.|3|39|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
The conversation soon grew animated.|0|40|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Much curiosity was, of course, expressed in regard to the somewhat remarkable fact of Allamistakeo's still remaining alive.|1|40|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""I should have thought,"" observed Mr. Buckingham, ""that it is high time you were dead""."|0|41|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""Why,"" replied the Count, very much astonished, ""I am little more than seven hundred years old!"|0|42|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"My father lived a thousand, and was by no means in his dotage when he died""."|1|42|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Here ensued a brisk series of questions and computations, by means of which it became evident that the antiquity of the Mummy had been grossly misjudged.|0|43|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
It had been five thousand and fifty years and some months since he had been consigned to the catacombs at Eleithias.|1|43|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""But my remark,"" resumed Mr. Buckingham, ""had no reference to your age at the period of interment (I am willing to grant, in fact, that you are still a young man), and my illusion was to the immensity of time during which, by your own showing, you must have been done up in asphaltum""."|0|44|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""In what""?"|0|45|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
said the Count.|1|45|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""Ah, yes; I have some faint notion of what you mean; it might be made to answer, no doubt–but in my time we employed scarcely any thing else than the Bichloride of Mercury""."|0|47|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""But what we are especially at a loss to understand,"" said Doctor Ponnonner, ""is how it happens that, having been dead and buried in Egypt five thousand years ago, you are here to-day all alive and looking so delightfully well""."|0|48|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""Had I been, as you say, dead,"" replied the Count, ""it is more than probable that dead, I should still be; for I perceive you are yet in the infancy of Calvanism, and cannot accomplish with it what was a common thing among us in the old days."|0|49|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"But the fact is, I fell into catalepsy, and it was considered by my best friends that I was either dead or should be; they accordingly embalmed me at once–I presume you are aware of the chief principle of the embalming process""?"|1|49|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""Why not altogether""."|0|50|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""Why, I perceive–a deplorable condition of ignorance!"|0|51|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Well I cannot enter into details just now: but it is necessary to explain that to embalm (properly speaking), in Egypt, was to arrest indefinitely all the animal functions subjected to the process.|1|51|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
I use the word 'animal' in its widest sense, as including the physical not more than the moral and vital being.|2|51|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
I repeat that the leading principle of embalmment consisted, with us, in the immediately arresting, and holding in perpetual abeyance, all the animal functions subjected to the process.|3|51|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
To be brief, in whatever condition the individual was, at the period of embalmment, in that condition he remained.|4|51|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"Now, as it is my good fortune to be of the blood of the Scarabaeus, I was embalmed alive, as you see me at present""."|5|51|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""The blood of the Scarabaeus""!"|0|52|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
exclaimed Doctor Ponnonner.|1|52|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""Yes."|0|53|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
The Scarabaeus was the insignium or the 'arms,' of a very distinguished and very rare patrician family.|1|53|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
To be 'of the blood of the Scarabaeus,' is merely to be one of that family of which the Scarabaeus is the insignium.|2|53|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"I speak figuratively""."|3|53|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""But what has this to do with you being alive""?"|0|54|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""Why, it is the general custom in Egypt to deprive a corpse, before embalmment, of its bowels and brains; the race of the Scarabaei alone did not coincide with the custom."|0|55|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"Had I not been a Scarabeus, therefore, I should have been without bowels and brains; and without either it is inconvenient to live""."|1|55|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""I perceive that,"" said Mr. Buckingham, ""and I presume that all the entire mummies that come to hand are of the race of Scarabaei""."|0|56|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""Beyond doubt""."|0|57|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""I thought,"" said Mr. Gliddon, very meekly, ""that the Scarabaeus was one of the Egyptian gods""."|0|58|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""One of the Egyptian what""?"|0|59|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
exclaimed the Mummy, starting to its feet.|1|59|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""Gods""!"|0|60|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
repeated the traveller.|1|60|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""Mr. Gliddon, I really am astonished to hear you talk in this style,"" said the Count, resuming his chair."|0|61|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""No nation upon the face of the earth has ever acknowledged more than one god."|1|61|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
The Scarabaeus, the Ibis, etc.|2|61|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
", were with us (as similar creatures have been with others) the symbols, or media, through which we offered worship to the Creator too august to be more directly approached""."|3|61|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
There was here a pause.|0|62|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
At length the colloquy was renewed by Doctor Ponnonner.|1|62|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""It is not improbable, then, from what you have explained,"" said he, ""that among the catacombs near the Nile there may exist other mummies of the Scarabaeus tribe, in a condition of vitality""?"|0|63|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""There can be no question of it,"" replied the Count; ""all the Scarabaei embalmed accidentally while alive, are alive now."|0|64|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"Even some of those purposely so embalmed, may have been overlooked by their executors, and still remain in the tomb""."|1|64|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""Will you be kind enough to explain,"" I said, ""what you mean by 'purposely so embalmed'""?"|0|65|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""With great pleasure""!"|0|66|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
answered the Mummy, after surveying me leisurely through his eye-glass–for it was the first time I had ventured to address him a direct question.|1|66|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""With great pleasure,"" he said."|0|67|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""The usual duration of man's life, in my time, was about eight hundred years."|1|67|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Few men died, unless by most extraordinary accident, before the age of six hundred; few lived longer than a decade of centuries; but eight were considered the natural term.|2|67|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
After the discovery of the embalming principle, as I have already described it to you, it occurred to our philosophers that a laudable curiosity might be gratified, and, at the same time, the interests of science much advanced, by living this natural term in installments.|3|67|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
In the case of history, indeed, experience demonstrated that something of this kind was indispensable.|4|67|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
An historian, for example, having attained the age of five hundred, would write a book with great labor and then get himself carefully embalmed; leaving instructions to his executors pro tem.|5|67|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
, that they should cause him to be revivified after the lapse of a certain period–say five or six hundred years.|6|67|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Resuming existence at the expiration of this time, he would invariably find his great work converted into a species of hap-hazard note-book–that is to say, into a kind of literary arena for the conflicting guesses, riddles, and personal squabbles of whole herds of exasperated commentators.|7|67|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
These guesses, etc.|8|67|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
, which passed under the name of annotations, or emendations, were found so completely to have enveloped, distorted, and overwhelmed the text, that the author had to go about with a lantern to discover his own book.|9|67|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
When discovered, it was never worth the trouble of the search.|10|67|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
After re-writing it throughout, it was regarded as the bounden duty of the historian to set himself to work immediately in correcting, from his own private knowledge and experience, the traditions of the day concerning the epoch at which he had originally lived.|11|67|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"Now this process of re-scription and personal rectification, pursued by various individual sages from time to time, had the effect of preventing our history from degenerating into absolute fable""."|12|67|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""I beg your pardon,"" said Doctor Ponnonner at this point, laying his hand gently upon the arm of the Egyptian–""I beg your pardon, sir, but may I presume to interrupt you for one moment""?"|0|68|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""By all means, sir,"" replied the Count, drawing up."|0|69|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""I merely wished to ask you a question,"" said the Doctor."|0|70|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""You mentioned the historian's personal correction of traditions respecting his own epoch."|1|70|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"Pray, sir, upon an average what proportion of these Kabbala were usually found to be right""?"|2|70|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""The Kabbala, as you properly term them, sir, were generally discovered to be precisely on a par with the facts recorded in the un-re-written histories themselves;–that is to say, not one individual iota of either was ever known, under any circumstances, to be not totally and radically wrong""."|0|71|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""But since it is quite clear,"" resumed the Doctor, ""that at least five thousand years have elapsed since your entombment, I take it for granted that your histories at that period, if not your traditions were sufficiently explicit on that one topic of universal interest, the Creation, which took place, as I presume you are aware, only about ten centuries before""."|0|72|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""Sir""!"|0|73|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
said the Count Allamistakeo.|1|73|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
The Doctor repeated his remarks, but it was only after much additional explanation that the foreigner could be made to comprehend them.|0|74|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""The ideas you have suggested are to me, I confess, utterly novel."|0|75|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
During my time I never knew any one to entertain so singular a fancy as that the universe (or this world if you will have it so) ever had a beginning at all.|1|75|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
I remember once, and once only, hearing something remotely hinted, by a man of many speculations, concerning the origin of the human race; and by this individual, the very word Adam (or Red Earth), which you make use of, was employed.|2|75|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"He employed it, however, in a generical sense, with reference to the spontaneous germination from rank soil (just as a thousand of the lower genera of creatures are germinated)–the spontaneous germination, I say, of five vast hordes of men, simultaneously upspringing in five distinct and nearly equal divisions of the globe""."|3|75|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Here, in general, the company shrugged their shoulders, and one or two of us touched our foreheads with a very significant air.|0|76|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""The long duration of human life in your time, together with the occasional practice of passing it, as you have explained, in installments, must have had, indeed, a strong tendency to the general development and conglomeration of knowledge."|0|77|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"I presume, therefore, that we are to attribute the marked inferiority of the old Egyptians in all particulars of science, when compared with the moderns, and more especially with the Yankees, altogether to the superior solidity of the Egyptian skull""."|1|77|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""I confess again,"" replied the Count, with much suavity, ""that I am somewhat at a loss to comprehend you; pray, to what particulars of science do you allude""?"|0|78|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Here our whole party, joining voices, detailed, at great length, the assumptions of phrenology and the marvels of animal magnetism.|0|79|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Having heard us to an end, the Count proceeded to relate a few anecdotes, which rendered it evident that prototypes of Gall and Spurzheim had flourished and faded in Egypt so long ago as to have been nearly forgotten, and that the manoeuvres of Mesmer were really very contemptible tricks when put in collation with the positive miracles of the Theban savans, who created lice and a great many other similar things.|0|80|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
I here asked the Count if his people were able to calculate eclipses.|0|81|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
He smiled rather contemptuously, and said they were.|1|81|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
This put me a little out, but I began to make other inquiries in regard to his astronomical knowledge, when a member of the company, who had never as yet opened his mouth, whispered in my ear, that for information on this head, I had better consult Ptolemy (whoever Ptolemy is), as well as one Plutarch de facie lunae.|0|82|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
I then questioned the Mummy about burning-glasses and lenses, and, in general, about the manufacture of glass; but I had not made an end of my queries before the silent member again touched me quietly on the elbow, and begged me for God's sake to take a peep at Diodorus Siculus.|0|83|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
As for the Count, he merely asked me, in the way of reply, if we moderns possessed any such microscopes as would enable us to cut cameos in the style of the Egyptians.|1|83|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
While I was thinking how I should answer this question, little Doctor Ponnonner committed himself in a very extraordinary way.|2|83|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""Look at our architecture""!"|0|84|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
he exclaimed, greatly to the indignation of both the travellers, who pinched him black and blue to no purpose.|1|84|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""Look,"" he cried with enthusiasm, ""at the Bowling-Green Fountain in New York!"|0|85|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"or if this be too vast a contemplation, regard for a moment the Capitol at Washington, D. C.""!"|1|85|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
–and the good little medical man went on to detail very minutely, the proportions of the fabric to which he referred.|2|85|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
He explained that the portico alone was adorned with no less than four and twenty columns, five feet in diameter, and ten feet apart.|3|85|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
The Count said that he regretted not being able to remember, just at that moment, the precise dimensions of any one of the principal buildings of the city of Aznac, whose foundations were laid in the night of Time, but the ruins of which were still standing, at the epoch of his entombment, in a vast plain of sand to the westward of Thebes.|0|86|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
He recollected, however, (talking of the porticoes,) that one affixed to an inferior palace in a kind of suburb called Carnac, consisted of a hundred and forty-four columns, thirty-seven feet in circumference, and twenty-five feet apart.|1|86|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
The approach to this portico, from the Nile, was through an avenue two miles long, composed of sphynxes, statues, and obelisks, twenty, sixty, and a hundred feet in height.|2|86|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
The palace itself (as well as he could remember) was, in one direction, two miles long, and might have been altogether about seven in circuit.|3|86|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Its walls were richly painted all over, within and without, with hieroglyphics.|4|86|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
He would not pretend to assert that even fifty or sixty of the Doctor's Capitols might have been built within these walls, but he was by no means sure that two or three hundred of them might not have been squeezed in with some trouble.|5|86|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
That palace at Carnac was an insignificant little building after all.|6|86|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
He (the Count), however, could not conscientiously refuse to admit the ingenuity, magnificence, and superiority of the Fountain at the Bowling Green, as described by the Doctor.|7|86|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Nothing like it, he was forced to allow, had ever been seen in Egypt or elsewhere.|8|86|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
I here asked the Count what he had to say to our railroads.|0|87|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"""Nothing,"" he replied, ""in particular""."|0|88|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
They were rather slight, rather ill-conceived, and clumsily put together.|1|88|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
They could not be compared, of course, with the vast, level, direct, iron-grooved causeways upon which the Egyptians conveyed entire temples and solid obelisks of a hundred and fifty feet in altitude.|2|88|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
I spoke of our gigantic mechanical forces.|0|89|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
He agreed that we knew something in that way, but inquired how I should have gone to work in getting up the imposts on the lintels of even the little palace at Carnac.|0|90|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
This question I concluded not to hear, and demanded if he had any idea of Artesian wells; but he simply raised his eyebrows; while Mr. Gliddon winked at me very hard and said, in a low tone, that one had been recently discovered by the engineers employed to bore for water in the Great Oasis.|0|91|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
I then mentioned our steel; but the foreigner elevated his nose, and asked me if our steel could have executed the sharp carved work seen on the obelisks, and which was wrought altogether by edge-tools of copper.|0|92|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
This disconcerted us so greatly that we thought it advisable to vary the attack to Metaphysics.|0|93|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
"We sent for a copy of a book called the ""Dial,"" and read out of it a chapter or two about something that is not very clear, but which the Bostonians call the Great Movement of Progress."|1|93|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
The Count merely said that Great Movements were awfully common things in his day, and as for Progress, it was at one time quite a nuisance, but it never progressed.|0|94|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
We then spoke of the great beauty and importance of Democracy, and were at much trouble in impressing the Count with a due sense of the advantages we enjoyed in living where there was suffrage ad libitum, and no king.|0|95|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
He listened with marked interest, and in fact seemed not a little amused.|0|96|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
When we had done, he said that, a great while ago, there had occurred something of a very similar sort.|1|96|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Thirteen Egyptian provinces determined all at once to be free, and to set a magnificent example to the rest of mankind.|2|96|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
They assembled their wise men, and concocted the most ingenious constitution it is possible to conceive.|3|96|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
For a while they managed remarkably well; only their habit of bragging was prodigious.|4|96|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
The thing ended, however, in the consolidation of the thirteen states, with some fifteen or twenty others, in the most odious and insupportable despotism that was ever heard of upon the face of the Earth.|5|96|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
I asked what was the name of the usurping tyrant.|0|97|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
As well as the Count could recollect, it was Mob.|0|98|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Not knowing what to say to this, I raised my voice, and deplored the Egyptian ignorance of steam.|0|99|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
The Count looked at me with much astonishment, but made no answer.|0|100|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
The silent gentleman, however, gave me a violent nudge in the ribs with his elbows–told me I had sufficiently exposed myself for once- and demanded if I was really such a fool as not to know that the modern steam-engine is derived from the invention of Hero, through Solomon de Caus.|1|100|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
We were now in imminent danger of being discomfited; but, as good luck would have it, Doctor Ponnonner, having rallied, returned to our rescue, and inquired if the people of Egypt would seriously pretend to rival the moderns in the all–important particular of dress.|0|101|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
The Count, at this, glanced downward to the straps of his pantaloons, and then taking hold of the end of one of his coat-tails, held it up close to his eyes for some minutes.|0|102|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Letting it fall, at last, his mouth extended itself very gradually from ear to ear; but I do not remember that he said any thing in the way of reply.|1|102|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Hereupon we recovered our spirits, and the Doctor, approaching the Mummy with great dignity, desired it to say candidly, upon its honor as a gentleman, if the Egyptians had comprehended, at any period, the manufacture of either Ponnonner's lozenges or Brandreth's pills.|0|103|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
We looked, with profound anxiety, for an answer–but in vain.|0|104|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
It was not forthcoming.|1|104|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
The Egyptian blushed and hung down his head.|2|104|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Never was triumph more consummate; never was defeat borne with so ill a grace.|3|104|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire
Indeed, I could not endure the spectacle of the poor Mummy's mortification.|4|104|Some Words With A Mummy|April 1845|Satire

–the walls of the myriads of the shining bodies that mere number has appeared to blend into unity?|4|7|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
OINOS.|0|8|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
I clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is no dream.|1|8|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
AGATHOS.|0|9|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
There are no dreams in Aidenn–but it is here whispered that, of this infinity of matter, the sole purpose is to afford infinite springs, at which the soul may allay the thirst to know, which is for ever unquenchable within it–since to quench it, would be to extinguish the soul's self.|1|9|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
Question me then, my Oinos, freely and without fear.|2|9|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
Come!|3|9|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
we will leave to the left the loud harmony of the Pleiades, and swoop outward from the throne into the starry meadows beyond Orion, where, for pansies and violets, and heart's- ease, are the beds of the triplicate and triple–tinted suns.|4|9|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
OINOS.|0|10|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
And now, Agathos, as we proceed, instruct me!|1|10|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
–speak to me in the earth's familiar tones.|2|10|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
I understand not what you hinted to me, just now, of the modes or of the method of what, during mortality, we were accustomed to call Creation.|3|10|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
Do you mean to say that the Creator is not God?|4|10|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
AGATHOS.|0|11|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
I mean to say that the Deity does not create.|1|11|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
OINOS.|0|12|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
Explain.|1|12|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
AGATHOS.|0|13|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
In the beginning only, he created.|1|13|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
The seeming creatures which are now, throughout the universe, so perpetually springing into being, can only be considered as the mediate or indirect, not as the direct or immediate results of the Divine creative power.|2|13|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
OINOS.|0|14|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
Among men, my Agathos, this idea would be considered heretical in the extreme.|1|14|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
AGATHOS.|0|15|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
Among angels, my Oinos, it is seen to be simply true.|1|15|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
OINOS.|0|16|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
I can comprehend you thus far–that certain operations of what we term Nature, or the natural laws, will, under certain conditions, give rise to that which has all the appearance of creation.|1|16|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
Shortly before the final overthrow of the earth, there were, I well remember, many very successful experiments in what some philosophers were weak enough to denominate the creation of animalculae.|2|16|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
AGATHOS.|0|17|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
The cases of which you speak were, in fact, instances of the secondary creation–and of the only species of creation which has ever been, since the first word spoke into existence the first law.|1|17|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
OINOS.|0|18|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
Are not the starry worlds that, from the abyss of nonentity, burst hourly forth into the heavens–are not these stars, Agathos, the immediate handiwork of the King?|1|18|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
AGATHOS.|0|19|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
Let me endeavor, my Oinos, to lead you, step by step, to the conception I intend.|1|19|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
You are well aware that, as no thought can perish, so no act is without infinite result.|2|19|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
We moved our hands, for example, when we were dwellers on the earth, and, in so doing, gave vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it.|3|19|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
This vibration was indefinitely extended, till it gave impulse to every particle of the earth's air, which thenceforward, and for ever, was actuated by the one movement of the hand.|4|19|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
This fact the mathematicians of our globe well knew.|5|19|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
They made the special effects, indeed, wrought in the fluid by special impulses, the subject of exact calculation–so that it became easy to determine in what precise period an impulse of given extent would engirdle the orb, and impress (for ever) every atom of the atmosphere circumambient.|6|19|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
Retrograding, they found no difficulty, from a given effect, under given conditions, in determining the value of the original impulse.|7|19|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
Now the mathematicians who saw that the results of any given impulse were absolutely endless–and who saw that a portion of these results were accurately traceable through the agency of algebraic analysis–who saw, too, the facility of the retrogradation–these men saw, at the same time, that this species of analysis itself, had within itself a capacity for indefinite progress–that there were no bounds conceivable to its advancement and applicability, except within the intellect of him who advanced or applied it.|8|19|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
But at this point our mathematicians paused.|9|19|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
OINOS.|0|20|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
And why, Agathos, should they have proceeded?|1|20|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
AGATHOS.|0|21|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
Because there were some considerations of deep interest beyond.|1|21|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
It was deducible from what they knew, that to a being of infinite understanding–one to whom the perfection of the algebraic analysis lay unfolded–there could be no difficulty in tracing every impulse given the air–and the ether through the air–to the remotest consequences at any even infinitely remote epoch of time.|2|21|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
It is indeed demonstrable that every such impulse given the air, must, in the end, impress every individual thing that exists within the universe;–and the being of infinite understanding–the being whom we have imagined–might trace the remote undulations of the impulse- trace them upward and onward in their influences upon all particles of an matter–upward and onward for ever in their modifications of old forms–or, in other words, in their creation of new–until he found them reflected–unimpressive at last–back from the throne of the Godhead.|3|21|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
And not only could such a thing do this, but at any epoch, should a given result be afforded him–should one of these numberless comets, for example, be presented to his inspection–he could have no difficulty in determining, by the analytic retrogradation, to what original impulse it was due.|4|21|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
This power of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfection–this faculty of referring at all epochs, all effects to all causes–is of course the prerogative of the Deity alone–but in every variety of degree, short of the absolute perfection, is the power itself exercised by the whole host of the Angelic intelligences.|5|21|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
OINOS.|0|22|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
But you speak merely of impulses upon the air.|1|22|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
AGATHOS.|0|23|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
In speaking of the air, I referred only to the earth; but the general proposition has reference to impulses upon the ether- which, since it pervades, and alone pervades all space, is thus the great medium of creation.|1|23|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
OINOS.|0|24|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
Then all motion, of whatever nature, creates?|1|24|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
AGATHOS.|0|25|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
OINOS.|0|26|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
God.|1|26|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
AGATHOS.|0|27|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
I have spoken to you, Oinos, as to a child of the fair Earth which lately perished–of impulses upon the atmosphere of the Earth.|1|27|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
OINOS.|0|28|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
You did.|1|28|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
AGATHOS.|0|29|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
And while I thus spoke, did there not cross your mind some thought of the physical power of words?|1|29|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
Is not every word an impulse on the air?|2|29|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
OINOS.|0|30|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
But why, Agathos, do you weep–and why, oh why do your wings droop as we hover above this fair star–which is the greenest and yet most terrible of all we have encountered in our flight?|1|30|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
Its brilliant flowers look like a fairy dream–but its fierce volcanoes like the passions of a turbulent heart.|2|30|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
AGATHOS.|0|31|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
They are!|1|31|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
–they are!|2|31|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
This wild star–it is now three centuries since, with clasped hands, and with streaming eyes, at the feet of my beloved–I spoke it–with a few passionate sentences- into birth.|3|31|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
Its brilliant flowers are the dearest of all unfulfilled dreams, and its raging volcanoes are the passions of the most turbulent and unhallowed of hearts.|4|31|The Power Of Words|June 1845|Science fiction
IN THE consideration of the faculties and impulses–of the prima mobilia of the human soul, the phrenologists have failed to make room for a propensity which, although obviously existing as a radical, primitive, irreducible sentiment, has been equally overlooked by all the moralists who have preceded them.|0|0|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
In the pure arrogance of the reason, we have all overlooked it.|1|0|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
We have suffered its existence to escape our senses, solely through want of belief–of faith;–whether it be faith in Revelation, or faith in the Kabbala.|2|0|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
The idea of it has never occurred to us, simply because of its supererogation.|3|0|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
We saw no need of the impulse–for the propensity.|4|0|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
We could not perceive its necessity.|5|0|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
We could not understand, that is to say, we could not have understood, had the notion of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself;–we could not have understood in what manner it might be made to further the objects of humanity, either temporal or eternal.|6|0|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
It cannot be denied that phrenology and, in great measure, all metaphysicianism have been concocted a priori.|7|0|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
The intellectual or logical man, rather than the understanding or observant man, set himself to imagine designs–to dictate purposes to God.|8|0|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
Having thus fathomed, to his satisfaction, the intentions of Jehovah, out of these intentions he built his innumerable systems of mind.|9|0|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
In the matter of phrenology, for example, we first determined, naturally enough, that it was the design of the Deity that man should eat.|10|0|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
We then assigned to man an organ of alimentiveness, and this organ is the scourge with which the Deity compels man, will-I nill-I, into eating.|11|0|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
Secondly, having settled it to be God's will that man should continue his species, we discovered an organ of amativeness, forthwith.|12|0|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
And so with combativeness, with ideality, with causality, with constructiveness,–so, in short, with every organ, whether representing a propensity, a moral sentiment, or a faculty of the pure intellect.|13|0|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
And in these arrangements of the Principia of human action, the Spurzheimites, whether right or wrong, in part, or upon the whole, have but followed, in principle, the footsteps of their predecessors: deducing and establishing every thing from the preconceived destiny of man, and upon the ground of the objects of his Creator.|14|0|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
It would have been wiser, it would have been safer, to classify (if classify we must) upon the basis of what man usually or occasionally did, and was always occasionally doing, rather than upon the basis of what we took it for granted the Deity intended him to do.|0|1|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
If we cannot comprehend God in his visible works, how then in his inconceivable thoughts, that call the works into being?|1|1|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
If we cannot understand him in his objective creatures, how then in his substantive moods and phases of creation?|2|1|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
Induction, a posteriori, would have brought phrenology to admit, as an innate and primitive principle of human action, a paradoxical something, which we may call perverseness, for want of a more characteristic term.|0|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
In the sense I intend, it is, in fact, a mobile without motive, a motive not motivirt.|1|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
Through its promptings we act without comprehensible object; or, if this shall be understood as a contradiction in terms, we may so far modify the proposition as to say, that through its promptings we act, for the reason that we should not.|2|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
In theory, no reason can be more unreasonable, but, in fact, there is none more strong.|3|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
With certain minds, under certain conditions, it becomes absolutely irresistible.|4|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
I am not more certain that I breathe, than that the assurance of the wrong or error of any action is often the one unconquerable force which impels us, and alone impels us to its prosecution.|5|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
Nor will this overwhelming tendency to do wrong for the wrong's sake, admit of analysis, or resolution into ulterior elements.|6|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
It is a radical, a primitive impulse-elementary.|7|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
It will be said, I am aware, that when we persist in acts because we feel we should not persist in them, our conduct is but a modification of that which ordinarily springs from the combativeness of phrenology.|8|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
But a glance will show the fallacy of this idea.|9|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
The phrenological combativeness has for its essence, the necessity of self-defence.|10|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
It is our safeguard against injury.|11|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
Its principle regards our well-being; and thus the desire to be well is excited simultaneously with its development.|12|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
It follows, that the desire to be well must be excited simultaneously with any principle which shall be merely a modification of combativeness, but in the case of that something which I term perverseness, the desire to be well is not only not aroused, but a strongly antagonistical sentiment exists.|13|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
An appeal to one's own heart is, after all, the best reply to the sophistry just noticed.|0|3|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
No one who trustingly consults and thoroughly questions his own soul, will be disposed to deny the entire radicalness of the propensity in question.|1|3|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
It is not more incomprehensible than distinctive.|2|3|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
There lives no man who at some period has not been tormented, for example, by an earnest desire to tantalize a listener by circumlocution.|3|3|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
The speaker is aware that he displeases; he has every intention to please, he is usually curt, precise, and clear, the most laconic and luminous language is struggling for utterance upon his tongue, it is only with difficulty that he restrains himself from giving it flow; he dreads and deprecates the anger of him whom he addresses; yet, the thought strikes him, that by certain involutions and parentheses this anger may be engendered.|4|3|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
That single thought is enough.|5|3|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
The impulse increases to a wish, the wish to a desire, the desire to an uncontrollable longing, and the longing (to the deep regret and mortification of the speaker, and in defiance of all consequences) is indulged.|6|3|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
We have a task before us which must be speedily performed.|0|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
We know that it will be ruinous to make delay.|1|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
The most important crisis of our life calls, trumpet-tongued, for immediate energy and action.|2|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
We glow, we are consumed with eagerness to commence the work, with the anticipation of whose glorious result our whole souls are on fire.|3|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
It must, it shall be undertaken to-day, and yet we put it off until to-morrow, and why?|4|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
There is no answer, except that we feel perverse, using the word with no comprehension of the principle.|5|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
To-morrow arrives, and with it a more impatient anxiety to do our duty, but with this very increase of anxiety arrives, also, a nameless, a positively fearful, because unfathomable, craving for delay.|6|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
This craving gathers strength as the moments fly.|7|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
The last hour for action is at hand.|8|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
We tremble with the violence of the conflict within us,–of the definite with the indefinite–of the substance with the shadow.|9|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
But, if the contest have proceeded thus far, it is the shadow which prevails,–we struggle in vain.|10|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
The clock strikes, and is the knell of our welfare.|11|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
At the same time, it is the chanticleer- note to the ghost that has so long overawed us.|12|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
It flies–it disappears–we are free.|13|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
The old energy returns.|14|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
We will labor now.|15|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
Alas, it is too late!|16|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
We stand upon the brink of a precipice.|0|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
We peer into the abyss–we grow sick and dizzy.|1|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
Our first impulse is to shrink from the danger.|2|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
Unaccountably we remain.|3|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
By slow degrees our sickness and dizziness and horror become merged in a cloud of unnamable feeling.|4|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
By gradations, still more imperceptible, this cloud assumes shape, as did the vapor from the bottle out of which arose the genius in the Arabian Nights.|5|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
But out of this our cloud upon the precipice's edge, there grows into palpability, a shape, far more terrible than any genius or any demon of a tale, and yet it is but a thought, although a fearful one, and one which chills the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the delight of its horror.|6|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
It is merely the idea of what would be our sensations during the sweeping precipitancy of a fall from such a height.|7|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
And this fall–this rushing annihilation- for the very reason that it involves that one most ghastly and loathsome of all the most ghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering which have ever presented themselves to our imagination–for this very cause do we now the most vividly desire it.|8|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
And because our reason violently deters us from the brink, therefore do we the most impetuously approach it.|9|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
There is no passion in nature so demoniacally impatient, as that of him who, shuddering upon the edge of a precipice, thus meditates a Plunge.|10|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
To indulge, for a moment, in any attempt at thought, is to be inevitably lost; for reflection but urges us to forbear, and therefore it is, I say, that we cannot.|11|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
If there be no friendly arm to check us, or if we fail in a sudden effort to prostrate ourselves backward from the abyss, we plunge, and are destroyed.|12|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
Examine these similar actions as we will, we shall find them resulting solely from the spirit of the Perverse.|0|6|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
We perpetrate them because we feel that we should not.|1|6|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
Beyond or behind this there is no intelligible principle; and we might, indeed, deem this perverseness a direct instigation of the Arch-Fiend, were it not occasionally known to operate in furtherance of good.|2|6|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
I have said thus much, that in some measure I may answer your question, that I may explain to you why I am here, that I may assign to you something that shall have at least the faint aspect of a cause for my wearing these fetters, and for my tenanting this cell of the condemned.|0|7|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
Had I not been thus prolix, you might either have misunderstood me altogether, or, with the rabble, have fancied me mad.|1|7|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
As it is, you will easily perceive that I am one of the many uncounted victims of the Imp of the Perverse.|2|7|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
It is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a more thorough deliberation.|0|8|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
For weeks, for months, I pondered upon the means of the murder.|1|8|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
I rejected a thousand schemes, because their accomplishment involved a chance of detection.|2|8|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
At length, in reading some French Memoirs, I found an account of a nearly fatal illness that occurred to Madame Pilau, through the agency of a candle accidentally poisoned.|3|8|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
The idea struck my fancy at once.|4|8|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
I knew my victim's habit of reading in bed.|5|8|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
I knew, too, that his apartment was narrow and ill-ventilated.|6|8|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
But I need not vex you with impertinent details.|7|8|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
I need not describe the easy artifices by which I substituted, in his bed-room candle-stand, a wax-light of my own making for the one which I there found.|8|8|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
"The next morning he was discovered dead in his bed, and the Coroner's verdict was–""Death by the visitation of God""."|9|8|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
Having inherited his estate, all went well with me for years.|0|9|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
The idea of detection never once entered my brain.|1|9|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
Of the remains of the fatal taper I had myself carefully disposed.|2|9|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
I had left no shadow of a clew by which it would be possible to convict, or even to suspect me of the crime.|3|9|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
It is inconceivable how rich a sentiment of satisfaction arose in my bosom as I reflected upon my absolute security.|4|9|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
For a very long period of time I was accustomed to revel in this sentiment.|5|9|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
It afforded me more real delight than all the mere worldly advantages accruing from my sin.|6|9|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
But there arrived at length an epoch, from which the pleasurable feeling grew, by scarcely perceptible gradations, into a haunting and harassing thought.|7|9|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
It harassed because it haunted.|8|9|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
I could scarcely get rid of it for an instant.|9|9|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
It is quite a common thing to be thus annoyed with the ringing in our ears, or rather in our memories, of the burthen of some ordinary song, or some unimpressive snatches from an opera.|10|9|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
Nor will we be the less tormented if the song in itself be good, or the opera air meritorious.|11|9|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
"In this manner, at last, I would perpetually catch myself pondering upon my security, and repeating, in a low undertone, the phrase, ""I am safe""."|12|9|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
One day, whilst sauntering along the streets, I arrested myself in the act of murmuring, half aloud, these customary syllables.|0|10|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
"In a fit of petulance, I remodelled them thus; ""I am safe–I am safe- yes–if I be not fool enough to make open confession""!"|1|10|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
No sooner had I spoken these words, than I felt an icy chill creep to my heart.|0|11|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
I had had some experience in these fits of perversity, (whose nature I have been at some trouble to explain), and I remembered well that in no instance I had successfully resisted their attacks.|1|11|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
And now my own casual self-suggestion that I might possibly be fool enough to confess the murder of which I had been guilty, confronted me, as if the very ghost of him whom I had murdered–and beckoned me on to death.|2|11|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror

Every succeeding wave of thought overwhelmed me with new terror, for, alas!|3|12|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
I well, too well understood that to think, in my situation, was to be lost.|4|12|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
I still quickened my pace.|5|12|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
I bounded like a madman through the crowded thoroughfares.|6|12|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
At length, the populace took the alarm, and pursued me.|7|12|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
I felt then the consummation of my fate.|8|12|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
Could I have torn out my tongue, I would have done it, but a rough voice resounded in my ears–a rougher grasp seized me by the shoulder.|9|12|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
I turned–I gasped for breath.|10|12|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
For a moment I experienced all the pangs of suffocation; I became blind, and deaf, and giddy; and then some invisible fiend, I thought, struck me with his broad palm upon the back.|11|12|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror
The long imprisoned secret burst forth from my soul.|12|12|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror

Having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial conviction, I fell prostrate in a swoon.|0|14|The Imp Of The Perverse|July 1845|Horror

As I had never visited a place of the kind, I thought the opportunity too good to be lost; and so proposed to my travelling companion (a gentleman with whom I had made casual acquaintance a few days before) that we should turn aside, for an hour or so, and look through the establishment.|1|0|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
To this he objected–pleading haste in the first place, and, in the second, a very usual horror at the sight of a lunatic.|2|0|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
He begged me, however, not to let any mere courtesy towards himself interfere with the gratification of my curiosity, and said that he would ride on leisurely, so that I might overtake him during the day, or, at all events, during the next.|3|0|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
As he bade me good-bye, I bethought me that there might be some difficulty in obtaining access to the premises, and mentioned my fears on this point.|4|0|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
He replied that, in fact, unless I had personal knowledge of the superintendent, Monsieur Maillard, or some credential in the way of a letter, a difficulty might be found to exist, as the regulations of these private mad-houses were more rigid than the public hospital laws.|5|0|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
For himself, he added, he had, some years since, made the acquaintance of Maillard, and would so far assist me as to ride up to the door and introduce me; although his feelings on the subject of lunacy would not permit of his entering the house.|6|0|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
I thanked him, and, turning from the main road, we entered a grass-grown by-path, which, in half an hour, nearly lost itself in a dense forest, clothing the base of a mountain.|0|1|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor

In an instant afterward, this man came forth, accosted my companion by name, shook him cordially by the hand, and begged him to alight.|1|2|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
It was Monsieur Maillard himself.|2|2|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
He was a portly, fine-looking gentleman of the old school, with a polished manner, and a certain air of gravity, dignity, and authority which was very impressive.|3|2|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
My friend, having presented me, mentioned my desire to inspect the establishment, and received Monsieur Maillard's assurance that he would show me all attention, now took leave, and I saw him no more.|0|3|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
When he had gone, the superintendent ushered me into a small and exceedingly neat parlor, containing, among other indications of refined taste, many books, drawings, pots of flowers, and musical instruments.|0|4|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor

Her voice was low, and her whole manner subdued.|3|4|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
I thought, too, that I perceived the traces of sorrow in her countenance, which was excessively, although to my taste, not unpleasingly, pale.|4|4|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
She was attired in deep mourning, and excited in my bosom a feeling of mingled respect, interest, and admiration.|5|4|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
"I had heard, at Paris, that the institution of Monsieur Maillard was managed upon what is vulgarly termed the ""system of soothing""–that all punishments were avoided–that even confinement was seldom resorted to–that the patients, while secretly watched, were left much apparent liberty, and that most of them were permitted to roam about the house and grounds in the ordinary apparel of persons in right mind."|0|5|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
Keeping these impressions in view, I was cautious in what I said before the young lady; for I could not be sure that she was sane; and, in fact, there was a certain restless brilliancy about her eyes which half led me to imagine she was not.|0|6|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
I confined my remarks, therefore, to general topics, and to such as I thought would not be displeasing or exciting even to a lunatic.|1|6|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
She replied in a perfectly rational manner to all that I said; and even her original observations were marked with the soundest good sense, but a long acquaintance with the metaphysics of mania, had taught me to put no faith in such evidence of sanity, and I continued to practise, throughout the interview, the caution with which I commenced it.|2|6|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
Presently a smart footman in livery brought in a tray with fruit, wine, and other refreshments, of which I partook, the lady soon afterward leaving the room.|0|7|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor

While my former system was in operation, and my patients were permitted the privilege of roaming to and fro at will, they were often aroused to a dangerous frenzy by injudicious persons who called to inspect the house.|2|10|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor

We have had men, for example, who fancied themselves chickens.|4|16|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
The cure was, to insist upon the thing as a fact–to accuse the patient of stupidity in not sufficiently perceiving it to be a fact–and thus to refuse him any other diet for a week than that which properly appertains to a chicken.|5|16|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor

We affected to treat each individual as if for some ordinary physical disorder, and the word 'lunacy' was never employed.|2|18|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor

They were, apparently, people of rank-certainly of high breeding–although their habiliments, I thought, were extravagantly rich, partaking somewhat too much of the ostentatious finery of the vielle cour.|1|31|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
I noticed that at least two-thirds of these guests were ladies; and some of the latter were by no means accoutred in what a Parisian would consider good taste at the present day.|2|31|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
Many females, for example, whose age could not have been less than seventy were bedecked with a profusion of jewelry, such as rings, bracelets, and earrings, and wore their bosoms and arms shamefully bare.|3|31|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
I observed, too, that very few of the dresses were well made–or, at least, that very few of them fitted the wearers.|4|31|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
In looking about, I discovered the interesting girl to whom Monsieur Maillard had presented me in the little parlor; but my surprise was great to see her wearing a hoop and farthingale, with high-heeled shoes, and a dirty cap of Brussels lace, so much too large for her that it gave her face a ridiculously diminutive expression.|5|31|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
When I had first seen her, she was attired, most becomingly, in deep mourning.|6|31|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
"There was an air of oddity, in short, about the dress of the whole party, which, at first, caused me to recur to my original idea of the ""soothing system,"" and to fancy that Monsieur Maillard had been willing to deceive me until after dinner, that I might experience no uncomfortable feelings during the repast, at finding myself dining with lunatics; but I remembered having been informed, in Paris, that the southern provincialists were a peculiarly eccentric people, with a vast number of antiquated notions; and then, too, upon conversing with several members of the company, my apprehensions were immediately and fully dispelled."|7|31|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
The dining-room itself, although perhaps sufficiently comfortable and of good dimensions, had nothing too much of elegance about it.|0|32|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
For example, the floor was uncarpeted; in France, however, a carpet is frequently dispensed with.|1|32|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
The windows, too, were without curtains; the shutters, being shut, were securely fastened with iron bars, applied diagonally, after the fashion of our ordinary shop-shutters.|2|32|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
The apartment, I observed, formed, in itself, a wing of the chateau, and thus the windows were on three sides of the parallelogram, the door being at the other.|3|32|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
There were no less than ten windows in all.|4|32|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor

There seemed very little taste, however, in the arrangements; and my eyes, accustomed to quiet lights, were sadly offended by the prodigious glare of a multitude of wax candles, which, in silver candelabra, were deposited upon the table, and all about the room, wherever it was possible to find a place.|5|33|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
There were several active servants in attendance; and, upon a large table, at the farther end of the apartment, were seated seven or eight people with fiddles, fifes, trombones, and a drum.|6|33|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
These fellows annoyed me very much, at intervals, during the repast, by an infinite variety of noises, which were intended for music, and which appeared to afford much entertainment to all present, with the exception of myself.|7|33|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
Upon the whole, I could not help thinking that there was much of the bizarre about every thing I saw–but then the world is made up of all kinds of persons, with all modes of thought, and all sorts of conventional customs.|0|34|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
I had travelled, too, so much, as to be quite an adept at the nil admirari; so I took my seat very coolly at the right hand of my host, and, having an excellent appetite, did justice to the good cheer set before me.|1|34|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
The conversation, in the meantime, was spirited and general.|0|35|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
The ladies, as usual, talked a great deal.|1|35|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
I soon found that nearly all the company were well educated; and my host was a world of good-humored anecdote in himself.|2|35|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
He seemed quite willing to speak of his position as superintendent of a Maison de Sante; and, indeed, the topic of lunacy was, much to my surprise, a favorite one with all present.|3|35|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor

He was a troublesome patient; and we had much ado to keep him within bounds.|1|37|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor

A closer scrutiny assured me, however, that it was only a small calf roasted whole, and set upon its knees, with an apple in its mouth, as is the English fashion of dressing a hare.|1|42|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
"""Thank you, no,"" I replied; ""to say the truth, I am not particularly partial to veal a la St.–what is it?"|0|43|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor

"I will change my plate, however, and try some of the rabbit""."|2|43|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
There were several side-dishes on the table, containing what appeared to be the ordinary French rabbit–a very delicious morceau, which I can recommend.|0|44|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor

"""And then,"" said a cadaverous looking personage, near the foot of the table, taking up the thread of the conversation where it had been broken off,–""and then, among other oddities, we had a patient, once upon a time, who very pertinaciously maintained himself to be a Cordova cheese, and went about, with a knife in his hand, soliciting his friends to try a small slice from the middle of his leg""."|0|50|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor

Here the speaker, very rudely, as I thought, put his right thumb in his left cheek, withdrew it with a sound resembling the popping of a cork, and then, by a dexterous movement of the tongue upon the teeth, created a sharp hissing and fizzing, which lasted for several minutes, in imitation of the frothing of champagne.|0|52|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
This behavior, I saw plainly, was not very pleasing to Monsieur Maillard; but that gentleman said nothing, and the conversation was resumed by a very lean little man in a big wig.|1|52|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor

It is not impossible that he was wrong; but he would have convinced you of his being in the right; for he was a man of great eloquence.|3|59|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor

"""And then,"" said the friend who had whispered, ""there was Boullard, the tee-totum."|0|61|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor

My nerves were very much affected, indeed, by these yells; but the rest of the company I really pitied.|0|68|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
I never saw any set of reasonable people so thoroughly frightened in my life.|1|68|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor

It came again–louder and seemingly nearer–and then a third time very loud, and then a fourth time with a vigor evidently diminished.|3|68|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor
At this apparent dying away of the noise, the spirits of the company were immediately regained, and all was life and anecdote as before.|4|68|The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether|November 1845|Humor

Mr. L--l and the nurses remained.|4|20|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
We left M. Valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three o'clock in the morning, when I approached him and found him in precisely the same condition as when Dr. F-–went away --that is to say, he lay in the same position; the pulse was imperceptible; the breathing was gentle (scarcely noticeable, unless through the application of a mirror to the lips); the eyes were closed naturally; and the limbs were as rigid and as cold as marble.|0|21|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
Still, the general appearance was certainly not that of death.|1|21|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
As I approached M. Valdemar I made a kind of half effort to influence his right arm into pursuit of my own, as I passed the latter gently to and fro above his person.|0|22|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
In such experiments with this patient had never perfectly succeeded before, and assuredly I had little thought of succeeding now; but to my astonishment, his arm very readily, although feebly, followed every direction I assigned it with mine.|1|22|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
I determined to hazard a few words of conversation.|2|22|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
"""M."|0|23|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
"Valdemar,"" I said, ""are you asleep""?"|1|23|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
He made no answer, but I perceived a tremor about the lips, and was thus induced to repeat the question, again and again.|2|23|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
"""Yes; --asleep now."|0|24|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
Do not wake me!|1|24|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
"--let me die so""!"|2|24|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
I here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever.|0|25|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
The right arm, as before, obeyed the direction of my hand.|1|25|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
"""Do you still feel pain in the breast, M. Valdemar""?"|0|26|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
"""No pain --I am dying""."|0|28|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
I did not think it advisable to disturb him farther just then, and nothing more was said or done until the arrival of Dr. F--, who came a little before sunrise, and expressed unbounded astonishment at finding the patient still alive.|0|29|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
After feeling the pulse and applying a mirror to the lips, he requested me to speak to the sleep-waker again.|1|29|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
"""M."|0|30|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
"Valdemar, do you still sleep""?"|1|30|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
As before, some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made; and during the interval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies to speak.|0|31|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
"""Yes; still asleep --dying""."|0|32|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
It was now the opinion, or rather the wish, of the physicians, that M. Valdemar should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his present apparently tranquil condition, until death should supervene --and this, it was generally agreed, must now take place within a few minutes.|0|33|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
I concluded, however, to speak to him once more, and merely repeated my previous question.|1|33|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
While I spoke, there came a marked change over the countenance of the sleep-waker.|0|34|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
The eyes rolled themselves slowly open, the pupils disappearing upwardly; the skin generally assumed a cadaverous hue, resembling not so much parchment as white paper; and the circular hectic spots which, hitherto, had been strongly defined in the centre of each cheek, went out at once.|1|34|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
I use this expression, because the suddenness of their departure put me in mind of nothing so much as the extinguishment of a candle by a puff of the breath.|2|34|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
The upper lip, at the same time, writhed itself away from the teeth, which it had previously covered completely; while the lower jaw fell with an audible jerk, leaving the mouth widely extended, and disclosing in full view the swollen and blackened tongue.|3|34|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
I presume that no member of the party then present had been unaccustomed to death-bed horrors; but so hideous beyond conception was the appearance of M. Valdemar at this moment, that there was a general shrinking back from the region of the bed.|4|34|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
I now feel that I have reached a point of this narrative at which every reader will be startled into positive disbelief.|0|35|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
It is my business, however, simply to proceed.|1|35|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
There was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in M. Valdemar; and concluding him to be dead, we were consigning him to the charge of the nurses, when a strong vibratory motion was observable in the tongue.|0|36|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
This continued for perhaps a minute.|1|36|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
At the expiration of this period, there issued from the distended and motionless jaws a voice --such as it would be madness in me to attempt describing.|2|36|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
There are, indeed, two or three epithets which might be considered as applicable to it in part; I might say, for example, that the sound was harsh, and broken and hollow; but the hideous whole is indescribable, for the simple reason that no similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of humanity.|3|36|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
There were two particulars, nevertheless, which I thought then, and still think, might fairly be stated as characteristic of the intonation --as well adapted to convey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity.|4|36|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
In the first place, the voice seemed to reach our ears --at least mine --from a vast distance, or from some deep cavern within the earth.|5|36|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
In the second place, it impressed me (I fear, indeed, that it will be impossible to make myself comprehended) as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress the sense of touch.|6|36|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
"I have spoken both of ""sound"" and of ""voice""."|0|37|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
I mean to say that the sound was one of distinct --of even wonderfully, thrillingly distinct --syllabification.|1|37|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
M. Valdemar spoke --obviously in reply to the question I had propounded to him a few minutes before.|2|37|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
I had asked him, it will be remembered, if he still slept.|3|37|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
"""Yes; --no; --I have been sleeping --and now --now --I am dead."|0|38|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
No person present even affected to deny, or attempted to repress, the unutterable, shuddering horror which these few words, thus uttered, were so well calculated to convey.|0|39|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
Mr. L--l (the student) swooned.|1|39|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
The nurses immediately left the chamber, and could not be induced to return.|2|39|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
My own impressions I would not pretend to render intelligible to the reader.|3|39|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
For nearly an hour, we busied ourselves, silently --without the utterance of a word --in endeavors to revive Mr. L--l.|4|39|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
When he came to himself, we addressed ourselves again to an investigation of M. Valdemar's condition.|5|39|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
It remained in all respects as I have last described it, with the exception that the mirror no longer afforded evidence of respiration.|0|40|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
An attempt to draw blood from the arm failed.|1|40|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
I should mention, too, that this limb was no farther subject to my will.|2|40|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
I endeavored in vain to make it follow the direction of my hand.|3|40|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
The only real indication, indeed, of the mesmeric influence, was now found in the vibratory movement of the tongue, whenever I addressed M. Valdemar a question.|4|40|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
He seemed to be making an effort to reply, but had no longer sufficient volition.|5|40|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
To queries put to him by any other person than myself he seemed utterly insensible --although I endeavored to place each member of the company in mesmeric rapport with him.|6|40|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
I believe that I have now related all that is necessary to an understanding of the sleep-waker's state at this epoch.|7|40|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
Other nurses were procured; and at ten o'clock I left the house in company with the two physicians and Mr. L--l.|8|40|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
In the afternoon we all called again to see the patient.|0|41|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
His condition remained precisely the same.|1|41|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
We had now some discussion as to the propriety and feasibility of awakening him; but we had little difficulty in agreeing that no good purpose would be served by so doing.|2|41|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
It was evident that, so far, death (or what is usually termed death) had been arrested by the mesmeric process.|3|41|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
It seemed clear to us all that to awaken M. Valdemar would be merely to insure his instant, or at least his speedy dissolution.|4|41|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
From this period until the close of last week --an interval of nearly seven months --we continued to make daily calls at M. Valdemar's house, accompanied, now and then, by medical and other friends.|0|42|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
All this time the sleeper-waker remained exactly as I have last described him.|1|42|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
The nurses' attentions were continual.|2|42|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
It was on Friday last that we finally resolved to make the experiment of awakening or attempting to awaken him; and it is the (perhaps) unfortunate result of this latter experiment which has given rise to so much discussion in private circles --to so much of what I cannot help thinking unwarranted popular feeling.|0|43|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
For the purpose of relieving M. Valdemar from the mesmeric trance, I made use of the customary passes.|0|44|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
These, for a time, were unsuccessful.|1|44|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
The first indication of revival was afforded by a partial descent of the iris.|2|44|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
It was observed, as especially remarkable, that this lowering of the pupil was accompanied by the profuse out-flowing of a yellowish ichor (from beneath the lids) of a pungent and highly offensive odor.|3|44|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
It was now suggested that I should attempt to influence the patient's arm, as heretofore.|0|45|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
I made the attempt and failed.|1|45|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
Dr. F-- then intimated a desire to have me put a question.|2|45|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
"""M."|0|46|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
"Valdemar, can you explain to us what are your feelings or wishes now""?"|1|46|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax

"--I say to you that I am dead""!"|6|48|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
I was thoroughly unnerved, and for an instant remained undecided what to do.|0|49|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
At first I made an endeavor to re-compose the patient; but, failing in this through total abeyance of the will, I retraced my steps and as earnestly struggled to awaken him.|1|49|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
In this attempt I soon saw that I should be successful --or at least I soon fancied that my success would be complete --and I am sure that all in the room were prepared to see the patient awaken.|2|49|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
For what really occurred, however, it is quite impossible that any human being could have been prepared.|0|50|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
"As I rapidly made the mesmeric passes, amid ejaculations of ""dead!"|0|51|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
"dead""!"|1|51|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from the lips of the sufferer, his whole frame at once --within the space of a single minute, or even less, shrunk --crumbled --absolutely rotted away beneath my hands.|2|51|The Facts In The Case Of M.

Upon the bed, before that whole company, there lay a nearly liquid mass of loathsome --of detestable putridity.|3|51|The Facts In The Case Of M. Valdemar|December 1845|Horror / Science fiction / Hoax
DURING the dread reign of the Cholera in New York, I had accepted the invitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement of his cottage ornee on the banks of the Hudson.|0|0|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
We had here around us all the ordinary means of summer amusement; and what with rambling in the woods, sketching, boating, fishing, bathing, music, and books, we should have passed the time pleasantly enough, but for the fearful intelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city.|1|0|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
Not a day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some acquaintance.|2|0|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
Then as the fatality increased, we learned to expect daily the loss of some friend.|3|0|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
At length we trembled at the approach of every messenger.|4|0|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
The very air from the South seemed to us redolent with death.|5|0|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
That palsying thought, indeed, took entire posession of my soul.|6|0|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
I could neither speak, think, nor dream of any thing else.|7|0|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
My host was of a less excitable temperament, and, although greatly depressed in spirits, exerted himself to sustain my own.|8|0|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
His richly philosophical intellect was not at any time affected by unrealities.|9|0|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
To the substances of terror he was sufficiently alive, but of its shadows he had no apprehension.|10|0|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
His endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into which I had fAllan, were frustrated, in great measure, by certain volumes which I had found in his library.|0|1|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
These were of a character to force into germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition lay latent in my bosom.|1|1|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
I had been reading these books without his knowledge, and thus he was often at a loss to account for the forcible impressions which had been made upon my fancy.|2|1|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
A favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens–a belief which, at this one epoch of my life, I was almost seriously disposed to defend.|0|2|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
On this subject we had long and animated discussions–he maintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters,–I contending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute spontaneity- that is to say, without apparent traces of suggestion–had in itself the unmistakable elements of truth, and was entitled to as much respect as that intuition which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius.|1|2|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
The fact is, that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had occurred to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable, and which had in it so much of the portentous character, that I might well have been excused for regarding it as an omen.|0|3|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
It appalled, and at the same time so confounded and bewildered me, that many days elapsed before I could make up my mind to communicate the circumstances to my friend.|1|3|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
Near the close of exceedingly warm day, I was sitting, book in hand, at an open window, commanding, through a long vista of the river banks, a view of a distant hill, the face of which nearest my position had been denuded by what is termed a land-slide, of the principal portion of its trees.|0|4|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
My thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to the gloom and desolation of the neighboring city.|1|4|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
Uplifting my eyes from the page, they fell upon the naked face of the bill, and upon an object–upon some living monster of hideous conformation, which very rapidly made its way from the summit to the bottom, disappearing finally in the dense forest below.|2|4|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
As this creature first came in sight, I doubted my own sanity–or at least the evidence of my own eyes; and many minutes passed before I succeeded in convincing myself that I was neither mad nor in a dream.|3|4|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
Yet when I described the monster (which I distinctly saw, and calmly surveyed through the whole period of its progress), my readers, I fear, will feel more difficulty in being convinced of these points than even I did myself.|4|4|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
Estimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of the large trees near which it passed–the few giants of the forest which had escaped the fury of the land-slide–I concluded it to be far larger than any ship of the line in existence.|0|5|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
I say ship of the line, because the shape of the monster suggested the idea- the hull of one of our seventy-four might convey a very tolerable conception of the general outline.|1|5|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
The mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of a proboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length, and about as thick as the body of an ordinary elephant.|2|5|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
Near the root of this trunk was an immense quantity of black shaggy hair- more than could have been supplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes; and projecting from this hair downwardly and laterally, sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike those of the wild boar, but of infinitely greater dimensions.|3|5|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
Extending forward, parallel with the proboscis, and on each side of it, was a gigantic staff, thirty or forty feet in length, formed seemingly of pure crystal and in shape a perfect prism,–it reflected in the most gorgeous manner the rays of the declining sun.|4|5|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
The trunk was fashioned like a wedge with the apex to the earth.|5|5|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
From it there were outspread two pairs of wings- each wing nearly one hundred yards in length–one pair being placed above the other, and all thickly covered with metal scales; each scale apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter.|6|5|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
I observed that the upper and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain.|7|5|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
But the chief peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a Death's Head, which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast, and which was as accurately traced in glaring white, upon the dark ground of the body, as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist.|8|5|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
While I regarded the terrific animal, and more especially the appearance on its breast, with a feeling or horror and awe–with a sentiment of forthcoming evil, which I found it impossible to quell by any effort of the reason, I perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis suddenly expand themselves, and from them there proceeded a sound so loud and so expressive of wo, that it struck upon my nerves like a knell and as the monster disappeared at the foot of the hill, I fell at once, fainting, to the floor.|9|5|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
Upon recovering, my first impulse, of course, was to inform my friend of what I had seen and heard–and I can scarcely explain what feeling of repugnance it was which, in the end, operated to prevent me.|0|6|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
At length, one evening, some three or four days after the occurrence, we were sitting together in the room in which I had seen the apparition–I occupying the same seat at the same window, and he lounging on a sofa near at hand.|0|7|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
The association of the place and time impelled me to give him an account of the phenomenon.|1|7|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
He heard me to the end–at first laughed heartily–and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor, as if my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion.|2|7|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
At this instant I again had a distinct view of the monster- to which, with a shout of absolute terror, I now directed his attention.|3|7|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
He looked eagerly–but maintained that he saw nothing- although I designated minutely the course of the creature, as it made its way down the naked face of the hill.|4|7|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
I was now immeasurably alarmed, for I considered the vision either as an omen of my death, or, worse, as the fore-runner of an attack of mania.|0|8|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
I threw myself passionately back in my chair, and for some moments buried my face in my hands.|1|8|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
When I uncovered my eyes, the apparition was no longer apparent.|2|8|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
My host, however, had in some degree resumed the calmness of his demeanor, and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the conformation of the visionary creature.|0|9|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
When I had fully satisfied him on this head, he sighed deeply, as if relieved of some intolerable burden, and went on to talk, with what I thought a cruel calmness, of various points of speculative philosophy, which had heretofore formed subject of discussion between us.|1|9|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
I remember his insisting very especially (among other things) upon the idea that the principle source of error in all human investigations lay in the liability of the understanding to under-rate or to over-value the importance of an object, through mere mis-admeasurement of its propinquity.|2|9|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
"""To estimate properly, for example,"" he said, ""the influence to be exercised on mankind at large by the thorough diffusion of Democracy, the distance of the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly be accomplished should not fail to form an item in the estimate."|3|9|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
"Yet can you tell me one writer on the subject of government who has ever thought this particular branch of the subject worthy of discussion at all""?"|4|9|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
He here paused for a moment, stepped to a book-case, and brought forth one of the ordinary synopses of Natural History.|0|10|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
Requesting me then to exchange seats with him, that he might the better distinguish the fine print of the volume, he took my armchair at the window, and, opening the book, resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before.|1|10|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
"""But for your exceeding minuteness,"" he said, ""in describing the monster, I might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you what it was."|0|11|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
In the first place, let me read to you a schoolboy account of the genus Sphinx, of the family Crepuscularia of the order Lepidoptera, of the class of Insecta–or insects.|1|11|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
"""'Four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic appearance; mouth forming a rolled proboscis, produced by an elongation of the jaws, upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of mandibles and downy palpi; the inferior wings retained to the superior by a stiff hair; antennae in the form of an elongated club, prismatic; abdomen pointed, The Death's–headed Sphinx has occasioned much terror among the vulgar, at times, by the melancholy kind of cry which it utters, and the insignia of death which it wears upon its corslet."|0|12|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
"He here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair, placing himself accurately in the position which I had occupied at the moment of beholding ""the monster""."|0|13|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
"""Ah, here it is,"" he presently exclaimed–""it is reascending the face of the hill, and a very remarkable looking creature I admit it to be."|0|14|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
"Still, it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined it,–for the fact is that, as it wriggles its way up this thread, which some spider has wrought along the window-sash, I find it to be about the sixteenth of an inch in its extreme length, and also about the sixteenth of an inch distant from the pupil of my eye""."|1|14|The Sphinx|January 1846|Satire
THE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, but when he ventured upon insult I vowed revenge.|0|1|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that gave utterance to a threat.|1|1|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
At length I would be avenged; this was a point definitely, settled --but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk.|2|1|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
I must not only punish but punish with impunity.|3|1|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser.|4|1|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.|5|1|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause to doubt my good will.|0|2|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
I continued, as was my in to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my to smile now was at the thought of his immolation.|1|2|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
He had a weak point --this Fortunato --although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared.|0|3|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine.|1|3|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit.|2|3|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity, to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian millionaires.|3|3|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack, but in the matter of old wines he was sincere.|4|3|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
In this respect I did not differ from him materially; --I was skilful in the Italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.|5|3|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season, that I encountered my friend.|0|4|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much.|1|4|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
The man wore motley.|2|4|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells.|3|4|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
I was so pleased to see him that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.|4|4|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"I said to him --""My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met."|0|5|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
How remarkably well you are looking to-day.|1|5|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror

"And as for Luchresi, he cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado""."|4|22|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm; and putting on a mask of black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person, I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.|0|23|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in honour of the time.|0|24|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
I had told them that I should not return until the morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house.|1|24|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.|2|24|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato, bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults.|0|25|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him to be cautious as he followed.|1|25|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
We came at length to the foot of the descent, and stood together upon the damp ground of the catacombs of the Montresors.|2|25|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode.|0|26|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""The pipe,"" he said."|0|27|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""It is farther on,"" said I; ""but observe the white web-work which gleams from these cavern walls""."|0|28|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
He turned towards me, and looked into my eves with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication.|0|29|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""Nitre""?"|0|30|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
he asked, at length.|1|30|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""Nitre,"" I replied."|0|31|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""How long have you had that cough""?"|1|31|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror

My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.|0|33|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""It is nothing,"" he said, at last."|0|34|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""Come,"" I said, with decision, ""we will go back; your health is precious."|0|35|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as once I was.|1|35|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
You are a man to be missed.|2|35|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror

We will go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible.|4|35|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""Enough,"" he said; ""the cough's a mere nothing; it will not kill me."|0|36|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"I shall not die of a cough""."|1|36|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""True --true,"" I replied; ""and, indeed, I had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily --but you should use all proper caution."|0|37|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
A draught of this Medoc will defend us from the damps.|1|37|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould.|0|38|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""Drink,"" I said, presenting him the wine."|0|39|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
He raised it to his lips with a leer.|0|40|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
He paused and nodded to me familiarly, while his bells jingled.|1|40|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""I drink,"" he said, ""to the buried that repose around us""."|0|41|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""And I to your long life""."|0|42|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
He again took my arm, and we proceeded.|0|43|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""These vaults,"" he said, ""are extensive""."|0|44|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror

"""Nemo me impune lacessit""."|0|49|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""Good""!"|0|50|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
he said.|1|50|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled.|0|51|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
My own fancy grew warm with the Medoc.|1|51|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
We had passed through long walls of piled skeletons, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of the catacombs.|2|51|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunato by an arm above the elbow.|3|51|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""The nitre""!"|0|52|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"I said; ""see, it increases."|1|52|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
It hangs like moss upon the vaults.|2|52|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
We are below the river's bed.|3|52|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
The drops of moisture trickle among the bones.|4|52|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
Come, we will go back ere it is too late.|5|52|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""It is nothing,"" he said; ""let us go on."|0|53|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"But first, another draught of the Medoc""."|1|53|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
I broke and reached him a flagon of De Grave.|0|54|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
He emptied it at a breath.|1|54|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
His eyes flashed with a fierce light.|2|54|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
He laughed and threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.|3|54|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
I looked at him in surprise.|0|55|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
He repeated the movement --a grotesque one.|1|55|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""You do not comprehend""?"|0|56|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
he said.|1|56|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""Not I,"" I replied."|0|57|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""Then you are not of the brotherhood""."|0|58|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""How""?"|0|59|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""You are not of the masons""."|0|60|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""Yes, yes,"" I said; ""yes, yes""."|0|61|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""You?"|0|62|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
Impossible!|1|62|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"A mason""?"|2|62|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""A mason,"" I replied."|0|63|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""A sign,"" he said, ""a sign""."|0|64|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""It is this,"" I answered, producing from beneath the folds of my roquelaire a trowel."|0|65|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""You jest,"" he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces."|0|66|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""But let us proceed to the Amontillado""."|1|66|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""Be it so,"" I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again offering him my arm."|0|67|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
He leaned upon it heavily.|1|67|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
We continued our route in search of the Amontillado.|2|67|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
We passed through a range of low arches, descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame.|3|67|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious.|0|68|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris.|1|68|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
Three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner.|2|68|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
From the fourth side the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size.|3|68|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we perceived a still interior crypt or recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in height six or seven.|4|68|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
It seemed to have been constructed for no especial use within itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite.|5|68|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavoured to pry into the depth of the recess.|0|69|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
Its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see.|1|69|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""Proceed,"" I said; ""herein is the Amontillado."|0|70|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""He is an ignoramus,"" interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily forward, while I followed immediately at his heels."|0|71|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
In niche, and finding an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered.|1|71|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
A moment more and I had fettered him to the granite.|2|71|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
In its surface were two iron staples, distant from each other about two feet, horizontally.|3|71|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
From one of these depended a short chain, from the other a padlock.|4|71|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
Throwing the links about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it.|5|71|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
He was too much astounded to resist.|6|71|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the recess.|7|71|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""Pass your hand,"" I said, ""over the wall; you cannot help feeling the nitre."|0|72|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
Indeed, it is very damp.|1|72|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
Once more let me implore you to return.|2|72|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
No?|3|72|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
Then I must positively leave you.|4|72|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"But I must first render you all the little attentions in my power""."|5|72|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""The Amontillado""!"|0|73|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his astonishment.|1|73|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""True,"" I replied; ""the Amontillado""."|0|74|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which I have before spoken.|0|75|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity of building stone and mortar.|1|75|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
With these materials and with the aid of my trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.|2|75|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
I had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I discovered that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off.|0|76|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
The earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess.|1|76|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
It was not the cry of a drunken man.|2|76|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
There was then a long and obstinate silence.|3|76|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
I laid the second tier, and the third, and the fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain.|4|76|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
The noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labours and sat down upon the bones.|5|76|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel, and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh tier.|6|76|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast.|7|76|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
I again paused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within.|8|76|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back.|0|77|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
For a brief moment I hesitated, I trembled.|1|77|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
Unsheathing my rapier, I began to grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant reassured me.|2|77|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt satisfied.|3|77|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
I reapproached the wall; I replied to the yells of him who clamoured.|4|77|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
I re-echoed, I aided, I surpassed them in volume and in strength.|5|77|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
I did this, and the clamourer grew still.|6|77|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close.|0|78|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
I had completed the eighth, the ninth and the tenth tier.|1|78|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
I had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in.|2|78|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
I struggled with its weight; I placed it partially in its destined position.|3|78|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
But now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head.|4|78|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
It was succeeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognizing as that of the noble Fortunato.|5|78|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror
"""Ha!"|0|79|The Cask Of Amontillado|November 1846|Horror

TO THE EDITORS OF THE LADY'S BOOK: I have the honor of sending you, for your magazine, an article which I hope you will be able to comprehend rather more distinctly than I do myself.|0|0|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"It is a translation, by my friend, Martin Van Buren Mavis, (sometimes called the ""Toughkeepsie Seer"") of an odd-looking MS."|1|0|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
which I found, about a year ago, tightly corked up in a jug floating in the Mare Tenebrarum–a sea well described by the Nubian geographer, but seldom visited now-a-days, except for the transcendentalists and divers for crotchets.|2|0|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
NOW, my dear friend–now, for your sins, you are to suffer the infliction of a long gossiping letter.|0|4|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
I tell you distinctly that I am going to punish you for all your impertinences by being as tedious, as discursive, as incoherent and as unsatisfactory as possible.|1|4|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Besides, here I am, cooped up in a dirty balloon, with some one or two hundred of the canaille, all bound on a pleasure excursion, (what a funny idea some people have of pleasure!|2|4|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
) and I have no prospect of touching terra firma for a month at least.|3|4|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Nobody to talk to.|4|4|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Nothing to do.|5|4|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
When one has nothing to do, then is the time to correspond with ones friends.|6|4|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
You perceive, then, why it is that I write you this letter–it is on account of my ennui and your sins.|7|4|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Get ready your spectacles and make up your mind to be annoyed.|0|5|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
I mean to write at you every day during this odious voyage.|1|5|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Heigho!|0|6|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
when will any Invention visit the human pericranium?|1|6|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Are we forever to be doomed to the thousand inconveniences of the balloon?|2|6|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Will nobody contrive a more expeditious mode of progress?|3|6|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
The jog-trot movement, to my thinking, is little less than positive torture.|4|6|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Upon my word we have not made more than a hundred miles the hour since leaving home!|5|6|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
The very birds beat us–at least some of them.|6|6|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
I assure you that I do not exaggerate at all.|7|6|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Our motion, no doubt, seems slower than it actually is–this on account of our having no objects about us by which to estimate our velocity, and on account of our going with the wind.|8|6|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
To be sure, whenever we meet a balloon we have a chance of perceiving our rate, and then, I admit, things do not appear so very bad.|9|6|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Accustomed as I am to this mode of travelling, I cannot get over a kind of giddiness whenever a balloon passes us in a current directly overhead.|10|6|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
It always seems to me like an immense bird of prey about to pounce upon us and carry us off in its claws.|11|6|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
One went over us this morning about sunrise, and so nearly overhead that its drag-rope actually brushed the network suspending our car, and caused us very serious apprehension.|12|6|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"Our captain said that if the material of the bag had been the trumpery varnished ""silk"" of five hundred or a thousand years ago, we should inevitably have been damaged."|13|6|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
This silk, as he explained it to me, was a fabric composed of the entrails of a species of earth-worm.|14|6|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
The worm was carefully fed on mulberries–kind of fruit resembling a water-melon–and, when sufficiently fat, was crushed in a mill.|15|6|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"The paste thus arising was called papyrus in its primary state, and went through a variety of processes until it finally became ""silk""."|16|6|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Singular to relate, it was once much admired as an article of female dress!|17|6|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Balloons were also very generally constructed from it.|18|6|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
A better kind of material, it appears, was subsequently found in the down surrounding the seed-vessels of a plant vulgarly called euphorbium, and at that time botanically termed milk-weed.|19|6|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
This latter kind of silk was designated as silk-buckingham, on account of its superior durability, and was usually prepared for use by being varnished with a solution of gum caoutchouc–a substance which in some respects must have resembled the gutta percha now in common use.|20|6|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
This caoutchouc was occasionally called Indian rubber or rubber of twist, and was no doubt one of the numerous fungi.|21|6|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Never tell me again that I am not at heart an antiquarian.|22|6|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Talking of drag-ropes–our own, it seems, has this moment knocked a man overboard from one of the small magnetic propellers that swarm in ocean below us–a boat of about six thousand tons, and, from all accounts, shamefully crowded.|0|7|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
These diminutive barques should be prohibited from carrying more than a definite number of passengers.|1|7|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
The man, of course, was not permitted to get on board again, and was soon out of sight, he and his life-preserver.|2|7|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
I rejoice, my dear friend, that we live in an age so enlightened that no such a thing as an individual is supposed to exist.|3|7|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
It is the mass for which the true Humanity cares.|4|7|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
By-the-by, talking of Humanity, do you know that our immortal Wiggins is not so original in his views of the Social Condition and so forth, as his contemporaries are inclined to suppose?|5|7|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Pundit assures me that the same ideas were put nearly in the same way, about a thousand years ago, by an Irish philosopher called Furrier, on account of his keeping a retail shop for cat peltries and other furs.|6|7|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Pundit knows, you know; there can be no mistake about it.|7|7|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"How very wonderfully do we see verified every day, the profound observation of the Hindoo Aries Tottle (as quoted by Pundit)–""Thus must we say that, not once or twice, or a few times, but with almost infinite repetitions, the same opinions come round in a circle among men""."|8|7|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
April 2.|0|8|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
–Spoke to-day the magnetic cutter in charge of the middle section of floating telegraph wires.|1|8|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
I learn that when this species of telegraph was first put into operation by Horse, it was considered quite impossible to convey the wires over sea, but now we are at a loss to comprehend where the difficulty lay!|2|8|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
So wags the world.|3|8|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Tempora mutantur–excuse me for quoting the Etruscan.|4|8|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
What would we do without the Atalantic telegraph?|5|8|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
(Pundit says Atlantic was the ancient adjective.|6|8|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
) We lay to a few minutes to ask the cutter some questions, and learned, among other glorious news, that civil war is raging in Africa, while the plague is doing its good work beautifully both in Yurope and Ayesher.|7|8|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Is it not truly remarkable that, before the magnificent light shed upon philosophy by Humanity, the world was accustomed to regard War and Pestilence as calamities?|8|8|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Do you know that prayers were actually offered up in the ancient temples to the end that these evils (!|9|8|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
) might not be visited upon mankind?|10|8|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Is it not really difficult to comprehend upon what principle of interest our forefathers acted?|11|8|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Were they so blind as not to perceive that the destruction of a myriad of individuals is only so much positive advantage to the mass!|12|8|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
April 3.|0|9|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
–It is really a very fine amusement to ascend the rope-ladder leading to the summit of the balloon-bag, and thence survey the surrounding world.|1|9|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
From the car below you know the prospect is not so comprehensive–you can see little vertically.|2|9|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
But seated here (where I write this) in the luxuriously-cushioned open piazza of the summit, one can see everything that is going on in all directions.|3|9|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Just now there is quite a crowd of balloons in sight, and they present a very animated appearance, while the air is resonant with the hum of so many millions of human voices.|4|9|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
I have heard it asserted that when Yellow or (Pundit will have it) Violet, who is supposed to have been the first aeronaut, maintained the practicability of traversing the atmosphere in all directions, by merely ascending or descending until a favorable current was attained, he was scarcely hearkened to at all by his contemporaries, who looked upon him as merely an ingenious sort of madman, because the philosophers (?|5|9|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
) of the day declared the thing impossible.|6|9|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Really now it does seem to me quite unaccountable how any thing so obviously feasible could have escaped the sagacity of the ancient savans.|7|9|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
But in all ages the great obstacles to advancement in Art have been opposed by the so-called men of science.|8|9|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
To be sure, our men of science are not quite so bigoted as those of old:–oh, I have something so queer to tell you on this topic.|9|9|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Do you know that it is not more than a thousand years ago since the metaphysicians consented to relieve the people of the singular fancy that there existed but two possible roads for the attainment of Truth!|10|9|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Believe it if you can!|11|9|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
It appears that long, long ago, in the night of Time, there lived a Turkish philosopher (or Hindoo possibly) called Aries Tottle.|12|9|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
This person introduced, or at all events propagated what was termed the deductive or a priori mode of investigation.|13|9|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"He started with what he maintained to be axioms or ""self-evident truths,"" and thence proceeded ""logically"" to results."|14|9|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
His greatest disciples were one Neuclid, and one Cant.|15|9|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"Well, Aries Tottle flourished supreme until advent of one Hog, surnamed the ""Ettrick Shepherd,"" who preached an entirely different system, which he called the a posteriori or inductive."|16|9|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
His plan referred altogether to Sensation.|17|9|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
He proceeded by observing, analyzing, and classifying facts-instantiae naturae, as they were affectedly called–into general laws.|18|9|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Aries Tottle's mode, in a word, was based on noumena; Hog's on phenomena.|19|9|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Well, so great was the admiration excited by this latter system that, at its first introduction, Aries Tottle fell into disrepute; but finally he recovered ground and was permitted to divide the realm of Truth with his more modern rival.|20|9|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
The savans now maintained the Aristotelian and Baconian roads were the sole possible avenues to knowledge.|21|9|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"""Baconian,"" you must know, was an adjective invented as equivalent to Hog-ian and more euphonious and dignified."|22|9|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Now, my dear friend, I do assure you, most positively, that I represent this matter fairly, on the soundest authority and you can easily understand how a notion so absurd on its very face must have operated to retard the progress of all true knowledge–which makes its advances almost invariably by intuitive bounds.|0|10|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
The ancient idea confined investigations to crawling; and for hundreds of years so great was the infatuation about Hog especially, that a virtual end was put to all thinking, properly so called.|1|10|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
No man dared utter a truth to which he felt himself indebted to his Soul alone.|2|10|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
It mattered not whether the truth was even demonstrably a truth, for the bullet-headed savans of the time regarded only the road by which he had attained it.|3|10|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
They would not even look at the end.|4|10|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"""Let us see the means,"" they cried, ""the means""!"|5|10|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"If, upon investigation of the means, it was found to come under neither the category Aries (that is to say Ram) nor under the category Hog, why then the savans went no farther, but pronounced the ""theorist"" a fool, and would have nothing to do with him or his truth."|6|10|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Now, it cannot be maintained, even, that by the crawling system the greatest amount of truth would be attained in any long series of ages, for the repression of imagination was an evil not to be compensated for by any superior certainty in the ancient modes of investigation.|0|11|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
The error of these Jurmains, these Vrinch, these Inglitch, and these Amriccans (the latter, by the way, were our own immediate progenitors), was an error quite analogous with that of the wiseacre who fancies that he must necessarily see an object the better the more closely he holds it to his eyes.|1|11|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
These people blinded themselves by details.|2|11|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"When they proceeded Hoggishly, their ""facts"" were by no means always facts–a matter of little consequence had it not been for assuming that they were facts and must be facts because they appeared to be such."|3|11|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
When they proceeded on the path of the Ram, their course was scarcely as straight as a ram's horn, for they never had an axiom which was an axiom at all.|4|11|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"They must have been very blind not to see this, even in their own day; for even in their own day many of the long ""established"" axioms had been rejected."|5|11|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"For example–""Ex nihilo nihil fit""; ""a body cannot act where it is not""; ""there cannot exist antipodes""; ""darkness cannot come out of light""–all these, and a dozen other similar propositions, formerly admitted without hesitation as axioms, were, even at the period of which I speak, seen to be untenable."|6|11|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"How absurd in these people, then, to persist in putting faith in ""axioms"" as immutable bases of Truth!"|7|11|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
But even out of the mouths of their soundest reasoners it is easy to demonstrate the futility, the impalpability of their axioms in general.|8|11|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Who was the soundest of their logicians?|9|11|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Let me see!|10|11|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
I will go and ask Pundit and be back in a minute.|11|11|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Ah, here we have it!|15|11|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Here is a book written nearly a thousand years ago and lately translated from the Inglitch–which, by the way, appears to have been the rudiment of the Amriccan.|16|11|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Pundit says it is decidedly the cleverest ancient work on its topic, Logic.|17|11|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
The author (who was much thought of in his day) was one Miller, or Mill; and we find it recorded of him, as a point of some importance, that he had a mill-horse called Bentham.|18|11|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
But let us glance at the treatise!|19|11|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Ah!|0|12|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"–""Ability or inability to conceive,"" says Mr. Mill, very properly, ""is in no case to be received as a criterion of axiomatic truth""."|1|12|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
What modern in his senses would ever think of disputing this truism?|2|12|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
The only wonder with us must be, how it happened that Mr. Mill conceived it necessary even to hint at any thing so obvious.|3|12|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
So far good–but let us turn over another paper.|4|12|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
What have we here?|5|12|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"- ""Contradictories cannot both be true–that is, cannot co-exist in nature""."|6|12|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Here Mr. Mill means, for example, that a tree must be either a tree or not a tree–that it cannot be at the same time a tree and not a tree.|7|12|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Very well; but I ask him why.|8|12|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"His reply is this–and never pretends to be any thing else than this–""Because it is impossible to conceive that contradictories can both be true""."|9|12|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"But this is no answer at all, by his own showing, for has he not just admitted as a truism that ""ability or inability to conceive is in no case to be received as a criterion of axiomatic truth""."|10|12|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Now I do not complain of these ancients so much because their logic is, by their own showing, utterly baseless, worthless and fantastic altogether, as because of their pompous and imbecile proscription of all other roads of Truth, of all other means for its attainment than the two preposterous paths–the one of creeping and the one of crawling–to which they have dared to confine the Soul that loves nothing so well as to soar.|0|13|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
By the by, my dear friend, do you not think it would have puzzled these ancient dogmaticians to have determined by which of their two roads it was that the most important and most sublime of all their truths was, in effect, attained?|0|14|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
I mean the truth of Gravitation.|1|14|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Newton owed it to Kepler.|2|14|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Kepler admitted that his three laws were guessed at–these three laws of all laws which led the great Inglitch mathematician to his principle, the basis of all physical principle–to go behind which we must enter the Kingdom of Metaphysics.|3|14|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Kepler guessed–that is to say imagined.|4|14|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"He was essentially a ""theorist""–that word now of so much sanctity, formerly an epithet of contempt."|5|14|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"Would it not have puzzled these old moles too, to have explained by which of the two ""roads"" a cryptographist unriddles a cryptograph of more than usual secrecy, or by which of the two roads Champollion directed mankind to those enduring and almost innumerable truths which resulted from his deciphering the Hieroglyphics."|6|14|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
One word more on this topic and I will be done boring you.|0|15|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Is it not passing strange that, with their eternal prattling about roads to Truth, these bigoted people missed what we now so clearly perceive to be the great highway–that of Consistency?|1|15|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Does it not seem singular how they should have failed to deduce from the works of God the vital fact that a perfect consistency must be an absolute truth!|2|15|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
How plain has been our progress since the late announcement of this proposition!|3|15|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Investigation has been taken out of the hands of the ground-moles and given, as a task, to the true and only true thinkers, the men of ardent imagination.|4|15|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
These latter theorize.|5|15|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Can you not fancy the shout of scorn with which my words would be received by our progenitors were it possible for them to be now looking over my shoulder?|6|15|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
These men, I say, theorize; and their theories are simply corrected, reduced, systematized–cleared, little by little, of their dross of inconsistency–until, finally, a perfect consistency stands apparent which even the most stolid admit, because it is a consistency, to be an absolute and an unquestionable truth.|7|15|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
April 4.|0|16|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
–The new gas is doing wonders, in conjunction with the new improvement with gutta percha.|1|16|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
How very safe, commodious, manageable, and in every respect convenient are our modern balloons!|2|16|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Here is an immense one approaching us at the rate of at least a hundred and fifty miles an hour.|3|16|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
It seems to be crowded with people- perhaps there are three or four hundred passengers–and yet it soars to an elevation of nearly a mile, looking down upon poor us with sovereign contempt.|4|16|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Still a hundred or even two hundred miles an hour is slow travelling after all.|5|16|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Do you remember our flight on the railroad across the Kanadaw continent?|6|16|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
–fully three hundred miles the hour–that was travelling.|7|16|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Nothing to be seen though–nothing to be done but flirt, feast and dance in the magnificent saloons.|8|16|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Do you remember what an odd sensation was experienced when, by chance, we caught a glimpse of external objects while the cars were in full flight?|9|16|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Every thing seemed unique–in one mass.|10|16|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
For my part, I cannot say but that I preferred the travelling by the slow train of a hundred miles the hour.|11|16|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Here we were permitted to have glass windows–even to have them open–and something like a distinct view of the country was attainable.|12|16|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Pundit says that the route for the great Kanadaw railroad must have been in some measure marked out about nine hundred years ago!|16|16|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
In fact, he goes so far as to assert that actual traces of a road are still discernible–traces referable to a period quite as remote as that mentioned.|17|16|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
The track, it appears was double only; ours, you know, has twelve paths; and three or four new ones are in preparation.|18|16|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
The ancient rails were very slight, and placed so close together as to be, according to modern notions, quite frivolous, if not dangerous in the extreme.|19|16|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
The present width of track–fifty feet–is considered, indeed, scarcely secure enough.|20|16|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
For my part, I make no doubt that a track of some sort must have existed in very remote times, as Pundit asserts; for nothing can be clearer, to my mind, than that, at some period–not less than seven centuries ago, certainly–the Northern and Southern Kanadaw continents were united; the Kanawdians, then, would have been driven, by necessity, to a great railroad across the continent.|21|16|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
April 5.|0|17|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
–I am almost devoured by ennui.|1|17|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Pundit is the only conversible person on board; and he, poor soul!|2|17|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
can speak of nothing but antiquities.|3|17|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
He has been occupied all the day in the attempt to convince me that the ancient Amriccans governed themselves!|4|17|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
–did ever anybody hear of such an absurdity?|5|17|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"–that they existed in a sort of every-man-for-himself confederacy, after the fashion of the ""prairie dogs"" that we read of in fable."|6|17|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
He says that they started with the queerest idea conceivable, viz: that all men are born free and equal–this in the very teeth of the laws of gradation so visibly impressed upon all things both in the moral and physical universe.|7|17|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"Every man ""voted,"" as they called it–that is to say meddled with public affairs–until at length, it was discovered that what is everybody's business is nobody's, and that the ""Republic"" (so the absurd thing was called) was without a government at all."|8|17|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"It is related, however, that the first circumstance which disturbed, very particularly, the self-complacency of the philosophers who constructed this ""Republic,"" was the startling discovery that universal suffrage gave opportunity for fraudulent schemes, by means of which any desired number of votes might at any time be polled, without the possibility of prevention or even detection, by any party which should be merely villainous enough not to be ashamed of the fraud."|9|17|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
A little reflection upon this discovery sufficed to render evident the consequences, which were that rascality must predominate–in a word, that a republican government could never be any thing but a rascally one.|10|17|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
While the philosophers, however, were busied in blushing at their stupidity in not having foreseen these inevitable evils, and intent upon the invention of new theories, the matter was put to an abrupt issue by a fellow of the name of Mob, who took every thing into his own hands and set up a despotism, in comparison with which those of the fabulous Zeros and Hellofagabaluses were respectable and delectable.|11|17|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
This Mob (a foreigner, by-the-by), is said to have been the most odious of all men that ever encumbered the earth.|12|17|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
He was a giant in stature–insolent, rapacious, filthy, had the gall of a bullock with the heart of a hyena and the brains of a peacock.|13|17|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
He died, at length, by dint of his own energies, which exhausted him.|14|17|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Nevertheless, he had his uses, as every thing has, however vile, and taught mankind a lesson which to this day it is in no danger of forgetting–never to run directly contrary to the natural analogies.|15|17|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"As for Republicanism, no analogy could be found for it upon the face of the earth–unless we except the case of the ""prairie dogs,"" an exception which seems to demonstrate, if anything, that democracy is a very admirable form of government–for dogs."|16|17|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
April 6.|0|18|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
–Last night had a fine view of Alpha Lyrae, whose disk, through our captain's spy-glass, subtends an angle of half a degree, looking very much as our sun does to the naked eye on a misty day.|1|18|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Alpha Lyrae, although so very much larger than our sun, by the by, resembles him closely as regards its spots, its atmosphere, and in many other particulars.|2|18|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
It is only within the last century, Pundit tells me, that the binary relation existing between these two orbs began even to be suspected.|3|18|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
The evident motion of our system in the heavens was (strange to say!|4|18|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
) referred to an orbit about a prodigious star in the centre of the galaxy.|5|18|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
About this star, or at all events about a centre of gravity common to all the globes of the Milky Way and supposed to be near Alcyone in the Pleiades, every one of these globes was declared to be revolving, our own performing the circuit in a period of 117,000,000 of years!|6|18|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
We, with our present lights, our vast telescopic improvements, and so forth, of course find it difficult to comprehend the ground of an idea such as this.|7|18|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Its first propagator was one Mudler.|8|18|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
He was led, we must presume, to this wild hypothesis by mere analogy in the first instance; but, this being the case, he should have at least adhered to analogy in its development.|9|18|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
A great central orb was, in fact, suggested; so far Mudler was consistent.|10|18|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
This central orb, however, dynamically, should have been greater than all its surrounding orbs taken together.|11|18|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"The question might then have been asked–""Why do we not see it""?"|12|18|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
- we, especially, who occupy the mid region of the cluster–the very locality near which, at least, must be situated this inconceivable central sun.|13|18|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
The astronomer, perhaps, at this point, took refuge in the suggestion of non-luminosity; and here analogy was suddenly let fall.|14|18|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
But even admitting the central orb non-luminous, how did he manage to explain its failure to be rendered visible by the incalculable host of glorious suns glaring in all directions about it?|15|18|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
No doubt what he finally maintained was merely a centre of gravity common to all the revolving orbs–but here again analogy must have been let fall.|16|18|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Our system revolves, it is true, about a common centre of gravity, but it does this in connection with and in consequence of a material sun whose mass more than counterbalances the rest of the system.|17|18|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
The mathematical circle is a curve composed of an infinity of straight lines; but this idea of the circle–this idea of it which, in regard to all earthly geometry, we consider as merely the mathematical, in contradistinction from the practical, idea–is, in sober fact, the practical conception which alone we have any right to entertain in respect to those Titanic circles with which we have to deal, at least in fancy, when we suppose our system, with its fellows, revolving about a point in the centre of the galaxy.|18|18|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Let the most vigorous of human imaginations but attempt to take a single step toward the comprehension of a circuit so unutterable!|19|18|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
I would scarcely be paradoxical to say that a flash of lightning itself, travelling forever upon the circumference of this inconceivable circle, would still forever be travelling in a straight line.|20|18|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
That the path of our sun along such a circumference- that the direction of our system in such an orbit–would, to any human perception, deviate in the slightest degree from a straight line even in a million of years, is a proposition not to be entertained; and yet these ancient astronomers were absolutely cajoled, it appears, into believing that a decisive curvature had become apparent during the brief period of their astronomical history–during the mere point- during the utter nothingness of two or three thousand years!|21|18|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
How incomprehensible, that considerations such as this did not at once indicate to them the true state of affairs–that of the binary revolution of our sun and Alpha Lyrae around a common centre of gravity!|22|18|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
April 7.|0|19|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
–Continued last night our astronomical amusements.|1|19|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Had a fine view of the five Neptunian asteroids, and watched with much interest the putting up of a huge impost on a couple of lintels in the new temple at Daphnis in the moon.|2|19|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
It was amusing to think that creatures so diminutive as the lunarians, and bearing so little resemblance to humanity, yet evinced a mechanical ingenuity so much superior to our own.|3|19|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
One finds it difficult, too, to conceive the vast masses which these people handle so easily, to be as light as our own reason tells us they actually are.|4|19|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
April 8.|0|20|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
–Eureka!|1|20|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Pundit is in his glory.|2|20|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
A balloon from Kanadaw spoke us to-day and threw on board several late papers; they contain some exceedingly curious information relative to Kanawdian or rather Amriccan antiquities.|3|20|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
You know, I presume, that laborers have for some months been employed in preparing the ground for a new fountain at Paradise, the Emperor's principal pleasure garden.|4|20|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Paradise, it appears, has been, literally speaking, an island time out of mind- that is to say, its northern boundary was always (as far back as any record extends) a rivulet, or rather a very narrow arm of the sea.|5|20|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
This arm was gradually widened until it attained its present breadth–a mile.|6|20|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
The whole length of the island is nine miles; the breadth varies materially.|7|20|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
The entire area (so Pundit says) was, about eight hundred years ago, densely packed with houses, some of them twenty stories high; land (for some most unaccountable reason) being considered as especially precious just in this vicinity.|8|20|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
The disastrous earthquake, however, of the year 2050, so totally uprooted and overwhelmed the town (for it was almost too large to be called a village) that the most indefatigable of our antiquarians have never yet been able to obtain from the site any sufficient data (in the shape of coins, medals or inscriptions) wherewith to build up even the ghost of a theory concerning the manners, customs, &amp;c.|9|20|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
, &amp;c.|10|20|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
, &amp;c.|11|20|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
, of the aboriginal inhabitants.|12|20|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Nearly all that we have hitherto known of them is, that they were a portion of the Knickerbocker tribe of savages infesting the continent at its first discovery by Recorder Riker, a knight of the Golden Fleece.|13|20|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
They were by no means uncivilized, however, but cultivated various arts and even sciences after a fashion of their own.|14|20|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"It is related of them that they were acute in many respects, but were oddly afflicted with monomania for building what, in the ancient Amriccan, was denominated ""churches""- a kind of pagoda instituted for the worship of two idols that went by the names of Wealth and Fashion."|15|20|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
In the end, it is said, the island became, nine tenths of it, church.|16|20|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
The women, too, it appears, were oddly deformed by a natural protuberance of the region just below the small of the back–although, most unaccountably, this deformity was looked upon altogether in the light of a beauty.|17|20|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
One or two pictures of these singular women have in fact, been miraculously preserved.|18|20|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
They look very odd, very–like something between a turkey-cock and a dromedary.|19|20|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Well, these few details are nearly all that have descended to us respecting the ancient Knickerbockers.|0|21|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
It seems, however, that while digging in the centre of the emperors garden, (which, you know, covers the whole island), some of the workmen unearthed a cubical and evidently chiseled block of granite, weighing several hundred pounds.|1|21|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
It was in good preservation, having received, apparently, little injury from the convulsion which entombed it.|2|21|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
On one of its surfaces was a marble slab with (only think of it!|3|21|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
) an inscription- a legible inscription.|4|21|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Pundit is in ecstacies.|5|21|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Upon detaching the slab, a cavity appeared, containing a leaden box filled with various coins, a long scroll of names, several documents which appear to resemble newspapers, with other matters of intense interest to the antiquarian!|6|21|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
There can be no doubt that all these are genuine Amriccan relics belonging to the tribe called Knickerbocker.|7|21|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
The papers thrown on board our balloon are filled with fac-similes of the coins, MSS.|8|21|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
, typography, &amp;c.|9|21|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
, &amp;c.|10|21|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
This, as I give it, is a verbatim translation done by Pundit himself, so there can be no mistake about it.|0|23|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"From the few words thus preserved, we glean several important items of knowledge, not the least interesting of which is the fact that a thousand years ago actual monuments had fAllan into disuse–as was all very proper–the people contenting themselves, as we do now, with a mere indication of the design to erect a monument at some future time; a corner-stone being cautiously laid by itself ""solitary and alone"" (excuse me for quoting the great American poet Benton!"|1|23|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
), as a guarantee of the magnanimous intention.|2|23|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
We ascertain, too, very distinctly, from this admirable inscription, the how as well as the where and the what, of the great surrender in question.|3|23|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
As to the where, it was Yorktown (wherever that was), and as to the what, it was General Cornwallis (no doubt some wealthy dealer in corn).|4|23|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
He was surrendered.|5|23|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
The inscription commemorates the surrender of–what?|6|23|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"why, ""of Lord Cornwallis""."|7|23|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
The only question is what could the savages wish him surrendered for.|8|23|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
But when we remember that these savages were undoubtedly cannibals, we are led to the conclusion that they intended him for sausage.|9|23|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
As to the how of the surrender, no language can be more explicit.|10|23|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
"Lord Cornwallis was surrendered (for sausage) ""under the auspices of the Washington Monument Association""–no doubt a charitable institution for the depositing of corner-stones."|11|23|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
–But, Heaven bless me!|12|23|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
what is the matter?|13|23|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Ah, I see–the balloon has collapsed, and we shall have a tumble into the sea.|14|23|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
I have, therefore, only time enough to add that, from a hasty inspection of the fac-similes of newspapers, &amp;c.|15|23|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
, &amp;c.|16|23|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
, I find that the great men in those days among the Amriccans, were one John, a smith, and one Zacchary, a tailor.|17|23|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Good-bye, until I see you again.|0|24|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Whether you ever get this letter or not is point of little importance, as I write altogether for my own amusement.|1|24|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
I shall cork the MS.|2|24|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
up in a bottle, however, and throw it into the sea.|3|24|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
Yours everlastingly, PUNDITA.|0|25|Mellonta Tauta|February 1849|Science fiction / Hoax
I NEVER knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was.|0|0|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
He seemed to live only for joking.|1|0|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
To tell a good story of the joke kind, and to tell it well, was the surest road to his favor.|2|0|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Thus it happened that his seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers.|3|0|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
They all took after the king, too, in being large, corpulent, oily men, as well as inimitable jokers.|4|0|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Whether people grow fat by joking, or whether there is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke, I have never been quite able to determine; but certain it is that a lean joker is a rara avis in terris.|5|0|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
About the refinements, or, as he called them, the 'ghost' of wit, the king troubled himself very little.|0|1|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
He had an especial admiration for breadth in a jest, and would often put up with length, for the sake of it.|1|1|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Over-niceties wearied him.|2|1|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
He would have preferred Rabelais' 'Gargantua' to the 'Zadig' of Voltaire: and, upon the whole, practical jokes suited his taste far better than verbal ones.|3|1|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
At the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not altogether gone out of fashion at court.|0|2|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Several of the great continental 'powers' still retain their 'fools,' who wore motley, with caps and bells, and who were expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms, at a moment's notice, in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table.|1|2|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Our king, as a matter of course, retained his 'fool.|0|3|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
' The fact is, he required something in the way of folly–if only to counterbalance the heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers–not to mention himself.|1|3|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
His fool, or professional jester, was not only a fool, however.|0|4|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
His value was trebled in the eyes of the king, by the fact of his being also a dwarf and a cripple.|1|4|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Dwarfs were as common at court, in those days, as fools; and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through their days (days are rather longer at court than elsewhere) without both a jester to laugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at.|2|4|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
But, as I have already observed, your jesters, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, are fat, round, and unwieldy–so that it was no small source of self-gratulation with our king that, in Hop-Frog (this was the fool's name), he possessed a triplicate treasure in one person.|3|4|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
I believe the name 'Hop-Frog' was not that given to the dwarf by his sponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by general consent of the several ministers, on account of his inability to walk as other men do.|0|5|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
In fact, Hop-Frog could only get along by a sort of interjectional gait–something between a leap and a wriggle–a movement that afforded illimitable amusement, and of course consolation, to the king, for (notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional swelling of the head) the king, by his whole court, was accounted a capital figure.|1|5|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
But although Hop-Frog, through the distortion of his legs, could move only with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor, the prodigious muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms, by way of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled him to perform many feats of wonderful dexterity, where trees or ropes were in question, or any thing else to climb.|0|6|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
At such exercises he certainly much more resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a frog.|1|6|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
I am not able to say, with precision, from what country Hop-Frog originally came.|0|7|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
It was from some barbarous region, however, that no person ever heard of–a vast distance from the court of our king.|1|7|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Hop-Frog, and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself (although of exquisite proportions, and a marvellous dancer), had been forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces, and sent as presents to the king, by one of his ever-victorious generals.|2|7|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that a close intimacy arose between the two little captives.|0|8|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Indeed, they soon became sworn friends.|1|8|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Hop-Frog, who, although he made a great deal of sport, was by no means popular, had it not in his power to render Trippetta many services; but she, on account of her grace and exquisite beauty (although a dwarf), was universally admired and petted; so she possessed much influence; and never failed to use it, whenever she could, for the benefit of Hop-Frog.|2|8|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
On some grand state occasion–I forgot what–the king determined to have a masquerade, and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind, occurred at our court, then the talents, both of Hop-Frog and Trippetta were sure to be called into play.|0|9|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Hop-Frog, in especial, was so inventive in the way of getting up pageants, suggesting novel characters, and arranging costumes, for masked balls, that nothing could be done, it seems, without his assistance.|1|9|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
The night appointed for the fete had arrived.|0|10|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
A gorgeous hall had been fitted up, under Trippetta's eye, with every kind of device which could possibly give eclat to a masquerade.|1|10|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
The whole court was in a fever of expectation.|2|10|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
As for costumes and characters, it might well be supposed that everybody had come to a decision on such points.|3|10|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Many had made up their minds (as to what roles they should assume) a week, or even a month, in advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision anywhere–except in the case of the king and his seven minsters.|4|10|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Why they hesitated I never could tell, unless they did it by way of a joke.|5|10|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
More probably, they found it difficult, on account of being so fat, to make up their minds.|6|10|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
At all events, time flew; and, as a last resort they sent for Trippetta and Hop-Frog.|7|10|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
When the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found him sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council; but the monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor.|0|11|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
He knew that Hop-Frog was not fond of wine, for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness; and madness is no comfortable feeling.|1|11|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
But the king loved his practical jokes, and took pleasure in forcing Hop-Frog to drink and (as the king called it) 'to be merry.|2|11|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""Come here, Hop-Frog,"" said he, as the jester and his friend entered the room; ""swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends, [here Hop-Frog sighed,] and then let us have the benefit of your invention."|0|12|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
We want characters–characters, man–something novel–out of the way.|1|12|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
We are wearied with this everlasting sameness.|2|12|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Come, drink!|3|12|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"the wine will brighten your wits""."|4|12|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Hop-Frog endeavored, as usual, to get up a jest in reply to these advances from the king; but the effort was too much.|0|13|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
It happened to be the poor dwarf's birthday, and the command to drink to his 'absent friends' forced the tears to his eyes.|1|13|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Many large, bitter drops fell into the goblet as he took it, humbly, from the hand of the tyrant.|2|13|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""Ah!"|0|14|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
ha!|1|14|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"ha""!"|2|14|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
roared the latter, as the dwarf reluctantly drained the beaker.|3|14|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"–""See what a glass of good wine can do!"|4|14|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"Why, your eyes are shining already""!"|5|14|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Poor fellow!|0|15|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
his large eyes gleamed, rather than shone; for the effect of wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous.|1|15|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
He placed the goblet nervously on the table, and looked round upon the company with a half–insane stare.|2|15|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
They all seemed highly amused at the success of the king's 'joke.|3|15|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""And now to business,"" said the prime minister, a very fat man."|0|16|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""Yes,"" said the King; ""Come lend us your assistance."|0|17|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Characters, my fine fellow; we stand in need of characters–all of us–ha!|1|17|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
ha!|2|17|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"ha""!"|3|17|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
and as this was seriously meant for a joke, his laugh was chorused by the seven.|4|17|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Hop-Frog also laughed although feebly and somewhat vacantly.|0|18|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""Come, come,"" said the king, impatiently, ""have you nothing to suggest""?"|0|19|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""I am endeavoring to think of something novel,"" replied the dwarf, abstractedly, for he was quite bewildered by the wine."|0|20|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""Endeavoring""!"|0|21|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"cried the tyrant, fiercely; ""what do you mean by that?"|1|21|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Ah, I perceive.|2|21|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
You are Sulky, and want more wine.|3|21|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"Here, drink this""!"|4|21|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
and he poured out another goblet full and offered it to the cripple, who merely gazed at it, gasping for breath.|5|21|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""Drink, I say""!"|0|22|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
The dwarf hesitated.|0|23|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
The king grew purple with rage.|1|23|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
The courtiers smirked.|2|23|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Trippetta, pale as a corpse, advanced to the monarch's seat, and, falling on her knees before him, implored him to spare her friend.|3|23|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
The tyrant regarded her, for some moments, in evident wonder at her audacity.|0|24|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
He seemed quite at a loss what to do or say–how most becomingly to express his indignation.|1|24|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
At last, without uttering a syllable, he pushed her violently from him, and threw the contents of the brimming goblet in her face.|2|24|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
The poor girl got up the best she could, and, not daring even to sigh, resumed her position at the foot of the table.|0|25|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
There was a dead silence for about half a minute, during which the falling of a leaf, or of a feather, might have been heard.|0|26|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
It was interrupted by a low, but harsh and protracted grating sound which seemed to come at once from every corner of the room.|1|26|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""What–what–what are you making that noise for""?"|0|27|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
demanded the king, turning furiously to the dwarf.|1|27|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""I–I?"|0|29|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"How could it have been me""?"|1|29|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""The sound appeared to come from without,"" observed one of the courtiers."|0|30|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""I fancy it was the parrot at the window, whetting his bill upon his cage-wires""."|1|30|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""True,"" replied the monarch, as if much relieved by the suggestion; ""but, on the honor of a knight, I could have sworn that it was the gritting of this vagabond's teeth""."|0|31|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Hereupon the dwarf laughed (the king was too confirmed a joker to object to any one's laughing), and displayed a set of large, powerful, and very repulsive teeth.|0|32|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Moreover, he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as much wine as desired.|1|32|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
The monarch was pacified; and having drained another bumper with no very perceptible ill effect, Hop-Frog entered at once, and with spirit, into the plans for the masquerade.|2|32|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""I cannot tell what was the association of idea,"" observed he, very tranquilly, and as if he had never tasted wine in his life, ""but just after your majesty, had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her face–just after your majesty had done this, and while the parrot was making that odd noise outside the window, there came into my mind a capital diversion–one of my own country frolics–often enacted among us, at our masquerades: but here it will be new altogether."|0|33|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""Here we are""!"|0|34|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"cried the king, laughing at his acute discovery of the coincidence; ""eight to a fraction–I and my seven ministers."|1|34|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Come!|2|34|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"what is the diversion""?"|3|34|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""We call it,"" replied the cripple, ""the Eight Chained Ourang-Outangs, and it really is excellent sport if well enacted""."|0|35|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""We will enact it,"" remarked the king, drawing himself up, and lowering his eyelids."|0|36|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""The beauty of the game,"" continued Hop-Frog, ""lies in the fright it occasions among the women""."|0|37|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""Capital""!"|0|38|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry.|1|38|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""I will equip you as ourang-outangs,"" proceeded the dwarf; ""leave all that to me."|0|39|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"The resemblance shall be so striking, that the company of masqueraders will take you for real beasts–and of course, they will be as much terrified as astonished""."|1|39|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""Oh, this is exquisite""!"|0|40|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
exclaimed the king.|1|40|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""Hop-Frog!"|2|40|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"I will make a man of you""."|3|40|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their jangling."|0|41|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
You are supposed to have escaped, en masse, from your keepers.|1|41|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Your majesty cannot conceive the effect produced, at a masquerade, by eight chained ourang-outangs, imagined to be real ones by most of the company; and rushing in with savage cries, among the crowd of delicately and gorgeously habited men and women.|2|41|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"The contrast is inimitable""!"|3|41|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""It must be,"" said the king: and the council arose hurriedly (as it was growing late), to put in execution the scheme of Hop-Frog."|0|42|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
His mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple, but effective enough for his purposes.|0|43|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
The animals in question had, at the epoch of my story, very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized world; and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently beast-like and more than sufficiently hideous, their truthfulness to nature was thus thought to be secured.|1|43|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
The king and his ministers were first encased in tight-fitting stockinet shirts and drawers.|0|44|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
They were then saturated with tar.|1|44|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
At this stage of the process, some one of the party suggested feathers; but the suggestion was at once overruled by the dwarf, who soon convinced the eight, by ocular demonstration, that the hair of such a brute as the ourang-outang was much more efficiently represented by flu.|2|44|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
A thick coating of the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar.|3|44|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
A long chain was now procured.|4|44|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
First, it was passed about the waist of the king, and tied, then about another of the party, and also tied; then about all successively, in the same manner.|5|44|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
When this chaining arrangement was complete, and the party stood as far apart from each other as possible, they formed a circle; and to make all things appear natural, Hop-Frog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters, at right angles, across the circle, after the fashion adopted, at the present day, by those who capture Chimpanzees, or other large apes, in Borneo.|6|44|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
The grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place, was a circular room, very lofty, and receiving the light of the sun only through a single window at top.|0|45|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
At night (the season for which the apartment was especially designed) it was illuminated principally by a large chandelier, depending by a chain from the centre of the sky-light, and lowered, or elevated, by means of a counter-balance as usual; but (in order not to look unsightly) this latter passed outside the cupola and over the roof.|1|45|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
The arrangements of the room had been left to Trippetta's superintendence; but, in some particulars, it seems, she had been guided by the calmer judgment of her friend the dwarf.|0|46|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
At his suggestion it was that, on this occasion, the chandelier was removed.|1|46|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Its waxen drippings (which, in weather so warm, it was quite impossible to prevent) would have been seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests, who, on account of the crowded state of the saloon, could not all be expected to keep from out its centre; that is to say, from under the chandelier.|2|46|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Additional sconces were set in various parts of the hall, out of the war, and a flambeau, emitting sweet odor, was placed in the right hand of each of the Caryatides that stood against the wall–some fifty or sixty altogether.|3|46|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
The eight ourang-outangs, taking Hop-Frog's advice, waited patiently until midnight (when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders) before making their appearance.|0|47|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
No sooner had the clock ceased striking, however, than they rushed, or rather rolled in, all together–for the impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall, and all to stumble as they entered.|1|47|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
The excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious, and filled the heart of the king with glee.|0|48|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
As had been anticipated, there were not a few of the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be beasts of some kind in reality, if not precisely ourang-outangs.|1|48|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Many of the women swooned with affright; and had not the king taken the precaution to exclude all weapons from the saloon, his party might soon have expiated their frolic in their blood.|2|48|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
As it was, a general rush was made for the doors; but the king had ordered them to be locked immediately upon his entrance; and, at the dwarf's suggestion, the keys had been deposited with him.|3|48|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
While the tumult was at its height, and each masquerader attentive only to his own safety (for, in fact, there was much real danger from the pressure of the excited crowd), the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung, and which had been drawn up on its removal, might have been seen very gradually to descend, until its hooked extremity came within three feet of the floor.|0|49|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Soon after this, the king and his seven friends having reeled about the hall in all directions, found themselves, at length, in its centre, and, of course, in immediate contact with the chain.|0|50|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
While they were thus situated, the dwarf, who had followed noiselessly at their heels, inciting them to keep up the commotion, took hold of their own chain at the intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle diametrically and at right angles.|1|50|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Here, with the rapidity of thought, he inserted the hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend; and, in an instant, by some unseen agency, the chandelier-chain was drawn so far upward as to take the hook out of reach, and, as an inevitable consequence, to drag the ourang-outangs together in close connection, and face to face.|2|50|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
The masqueraders, by this time, had recovered, in some measure, from their alarm; and, beginning to regard the whole matter as a well-contrived pleasantry, set up a loud shout of laughter at the predicament of the apes.|0|51|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""Leave them to me""!"|0|52|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
now screamed Hop-Frog, his shrill voice making itself easily heard through all the din.|1|52|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""Leave them to me."|2|52|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
I fancy I know them.|3|52|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"If I can only get a good look at them, I can soon tell who they are""."|4|52|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"Here, scrambling over the heads of the crowd, he managed to get to the wall; when, seizing a flambeau from one of the Caryatides, he returned, as he went, to the centre of the room-leaping, with the agility of a monkey, upon the kings head, and thence clambered a few feet up the chain; holding down the torch to examine the group of ourang-outangs, and still screaming: ""I shall soon find out who they are""!"|0|53|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
And now, while the whole assembly (the apes included) were convulsed with laughter, the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle; when the chain flew violently up for about thirty feet–dragging with it the dismayed and struggling ourang-outangs, and leaving them suspended in mid-air between the sky-light and the floor.|0|54|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Hop-Frog, clinging to the chain as it rose, still maintained his relative position in respect to the eight maskers, and still (as if nothing were the matter) continued to thrust his torch down toward them, as though endeavoring to discover who they were.|1|54|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
So thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent, that a dead silence, of about a minute's duration, ensued.|0|55|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
It was broken by just such a low, harsh, grating sound, as had before attracted the attention of the king and his councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of Trippetta.|1|55|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
But, on the present occasion, there could be no question as to whence the sound issued.|2|55|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
It came from the fang–like teeth of the dwarf, who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at the mouth, and glared, with an expression of maniacal rage, into the upturned countenances of the king and his seven companions.|3|55|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""Ah, ha""!"|0|56|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
said at length the infuriated jester.|1|56|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""Ah, ha!"|2|56|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"I begin to see who these people are now""!"|3|56|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Here, pretending to scrutinize the king more closely, he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him, and which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame.|4|56|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
In less than half a minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely, amid the shrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below, horror-stricken, and without the power to render them the slightest assistance.|5|56|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
At length the flames, suddenly increasing in virulence, forced the jester to climb higher up the chain, to be out of their reach; and, as he made this movement, the crowd again sank, for a brief instant, into silence.|0|57|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"""I now see distinctly""."|0|58|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"he said, ""what manner of people these maskers are."|1|58|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
They are a great king and his seven privy-councillors,–a king who does not scruple to strike a defenceless girl and his seven councillors who abet him in the outrage.|2|58|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
"As for myself, I am simply Hop-Frog, the jester–and this is my last jest""."|3|58|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
Owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it adhered, the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the work of vengeance was complete.|0|59|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
The eight corpses swung in their chains, a fetid, blackened, hideous, and indistinguishable mass.|1|59|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
The cripple hurled his torch at them, clambered leisurely to the ceiling, and disappeared through the sky-light.|2|59|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
It is supposed that Trippetta, stationed on the roof of the saloon, had been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge, and that, together, they effected their escape to their own country: for neither was seen again.|0|60|Hop-Frog|March 17, 1849|Horror
AFTER THE very minute and elaborate paper by Arago, to say nothing of the summary in 'Silliman's Journal,' with the detailed statement just published by Lieutenant Maury, it will not be supposed, of course, that in offering a few hurried remarks in reference to Von Kempelen's discovery, I have any design to look at the subject in a scientific point of view.|0|0|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
My object is simply, in the first place, to say a few words of Von Kempelen himself (with whom, some years ago, I had the honor of a slight personal acquaintance), since every thing which concerns him must necessarily, at this moment, be of interest; and, in the second place, to look in a general way, and speculatively, at the results of the discovery.|1|0|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
It may be as well, however, to premise the cursory observations which I have to offer, by denying, very decidedly, what seems to be a general impression (gleaned, as usual in a case of this kind, from the newspapers), viz.|0|1|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
: that this discovery, astounding as it unquestionably is, is unanticipated.|1|1|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
By reference to the 'Diary of Sir Humphrey Davy' (Cottle and Munroe, London, pp.|0|2|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
150), it will be seen at pp.|1|2|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
53 and 82, that this illustrious chemist had not only conceived the idea now in question, but had actually made no inconsiderable progress, experimentally, in the very identical analysis now so triumphantly brought to an issue by Von Kempelen, who although he makes not the slightest allusion to it, is, without doubt (I say it unhesitatingly, and can prove it, if required), indebted to the 'Diary' for at least the first hint of his own undertaking.|2|2|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
The paragraph from the 'Courier and Enquirer,' which is now going the rounds of the press, and which purports to claim the invention for a Mr. Kissam, of Brunswick, Maine, appears to me, I confess, a little apocryphal, for several reasons; although there is nothing either impossible or very improbable in the statement made.|0|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
I need not go into details.|1|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
My opinion of the paragraph is founded principally upon its manner.|2|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
It does not look true.|3|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
Persons who are narrating facts, are seldom so particular as Mr. Kissam seems to be, about day and date and precise location.|4|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
Besides, if Mr. Kissam actually did come upon the discovery he says he did, at the period designated- nearly eight years ago–how happens it that he took no steps, on the instant, to reap the immense benefits which the merest bumpkin must have known would have resulted to him individually, if not to the world at large, from the discovery?|5|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
It seems to me quite incredible that any man of common understanding could have discovered what Mr. Kissam says he did, and yet have subsequently acted so like a baby–so like an owl–as Mr. Kissam admits that he did.|6|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
By-the-way, who is Mr. Kissam?|7|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
and is not the whole paragraph in the 'Courier and Enquirer' a fabrication got up to 'make a talk'?|8|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
It must be confessed that it has an amazingly moon-hoaxy-air.|9|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
Very little dependence is to be placed upon it, in my humble opinion; and if I were not well aware, from experience, how very easily men of science are mystified, on points out of their usual range of inquiry, I should be profoundly astonished at finding so eminent a chemist as Professor Draper, discussing Mr. Kissam's (or is it Mr. Quizzem's?|10|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
) pretensions to the discovery, in so serious a tone.|11|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
But to return to the 'Diary' of Sir Humphrey Davy.|0|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
This pamphlet was not designed for the public eye, even upon the decease of the writer, as any person at all conversant with authorship may satisfy himself at once by the slightest inspection of the style.|1|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
At page 13, for example, near the middle, we read, in reference to his researches about the protoxide of azote: 'In less than half a minute the respiration being continued, diminished gradually and were succeeded by analogous to gentle pressure on all the muscles.|2|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
' That the respiration was not 'diminished,' is not only clear by the subsequent context, but by the use of the plural, 'were.|3|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
' The sentence, no doubt, was thus intended: 'In less than half a minute, the respiration [being continued, these feelings] diminished gradually, and were succeeded by [a sensation] analogous to gentle pressure on all the muscles.|4|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
' A hundred similar instances go to show that the MS.|5|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
so inconsiderately published, was merely a rough note-book, meant only for the writer's own eye, but an inspection of the pamphlet will convince almost any thinking person of the truth of my suggestion.|6|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
The fact is, Sir Humphrey Davy was about the last man in the world to commit himself on scientific topics.|7|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
Not only had he a more than ordinary dislike to quackery, but he was morbidly afraid of appearing empirical; so that, however fully he might have been convinced that he was on the right track in the matter now in question, he would never have spoken out, until he had every thing ready for the most practical demonstration.|8|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
I verily believe that his last moments would have been rendered wretched, could he have suspected that his wishes in regard to burning this 'Diary' (full of crude speculations) would have been unattended to; as, it seems, they were.|9|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
I say 'his wishes,' for that he meant to include this note-book among the miscellaneous papers directed 'to be burnt,' I think there can be no manner of doubt.|10|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
Whether it escaped the flames by good fortune or by bad, yet remains to be seen.|11|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
That the passages quoted above, with the other similar ones referred to, gave Von Kempelen the hint, I do not in the slightest degree question; but I repeat, it yet remains to be seen whether this momentous discovery itself (momentous under any circumstances) will be of service or disservice to mankind at large.|12|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
That Von Kempelen and his immediate friends will reap a rich harvest, it would be folly to doubt for a moment.|13|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
They will scarcely be so weak as not to 'realize,' in time, by large purchases of houses and land, with other property of intrinsic value.|14|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
In the brief account of Von Kempelen which appeared in the 'Home Journal,' and has since been extensively copied, several misapprehensions of the German original seem to have been made by the translator, who professes to have taken the passage from a late number of the Presburg 'Schnellpost.|0|5|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
' 'Viele' has evidently been misconceived (as it often is), and what the translator renders by 'sorrows,' is probably 'lieden,' which, in its true version, 'sufferings,' would give a totally different complexion to the whole account; but, of course, much of this is merely guess, on my part.|1|5|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
Von Kempelen, however, is by no means 'a misanthrope,' in appearance, at least, whatever he may be in fact.|0|6|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
My acquaintance with him was casual altogether; and I am scarcely warranted in saying that I know him at all; but to have seen and conversed with a man of so prodigious a notoriety as he has attained, or will attain in a few days, is not a small matter, as times go.|1|6|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
'The Literary World' speaks of him, confidently, as a native of Presburg (misled, perhaps, by the account in 'The Home Journal') but I am pleased in being able to state positively, since I have it from his own lips, that he was born in Utica, in the State of New York, although both his parents, I believe, are of Presburg descent.|0|7|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
The family is connected, in some way, with Maelzel, of Automaton-chess-player memory.|1|7|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
In person, he is short and stout, with large, fat, blue eyes, sandy hair and whiskers, a wide but pleasing mouth, fine teeth, and I think a Roman nose.|2|7|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
There is some defect in one of his feet.|3|7|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
His address is frank, and his whole manner noticeable for bonhomie.|4|7|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
Altogether, he looks, speaks, and acts as little like 'a misanthrope' as any man I ever saw.|5|7|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
We were fellow-sojouners for a week about six years ago, at Earl's Hotel, in Providence, Rhode Island; and I presume that I conversed with him, at various times, for some three or four hours altogether.|6|7|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
His principal topics were those of the day, and nothing that fell from him led me to suspect his scientific attainments.|7|7|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
He left the hotel before me, intending to go to New York, and thence to Bremen; it was in the latter city that his great discovery was first made public; or, rather, it was there that he was first suspected of having made it.|8|7|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
This is about all that I personally know of the now immortal Von Kempelen; but I have thought that even these few details would have interest for the public.|9|7|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
There can be little question that most of the marvellous rumors afloat about this affair are pure inventions, entitled to about as much credit as the story of Aladdin's lamp; and yet, in a case of this kind, as in the case of the discoveries in California, it is clear that the truth may be stranger than fiction.|0|8|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
The following anecdote, at least, is so well authenticated, that we may receive it implicitly.|1|8|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
Von Kempelen had never been even tolerably well off during his residence at Bremen; and often, it was well known, he had been put to extreme shifts in order to raise trifling sums.|0|9|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
When the great excitement occurred about the forgery on the house of Gutsmuth &amp; Co., suspicion was directed toward Von Kempelen, on account of his having purchased a considerable property in Gasperitch Lane, and his refusing, when questioned, to explain how he became possessed of the purchase money.|1|9|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
He was at length arrested, but nothing decisive appearing against him, was in the end set at liberty.|2|9|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
The police, however, kept a strict watch upon his movements, and thus discovered that he left home frequently, taking always the same road, and invariably giving his watchers the slip in the neighborhood of that labyrinth of narrow and crooked passages known by the flash name of the 'Dondergat.|3|9|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
' Finally, by dint of great perseverance, they traced him to a garret in an old house of seven stories, in an alley called Flatzplatz,–and, coming upon him suddenly, found him, as they imagined, in the midst of his counterfeiting operations.|4|9|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
His agitation is represented as so excessive that the officers had not the slightest doubt of his guilt.|5|9|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
After hand-cuffing him, they searched his room, or rather rooms, for it appears he occupied all the mansarde.|6|9|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
Opening into the garret where they caught him, was a closet, ten feet by eight, fitted up with some chemical apparatus, of which the object has not yet been ascertained.|0|10|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
In one corner of the closet was a very small furnace, with a glowing fire in it, and on the fire a kind of duplicate crucible–two crucibles connected by a tube.|1|10|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
One of these crucibles was nearly full of lead in a state of fusion, but not reaching up to the aperture of the tube, which was close to the brim.|2|10|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
The other crucible had some liquid in it, which, as the officers entered, seemed to be furiously dissipating in vapor.|3|10|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
They relate that, on finding himself taken, Kempelen seized the crucibles with both hands (which were encased in gloves that afterwards turned out to be asbestic), and threw the contents on the tiled floor.|4|10|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
It was now that they hand-cuffed him; and before proceeding to ransack the premises they searched his person, but nothing unusual was found about him, excepting a paper parcel, in his coat-pocket, containing what was afterward ascertained to be a mixture of antimony and some unknown substance, in nearly, but not quite, equal proportions.|5|10|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
All attempts at analyzing the unknown substance have, so far, failed, but that it will ultimately be analyzed, is not to be doubted.|6|10|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
Passing out of the closet with their prisoner, the officers went through a sort of ante-chamber, in which nothing material was found, to the chemist's sleeping-room.|0|11|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
They here rummaged some drawers and boxes, but discovered only a few papers, of no importance, and some good coin, silver and gold.|1|11|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
At length, looking under the bed, they saw a large, common hair trunk, without hinges, hasp, or lock, and with the top lying carelessly across the bottom portion.|2|11|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
Upon attempting to draw this trunk out from under the bed, they found that, with their united strength (there were three of them, all powerful men), they 'could not stir it one inch.|3|11|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
'No wonder we couldn't move it–why it's full to the brim of old bits of brass!|0|12|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
Putting his feet, now, against the wall so as to get a good purchase, and pushing with all his force, while his companions pulled with an theirs, the trunk, with much difficulty, was slid out from under the bed, and its contents examined.|0|13|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
The supposed brass with which it was filled was all in small, smooth pieces, varying from the size of a pea to that of a dollar; but the pieces were irregular in shape, although more or less flat-looking, upon the whole, 'very much as lead looks when thrown upon the ground in a molten state, and there suffered to grow cool.|1|13|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
' Now, not one of these officers for a moment suspected this metal to be any thing but brass.|2|13|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
The idea of its being gold never entered their brains, of course; how could such a wild fancy have entered it?|3|13|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
And their astonishment may be well conceived, when the next day it became known, all over Bremen, that the 'lot of brass' which they had carted so contemptuously to the police office, without putting themselves to the trouble of pocketing the smallest scrap, was not only gold–real gold–but gold far finer than any employed in coinage-gold, in fact, absolutely pure, virgin, without the slightest appreciable alloy.|4|13|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
I need not go over the details of Von Kempelen's confession (as far as it went) and release, for these are familiar to the public.|0|14|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
That he has actually realized, in spirit and in effect, if not to the letter, the old chimaera of the philosopher's stone, no sane person is at liberty to doubt.|1|14|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
The opinions of Arago are, of course, entitled to the greatest consideration; but he is by no means infallible; and what he says of bismuth, in his report to the Academy, must be taken cum grano salis.|2|14|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
The simple truth is, that up to this period all analysis has failed; and until Von Kempelen chooses to let us have the key to his own published enigma, it is more than probable that the matter will remain, for years, in statu quo.|3|14|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
All that as yet can fairly be said to be known is, that 'Pure gold can be made at will, and very readily from lead in connection with certain other substances, in kind and in proportions, unknown.|4|14|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
Speculation, of course, is busy as to the immediate and ultimate results of this discovery–a discovery which few thinking persons will hesitate in referring to an increased interest in the matter of gold generally, by the late developments in California; and this reflection brings us inevitably to another–the exceeding inopportuneness of Von Kempelen's analysis.|0|15|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
If many were prevented from adventuring to California, by the mere apprehension that gold would so materially diminish in value, on account of its plentifulness in the mines there, as to render the speculation of going so far in search of it a doubtful one–what impression will be wrought now, upon the minds of those about to emigrate, and especially upon the minds of those actually in the mineral region, by the announcement of this astounding discovery of Von Kempelen?|1|15|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
a discovery which declares, in so many words, that beyond its intrinsic worth for manufacturing purposes (whatever that worth may be), gold now is, or at least soon will be (for it cannot be supposed that Von Kempelen can long retain his secret), of no greater value than lead, and of far inferior value to silver.|2|15|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
It is, indeed, exceedingly difficult to speculate prospectively upon the consequences of the discovery, but one thing may be positively maintained–that the announcement of the discovery six months ago would have had material influence in regard to the settlement of California.|3|15|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax
In Europe, as yet, the most noticeable results have been a rise of two hundred per cent.|0|16|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|April 14, 1849|Hoax

AS it is well known that the 'wise men' came 'from the East,' and as Mr. Touch-and-go Bullet-head came from the East, it follows that Mr. Bullet-head was a wise man; and if collateral proof of the matter be needed, here we have it–Mr. B. was an editor.|0|0|X-Ing A Paragrab|May 12, 1849|Humor

' I have shown that Touch-and-go Bullet-head was a wise man; and the only occasion on which he did not prove infallible, was when, abandoning that legitimate home for all wise men, the East, he migrated to the city of Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis, or some place of a similar title, out West.|3|0|X-Ing A Paragrab|May 12, 1849|Humor
I must do him the justice to say, however, that when he made up his mind finally to settle in that town, it was under the impression that no newspaper, and consequently no editor, existed in that particular section of the country.|0|1|X-Ing A Paragrab|May 12, 1849|Humor
In establishing 'The Tea-Pot' he expected to have the field all to himself.|1|1|X-Ing A Paragrab|May 12, 1849|Humor
I feel confident he never would have dreamed of taking up his residence in Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis had he been aware that, in Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis, there lived a gentleman named John Smith (if I rightly remember), who for many years had there quietly grown fat in editing and publishing the 'Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis Gazette.|2|1|X-Ing A Paragrab|May 12, 1849|Humor

In the first place, of course,–as the opening word was 'So,'–he made a plunge into the capital S hole and came out in triumph with a capital S. Elated by this success, he immediately threw himself upon the little-o box with a blindfold impetuosity–but who shall describe his horror when his fingers came up without the anticipated letter in their clutch?|0|11|X-Ing A Paragrab|May 12, 1849|Humor

The exigency here described is by no means of rare occurrence in printing-offices; and I cannot tell how to account for it, but the fact is indisputable, that when the exigency does occur, it almost always happens that x is adopted as a substitute for the letter deficient.|0|21|X-Ing A Paragrab|May 12, 1849|Humor
The true reason, perhaps, is that x is rather the most superabundant letter in the cases, or at least was so in the old times–long enough to render the substitution in question an habitual thing with printers.|1|21|X-Ing A Paragrab|May 12, 1849|Humor
As for Bob, he would have considered it heretical to employ any other character, in a case of this kind, than the x to which he had been accustomed.|2|21|X-Ing A Paragrab|May 12, 1849|Humor

The first definite idea entertained by the populace was, that some diabolical treason lay concealed in the hieroglyphics; and there was a general rush to Bullet-head's residence, for the purpose of riding him on a rail; but that gentleman was nowhere to be found.|1|24|X-Ing A Paragrab|May 12, 1849|Humor

DURING A pedestrian trip last summer, through one or two of the river counties of New York, I found myself, as the day declined, somewhat embarrassed about the road I was pursuing.|0|0|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The land undulated very remarkably; and my path, for the last hour, had wound about and about so confusedly, in its effort to keep in the valleys, that I no longer knew in what direction lay the sweet village of B-, where I had determined to stop for the night.|1|0|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The sun had scarcely shone–strictly speaking–during the day, which nevertheless, had been unpleasantly warm.|2|0|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
A smoky mist, resembling that of the Indian summer, enveloped all things, and of course, added to my uncertainty.|3|0|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Not that I cared much about the matter.|4|0|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
If I did not hit upon the village before sunset, or even before dark, it was more than possible that a little Dutch farmhouse, or something of that kind, would soon make its appearance–although, in fact, the neighborhood (perhaps on account of being more picturesque than fertile) was very sparsely inhabited.|5|0|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
At all events, with my knapsack for a pillow, and my hound as a sentry, a bivouac in the open air was just the thing which would have amused me.|6|0|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
I sauntered on, therefore, quite at ease–Ponto taking charge of my gun–until at length, just as I had begun to consider whether the numerous little glades that led hither and thither, were intended to be paths at all, I was conducted by one of them into an unquestionable carriage track.|7|0|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
There could be no mistaking it.|8|0|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The traces of light wheels were evident; and although the tall shrubberies and overgrown undergrowth met overhead, there was no obstruction whatever below, even to the passage of a Virginian mountain wagon–the most aspiring vehicle, I take it, of its kind.|9|0|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The road, however, except in being open through the wood–if wood be not too weighty a name for such an assemblage of light trees–and except in the particulars of evident wheel-tracks–bore no resemblance to any road I had before seen.|10|0|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The tracks of which I speak were but faintly perceptible–having been impressed upon the firm, yet pleasantly moist surface of–what looked more like green Genoese velvet than any thing else.|11|0|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
It was grass, clearly–but grass such as we seldom see out of England–so short, so thick, so even, and so vivid in color.|12|0|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Not a single impediment lay in the wheel-route–not even a chip or dead twig.|13|0|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The stones that once obstructed the way had been carefully placed–not thrown-along the sides of the lane, so as to define its boundaries at bottom with a kind of half-precise, half-negligent, and wholly picturesque definition.|14|0|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Clumps of wild flowers grew everywhere, luxuriantly, in the interspaces.|15|0|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
What to make of all this, of course I knew not.|0|1|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
"Here was art undoubtedly–that did not surprise me–all roads, in the ordinary sense, are works of art; nor can I say that there was much to wonder at in the mere excess of art manifested; all that seemed to have been done, might have been done here–with such natural ""capabilities"" (as they have it in the books on Landscape Gardening)–with very little labor and expense."|1|1|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
No; it was not the amount but the character of the art which caused me to take a seat on one of the blossomy stones and gaze up and down this fairy–like avenue for half an hour or more in bewildered admiration.|2|1|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
One thing became more and more evident the longer I gazed: an artist, and one with a most scrupulous eye for form, had superintended all these arrangements.|3|1|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The greatest care had been taken to preserve a due medium between the neat and graceful on the one hand, and the pittoresque, in the true sense of the Italian term, on the other.|4|1|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
There were few straight, and no long uninterrupted lines.|5|1|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The same effect of curvature or of color appeared twice, usually, but not oftener, at any one point of view.|6|1|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Everywhere was variety in uniformity.|7|1|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
"It was a piece of ""composition,"" in which the most fastidiously critical taste could scarcely have suggested an emendation."|8|1|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
I had turned to the right as I entered this road, and now, arising, I continued in the same direction.|0|2|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The path was so serpentine, that at no moment could I trace its course for more than two or three paces in advance.|1|2|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Its character did not undergo any material change.|2|2|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Presently the murmur of water fell gently upon my ear–and in a few moments afterward, as I turned with the road somewhat more abruptly than hitherto, I became aware that a building of some kind lay at the foot of a gentle declivity just before me.|0|3|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
I could see nothing distinctly on account of the mist which occupied all the little valley below.|1|3|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
A gentle breeze, however, now arose, as the sun was about descending; and while I remained standing on the brow of the slope, the fog gradually became dissipated into wreaths, and so floated over the scene.|2|3|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
"As it came fully into view–thus gradually as I describe it–piece by piece, here a tree, there a glimpse of water, and here again the summit of a chimney, I could scarcely help fancying that the whole was one of the ingenious illusions sometimes exhibited under the name of ""vanishing pictures""."|0|4|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
By the time, however, that the fog had thoroughly disappeared, the sun had made its way down behind the gentle hills, and thence, as it with a slight chassez to the south, had come again fully into sight, glaring with a purplish lustre through a chasm that entered the valley from the west.|0|5|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Suddenly, therefore–and as if by the hand of magic- this whole valley and every thing in it became brilliantly visible.|1|5|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The first coup d'oeil, as the sun slid into the position described, impressed me very much as I have been impressed, when a boy, by the concluding scene of some well-arranged theatrical spectacle or melodrama.|0|6|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Not even the monstrosity of color was wanting; for the sunlight came out through the chasm, tinted all orange and purple; while the vivid green of the grass in the valley was reflected more or less upon all objects from the curtain of vapor that still hung overhead, as if loth to take its total departure from a scene so enchantingly beautiful.|1|6|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The little vale into which I thus peered down from under the fog canopy could not have been more than four hundred yards long; while in breadth it varied from fifty to one hundred and fifty or perhaps two hundred.|0|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
It was most narrow at its northern extremity, opening out as it tended southwardly, but with no very precise regularity.|1|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The widest portion was within eighty yards of the southern extreme.|2|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The slopes which encompassed the vale could not fairly be called hills, unless at their northern face.|3|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Here a precipitous ledge of granite arose to a height of some ninety feet; and, as I have mentioned, the valley at this point was not more than fifty feet wide; but as the visiter proceeded southwardly from the cliff, he found on his right hand and on his left, declivities at once less high, less precipitous, and less rocky.|4|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
All, in a word, sloped and softened to the south; and yet the whole vale was engirdled by eminences, more or less high, except at two points.|5|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
One of these I have already spoken of.|6|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
It lay considerably to the north of west, and was where the setting sun made its way, as I have before described, into the amphitheatre, through a cleanly cut natural cleft in the granite embankment; this fissure might have been ten yards wide at its widest point, so far as the eye could trace it.|7|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
It seemed to lead up, up like a natural causeway, into the recesses of unexplored mountains and forests.|8|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The other opening was directly at the southern end of the vale.|9|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Here, generally, the slopes were nothing more than gentle inclinations, extending from east to west about one hundred and fifty yards.|10|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
In the middle of this extent was a depression, level with the ordinary floor of the valley.|11|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
As regards vegetation, as well as in respect to every thing else, the scene softened and sloped to the south.|12|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
To the north–on the craggy precipice–a few paces from the verge–up sprang the magnificent trunks of numerous hickories, black walnuts, and chestnuts, interspersed with occasional oak, and the strong lateral branches thrown out by the walnuts especially, spread far over the edge of the cliff.|13|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Proceeding southwardly, the explorer saw, at first, the same class of trees, but less and less lofty and Salvatorish in character; then he saw the gentler elm, succeeded by the sassafras and locust–these again by the softer linden, red-bud, catalpa, and maple–these yet again by still more graceful and more modest varieties.|14|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The whole face of the southern declivity was covered with wild shrubbery alone–an occasional silver willow or white poplar excepted.|15|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
In the bottom of the valley itself–(for it must be borne in mind that the vegetation hitherto mentioned grew only on the cliffs or hillsides)–were to be seen three insulated trees.|16|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
One was an elm of fine size and exquisite form: it stood guard over the southern gate of the vale.|17|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Another was a hickory, much larger than the elm, and altogether a much finer tree, although both were exceedingly beautiful: it seemed to have taken charge of the northwestern entrance, springing from a group of rocks in the very jaws of the ravine, and throwing its graceful body, at an angle of nearly forty-five degrees, far out into the sunshine of the amphitheatre.|18|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
About thirty yards east of this tree stood, however, the pride of the valley, and beyond all question the most magnificent tree I have ever seen, unless, perhaps, among the cypresses of the Itchiatuckanee.|19|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
It was a triple–stemmed tulip-tree–the Liriodendron Tulipiferum–one of the natural order of magnolias.|20|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Its three trunks separated from the parent at about three feet from the soil, and diverging very slightly and gradually, were not more than four feet apart at the point where the largest stem shot out into foliage: this was at an elevation of about eighty feet.|21|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The whole height of the principal division was one hundred and twenty feet.|22|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Nothing can surpass in beauty the form, or the glossy, vivid green of the leaves of the tulip-tree.|23|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
In the present instance they were fully eight inches wide; but their glory was altogether eclipsed by the gorgeous splendor of the profuse blossoms.|24|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Conceive, closely congregated, a million of the largest and most resplendent tulips!|25|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Only thus can the reader get any idea of the picture I would convey.|26|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
And then the stately grace of the clean, delicately–granulated columnar stems, the largest four feet in diameter, at twenty from the ground.|27|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The innumerable blossoms, mingling with those of other trees scarcely less beautiful, although infinitely less majestic, filled the valley with more than Arabian perfumes.|28|7|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The general floor of the amphitheatre was grass of the same character as that I had found in the road; if anything, more deliciously soft, thick, velvety, and miraculously green.|0|8|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
It was hard to conceive how all this beauty had been attained.|1|8|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
I have spoken of two openings into the vale.|0|9|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
From the one to the northwest issued a rivulet, which came, gently murmuring and slightly foaming, down the ravine, until it dashed against the group of rocks out of which sprang the insulated hickory.|1|9|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Here, after encircling the tree, it passed on a little to the north of east, leaving the tulip tree some twenty feet to the south, and making no decided alteration in its course until it came near the midway between the eastern and western boundaries of the valley.|2|9|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
At this point, after a series of sweeps, it turned off at right angles and pursued a generally southern direction meandering as it went–until it became lost in a small lake of irregular figure (although roughly oval), that lay gleaming near the lower extremity of the vale.|3|9|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
This lakelet was, perhaps, a hundred yards in diameter at its widest part.|4|9|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
No crystal could be clearer than its waters.|5|9|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Its bottom, which could be distinctly seen, consisted altogether, of pebbles brilliantly white.|6|9|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Its banks, of the emerald grass already described, rounded, rather than sloped, off into the clear heaven below; and so clear was this heaven, so perfectly, at times, did it reflect all objects above it, that where the true bank ended and where the mimic one commenced, it was a point of no little difficulty to determine.|7|9|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The trout, and some other varieties of fish, with which this pond seemed to be almost inconveniently crowded, had all the appearance of veritable flying-fish.|8|9|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
It was almost impossible to believe that they were not absolutely suspended in the air.|9|9|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
A light birch canoe that lay placidly on the water, was reflected in its minutest fibres with a fidelity unsurpassed by the most exquisitely polished mirror.|10|9|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
A small island, fairly laughing with flowers in full bloom, and affording little more space than just enough for a picturesque little building, seemingly a fowl-house–arose from the lake not far from its northern shore–to which it was connected by means of an inconceivably light–looking and yet very primitive bridge.|11|9|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
It was formed of a single, broad and thick plank of the tulip wood.|12|9|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
This was forty feet long, and spanned the interval between shore and shore with a slight but very perceptible arch, preventing all oscillation.|13|9|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
"From the southern extreme of the lake issued a continuation of the rivulet, which, after meandering for, perhaps, thirty yards, finally passed through the ""depression"" (already described) in the middle of the southern declivity, and tumbling down a sheer precipice of a hundred feet, made its devious and unnoticed way to the Hudson."|14|9|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The lake was deep–at some points thirty feet–but the rivulet seldom exceeded three, while its greatest width was about eight.|0|10|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Its bottom and banks were as those of the pond–if a defect could have been attributed, in point of picturesqueness, it was that of excessive neatness.|1|10|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The expanse of the green turf was relieved, here and there, by an occasional showy shrub, such as the hydrangea, or the common snowball, or the aromatic seringa; or, more frequently, by a clump of geraniums blossoming gorgeously in great varieties.|0|11|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
These latter grew in pots which were carefully buried in the soil, so as to give the plants the appearance of being indigenous.|1|11|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Besides all this, the lawn's velvet was exquisitely spotted with sheep–a considerable flock of which roamed about the vale, in company with three tamed deer, and a vast number of brilliantly–plumed ducks.|2|11|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
A very large mastiff seemed to be in vigilant attendance upon these animals, each and all.|3|11|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Along the eastern and western cliffs–where, toward the upper portion of the amphitheatre, the boundaries were more or less precipitous–grew ivy in great profusion–so that only here and there could even a glimpse of the naked rock be obtained.|0|12|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The northern precipice, in like manner, was almost entirely clothed by grape-vines of rare luxuriance; some springing from the soil at the base of the cliff, and others from ledges on its face.|1|12|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The slight elevation which formed the lower boundary of this little domain, was crowned by a neat stone wall, of sufficient height to prevent the escape of the deer.|0|13|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Nothing of the fence kind was observable elsewhere; for nowhere else was an artificial enclosure needed:–any stray sheep, for example, which should attempt to make its way out of the vale by means of the ravine, would find its progress arrested, after a few yards' advance, by the precipitous ledge of rock over which tumbled the cascade that had arrested my attention as I first drew near the domain.|1|13|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
In short, the only ingress or egress was through a gate occupying a rocky pass in the road, a few paces below the point at which I stopped to reconnoitre the scene.|2|13|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
I have described the brook as meandering very irregularly through the whole of its course.|0|14|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Its two general directions, as I have said, were first from west to east, and then from north to south.|1|14|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
At the turn, the stream, sweeping backward, made an almost circular loop, so as to form a peninsula which was very nearly an island, and which included about the sixteenth of an acre.|2|14|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
"On this peninsula stood a dwelling-house–and when I say that this house, like the infernal terrace seen by Vathek, ""etait d'une architecture inconnue dans les annales de la terre,"" I mean, merely, that its tout ensemble struck me with the keenest sense of combined novelty and propriety–in a word, of poetry–(for, than in the words just employed, I could scarcely give, of poetry in the abstract, a more rigorous definition)–and I do not mean that merely outre was perceptible in any respect."|3|14|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
In fact nothing could well be more simple–more utterly unpretending than this cottage.|0|15|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Its marvellous effect lay altogether in its artistic arrangement as a picture.|1|15|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
I could have fancied, while I looked at it, that some eminent landscape-painter had built it with his brush.|2|15|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The point of view from which I first saw the valley, was not altogether, although it was nearly, the best point from which to survey the house.|0|16|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
I will therefore describe it as I afterwards saw it- from a position on the stone wall at the southern extreme of the amphitheatre.|1|16|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The main building was about twenty-four feet long and sixteen broad- certainly not more.|0|17|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Its total height, from the ground to the apex of the roof, could not have exceeded eighteen feet.|1|17|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
To the west end of this structure was attached one about a third smaller in all its proportions:–the line of its front standing back about two yards from that of the larger house, and the line of its roof, of course, being considerably depressed below that of the roof adjoining.|2|17|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
At right angles to these buildings, and from the rear of the main one–not exactly in the middle–extended a third compartment, very small- being, in general, one-third less than the western wing.|3|17|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The roofs of the two larger were very steep–sweeping down from the ridge-beam with a long concave curve, and extending at least four feet beyond the walls in front, so as to form the roofs of two piazzas.|4|17|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
These latter roofs, of course, needed no support; but as they had the air of needing it, slight and perfectly plain pillars were inserted at the corners alone.|5|17|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The roof of the northern wing was merely an extension of a portion of the main roof.|6|17|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Between the chief building and western wing arose a very tall and rather slender square chimney of hard Dutch bricks, alternately black and red:–a slight cornice of projecting bricks at the top.|7|17|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Over the gables the roofs also projected very much:–in the main building about four feet to the east and two to the west.|8|17|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The principal door was not exactly in the main division, being a little to the east–while the two windows were to the west.|9|17|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
These latter did not extend to the floor, but were much longer and narrower than usual–they had single shutters like doors- the panes were of lozenge form, but quite large.|10|17|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The door itself had its upper half of glass, also in lozenge panes–a movable shutter secured it at night.|11|17|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The door to the west wing was in its gable, and quite simple–a single window looked out to the south.|12|17|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
There was no external door to the north wing, and it also had only one window to the east.|13|17|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The blank wall of the eastern gable was relieved by stairs (with a balustrade) running diagonally across it–the ascent being from the south.|0|18|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Under cover of the widely projecting eave these steps gave access to a door leading to the garret, or rather loft–for it was lighted only by a single window to the north, and seemed to have been intended as a store-room.|1|18|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The piazzas of the main building and western wing had no floors, as is usual; but at the doors and at each window, large, flat irregular slabs of granite lay imbedded in the delicious turf, affording comfortable footing in all weather.|0|19|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Excellent paths of the same material–not nicely adapted, but with the velvety sod filling frequent intervals between the stones, led hither and thither from the house, to a crystal spring about five paces off, to the road, or to one or two out–houses that lay to the north, beyond the brook, and were thoroughly concealed by a few locusts and catalpas.|1|19|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Not more than six steps from the main door of the cottage stood the dead trunk of a fantastic pear-tree, so clothed from head to foot in the gorgeous bignonia blossoms that one required no little scrutiny to determine what manner of sweet thing it could be.|0|20|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
From various arms of this tree hung cages of different kinds.|1|20|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
In one, a large wicker cylinder with a ring at top, revelled a mocking bird; in another an oriole; in a third the impudent bobolink–while three or four more delicate prisons were loudly vocal with canaries.|2|20|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The pillars of the piazza were enwreathed in jasmine and sweet honeysuckle; while from the angle formed by the main structure and its west wing, in front, sprang a grape-vine of unexampled luxuriance.|0|21|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Scorning all restraint, it had clambered first to the lower roof–then to the higher; and along the ridge of this latter it continued to writhe on, throwing out tendrils to the right and left, until at length it fairly attained the east gable, and fell trailing over the stairs.|1|21|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The whole house, with its wings, was constructed of the old-fashioned Dutch shingles–broad, and with unrounded corners.|0|22|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
It is a peculiarity of this material to give houses built of it the appearance of being wider at bottom than at top–after the manner of Egyptian architecture; and in the present instance, this exceedingly picturesque effect was aided by numerous pots of gorgeous flowers that almost encompassed the base of the buildings.|1|22|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The shingles were painted a dull gray; and the happiness with which this neutral tint melted into the vivid green of the tulip tree leaves that partially overshadowed the cottage, can readily be conceived by an artist.|0|23|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
From the position near the stone wall, as described, the buildings were seen at great advantage–for the southeastern angle was thrown forward–so that the eye took in at once the whole of the two fronts, with the picturesque eastern gable, and at the same time obtained just a sufficient glimpse of the northern wing, with parts of a pretty roof to the spring-house, and nearly half of a light bridge that spanned the brook in the near vicinity of the main buildings.|0|24|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
I did not remain very long on the brow of the hill, although long enough to make a thorough survey of the scene at my feet.|0|25|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
It was clear that I had wandered from the road to the village, and I had thus good traveller's excuse to open the gate before me, and inquire my way, at all events; so, without more ado, I proceeded.|1|25|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The road, after passing the gate, seemed to lie upon a natural ledge, sloping gradually down along the face of the north-eastern cliffs.|0|26|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
It led me on to the foot of the northern precipice, and thence over the bridge, round by the eastern gable to the front door.|1|26|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
In this progress, I took notice that no sight of the out-houses could be obtained.|2|26|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
As I turned the corner of the gable, the mastiff bounded towards me in stern silence, but with the eye and the whole air of a tiger.|0|27|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
I held him out my hand, however, in token of amity–and I never yet knew the dog who was proof against such an appeal to his courtesy.|1|27|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
He not only shut his mouth and wagged his tail, but absolutely offered me his paw-afterward extending his civilities to Ponto.|2|27|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
As no bell was discernible, I rapped with my stick against the door, which stood half open.|0|28|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Instantly a figure advanced to the threshold- that of a young woman about twenty-eight years of age–slender, or rather slight, and somewhat above the medium height.|1|28|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
As she approached, with a certain modest decision of step altogether indescribable.|2|28|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
"I said to myself, ""Surely here I have found the perfection of natural, in contradistinction from artificial grace""."|3|28|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The second impression which she made on me, but by far the more vivid of the two, was that of enthusiasm.|4|28|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
So intense an expression of romance, perhaps I should call it, or of unworldliness, as that which gleamed from her deep-set eyes, had never so sunk into my heart of hearts before.|5|28|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
I know not how it is, but this peculiar expression of the eye, wreathing itself occasionally into the lips, is the most powerful, if not absolutely the sole spell, which rivets my interest in woman.|6|28|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
"""Romance, provided my readers fully comprehended what I would here imply by the word–""romance"" and ""womanliness"" seem to me convertible terms: and, after all, what man truly loves in woman, is simply her womanhood."|7|28|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
"The eyes of Annie (I heard some one from the interior call her ""Annie, darling""!"|8|28|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
") were ""spiritual grey;"" her hair, a light chestnut: this is all I had time to observe of her."|9|28|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
At her most courteous of invitations, I entered–passing first into a tolerably wide vestibule.|0|29|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Having come mainly to observe, I took notice that to my right as I stepped in, was a window, such as those in front of the house; to the left, a door leading into the principal room; while, opposite me, an open door enabled me to see a small apartment, just the size of the vestibule, arranged as a study, and having a large bow window looking out to the north.|1|29|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Passing into the parlor, I found myself with Mr. Landor–for this, I afterwards found, was his name.|0|30|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
He was civil, even cordial in his manner, but just then, I was more intent on observing the arrangements of the dwelling which had so much interested me, than the personal appearance of the tenant.|1|30|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The north wing, I now saw, was a bed-chamber, its door opened into the parlor.|0|31|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
West of this door was a single window, looking toward the brook.|1|31|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
At the west end of the parlor, were a fireplace, and a door leading into the west wing–probably a kitchen.|2|31|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Nothing could be more rigorously simple than the furniture of the parlor.|0|32|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
On the floor was an ingrain carpet, of excellent texture–a white ground, spotted with small circular green figures.|1|32|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
At the windows were curtains of snowy white jaconet muslin: they were tolerably full, and hung decisively, perhaps rather formally in sharp, parallel plaits to the floor–just to the floor.|2|32|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The walls were prepared with a French paper of great delicacy, a silver ground, with a faint green cord running zig-zag throughout.|3|32|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Its expanse was relieved merely by three of Julien's exquisite lithographs a trois crayons, fastened to the wall without frames.|4|32|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
"One of these drawings was a scene of Oriental luxury, or rather voluptuousness; another was a ""carnival piece,"" spirited beyond compare; the third was a Greek female head–a face so divinely beautiful, and yet of an expression so provokingly indeterminate, never before arrested my attention."|5|32|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
"The more substantial furniture consisted of a round table, a few chairs (including a large rocking-chair), and a sofa, or rather ""settee;"" its material was plain maple painted a creamy white, slightly interstriped with green; the seat of cane."|0|33|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
"The chairs and table were ""to match,"" but the forms of all had evidently been designed by the same brain which planned ""the grounds;"" it is impossible to conceive anything more graceful."|1|33|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
On the table were a few books, a large, square, crystal bottle of some novel perfume, a plain ground–glass astral (not solar) lamp with an Italian shade, and a large vase of resplendently-blooming flowers.|0|34|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
Flowers, indeed, of gorgeous colours and delicate odour formed the sole mere decoration of the apartment.|1|34|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
The fire-place was nearly filled with a vase of brilliant geranium.|2|34|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
On a triangular shelf in each angle of the room stood also a similar vase, varied only as to its lovely contents.|3|34|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
One or two smaller bouquets adorned the mantel, and late violets clustered about the open windows.|4|34|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
It is not the purpose of this work to do more than give in detail, a picture of Mr. Landor's residence–as I found it.|0|35|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
How he made it what it was–and why–with some particulars of Mr. Landor himself- may, possibly form the subject of another article.|1|35|Landor'S Cottage|June 9, 1849|Sketch
UPON my return to the United States a few months ago, after the extraordinary series of adventure in the South Seas and elsewhere, of which an account is given in the following pages, accident threw me into the society of several gentlemen in Richmond, Va.|0|0|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
, who felt deep interest in all matters relating to the regions I had visited, and who were constantly urging it upon me, as a duty, to give my narrative to the public.|1|0|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I had several reasons, however, for declining to do so, some of which were of a nature altogether private, and concern no person but myself, others not so much so.|2|0|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
One consideration which deterred me was, that, having kept no journal during a greater portion of the time in which I was absent, I feared I should not be able to write, from mere memory, a statement so minute and connected as to have the appearance of that truth it would really possess, barring only the natural and unavoidable exaggeration to which all of us are prone when detailing events which have had powerful influence in exciting the imaginative faculties.|3|0|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Another reason was, that the incidents to be narrated were of a nature so positively marvellous, that, unsupported as my assertions must necessarily be (except by the evidence of a single individual, and he a half-breed Indian), I could only hope for belief among my family, and those of my friends who have had reason, through life, to put faith in my veracity–the probability being that the public at large would regard what I should put forth as merely an impudent and ingenious fiction.|4|0|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A distrust in my own abilities as a writer was, nevertheless, one of the principal causes which prevented me from complying with the suggestion of my advisers.|5|0|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Among those gentlemen in Virginia who expressed the greatest interest in my statement, more particularly in regard to that portion of it which related to the Antarctic Ocean, was Mr. Poe, lately editor of the Southern Literary Messenger, a monthly magazine, published by Mr. Thomas W. White, in the city of Richmond.|0|1|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He strongly advised me, among others, to prepare at once a full account of what I had seen and undergone, and trust to the shrewdness and common sense of the public–insisting, with great plausibility, that however roughly, as regards mere authorship, my book should be got up, its very uncouthness, if there were any, would give it all the better chance of being received as truth.|1|1|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Notwithstanding this representation, I did not make up my mind to do as he suggested.|0|2|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He afterward proposed (finding that I would not stir in the matter) that I should allow him to draw up, in his own words, a narrative of the earlier portion of my adventures, from facts afforded by myself, publishing it in the Southern Messenger under the garb of fiction.|1|2|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To this, perceiving no objection, I consented, stipulating only that my real name should be retained.|2|2|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Two numbers of the pretended fiction appeared, consequently, in the Messenger for January and February, (1837), and, in order that it might certainly be regarded as fiction, the name of Mr. Poe was affixed to the articles in the table of contents of the magazine.|3|2|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The manner in which this ruse was received has induced me at length to undertake a regular compilation and publication of the adventures in question; for I found that, in spite of the air of fable which had been so ingeniously thrown around that portion of my statement which appeared in the Messenger (without altering or distorting a single fact), the public were still not at all disposed to receive it as fable, and several letters were sent to Mr. P.'s address, distinctly expressing a conviction to the contrary.|0|3|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I thence concluded that the facts of my narrative would prove of such a nature as to carry with them sufficient evidence of their own authenticity, and that I had consequently little to fear on the score of popular incredulity.|1|3|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This expose being made, it will be seen at once how much of what follows I claim to be my own writing; and it will also be understood that no fact is misrepresented in the first few pages which were written by Mr. Poe.|0|4|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Even to those readers who have not seen the Messenger, it will be unnecessary to point out where his portion ends and my own commences; the difference in point of style will be readily perceived.|1|4|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax

MY name is Arthur Gordon Pym.|0|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My father was a respectable trader in sea-stores at Nantucket, where I was born.|1|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My maternal grandfather was an attorney in good practice.|2|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He was fortunate in every thing, and had speculated very successfully in stocks of the Edgarton New Bank, as it was formerly called.|3|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
By these and other means he had managed to lay by a tolerable sum of money.|4|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He was more attached to myself, I believe, than to any other person in the world, and I expected to inherit the most of his property at his death.|5|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He sent me, at six years of age, to the school of old Mr. Ricketts, a gentleman with only one arm and of eccentric manners–he is well known to almost every person who has visited New Bedford.|6|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I stayed at his school until I was sixteen, when I left him for Mr. E. Ronald's academy on the hill.|7|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Here I became intimate with the son of Mr. Barnard, a sea-captain, who generally sailed in the employ of Lloyd and Vredenburgh–Mr. Barnard is also very well known in New Bedford, and has many relations, I am certain, in Edgarton.|8|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
His son was named Augustus, and he was nearly two years older than myself.|9|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He had been on a whaling voyage with his father in the John Donaldson, and was always talking to me of his adventures in the South Pacific Ocean.|10|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I used frequently to go home with him, and remain all day, and sometimes all night.|11|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We occupied the same bed, and he would be sure to keep me awake until almost light, telling me stories of the natives of the Island of Tinian, and other places he had visited in his travels.|12|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At last I could not help being interested in what he said, and by degrees I felt the greatest desire to go to sea.|13|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I owned a sailboat called the Ariel, and worth about seventy-five dollars.|14|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
She had a half-deck or cuddy, and was rigged sloop-fashion–I forget her tonnage, but she would hold ten persons without much crowding.|15|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In this boat we were in the habit of going on some of the maddest freaks in the world; and, when I now think of them, it appears to me a thousand wonders that I am alive to-day.|16|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I will relate one of these adventures by way of introduction to a longer and more momentous narrative.|0|7|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
One night there was a party at Mr. Barnard's, and both Augustus and myself were not a little intoxicated toward the close of it.|1|7|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As usual, in such cases, I took part of his bed in preference to going home.|2|7|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He went to sleep, as I thought, very quietly (it being near one when the party broke up), and without saying a word on his favorite topic.|3|7|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It might have been half an hour from the time of our getting in bed, and I was just about falling into a doze, when he suddenly started up, and swore with a terrible oath that he would not go to sleep for any Arthur Pym in Christendom, when there was so glorious a breeze from the southwest.|4|7|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I never was so astonished in my life, not knowing what he intended, and thinking that the wines and liquors he had drunk had set him entirely beside himself.|5|7|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He proceeded to talk very coolly, however, saying he knew that I supposed him intoxicated, but that he was never more sober in his life.|6|7|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He was only tired, he added, of lying in bed on such a fine night like a dog, and was determined to get up and dress, and go out on a frolic with the boat.|7|7|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I can hardly tell what possessed me, but the words were no sooner out of his mouth than I felt a thrill of the greatest excitement and pleasure, and thought his mad idea one of the most delightful and most reasonable things in the world.|8|7|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was blowing almost a gale, and the weather was very cold–it being late in October.|9|7|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I sprang out of bed, nevertheless, in a kind of ecstasy, and told him I was quite as brave as himself, and quite as tired as he was of lying in bed like a dog, and quite as ready for any fun or frolic as any Augustus Barnard in Nantucket.|10|7|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We lost no time in getting on our clothes and hurrying down to the boat.|0|8|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
She was lying at the old decayed wharf by the lumber-yard of Pankey &amp; Co., and almost thumping her side out against the rough logs.|1|8|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Augustus got into her and bailed her, for she was nearly half full of water.|2|8|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This being done, we hoisted jib and mainsail, kept full, and started boldly out to sea.|3|8|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The wind, as I before said, blew freshly from the southwest.|0|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The night was very clear and cold.|1|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Augustus had taken the helm, and I stationed myself by the mast, on the deck of the cuddy.|2|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We flew along at a great rate–neither of us having said a word since casting loose from the wharf.|3|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I now asked my companion what course he intended to steer, and what time he thought it probable we should get back.|4|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"He whistled for a few minutes, and then said crustily: ""I am going to sea–you may go home if you think proper""."|5|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Turning my eyes upon him, I perceived at once that, in spite of his assumed nonchalance, he was greatly agitated.|6|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I could see him distinctly by the light of the moon–his face was paler than any marble, and his hand shook so excessively that he could scarcely retain hold of the tiller.|7|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I found that something had gone wrong, and became seriously alarmed.|8|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At this period I knew little about the management of a boat, and was now depending entirely upon the nautical skill of my friend.|9|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The wind, too, had suddenly increased, as we were fast getting out of the lee of the land–still I was ashamed to betray any trepidation, and for almost half an hour maintained a resolute silence.|10|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I could stand it no longer, however, and spoke to Augustus about the propriety of turning back.|11|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As before, it was nearly a minute before he made answer, or took any notice of my suggestion.|12|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"""By-and-by,"" said he at length–""time enough–home by-and-by""."|13|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I had expected a similar reply, but there was something in the tone of these words which filled me with an indescribable feeling of dread.|14|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I again looked at the speaker attentively.|15|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
His lips were perfectly livid, and his knees shook so violently together that he seemed scarcely able to stand.|16|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"""For God's sake, Augustus,"" I screamed, now heartily frightened, ""what ails you?"|17|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–what is the matter?|18|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"–what are you going to do""?"|19|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"""Matter""!"|20|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"he stammered, in the greatest apparent surprise, letting go the tiller at the same moment, and falling forward into the bottom of the boat–""matter–why, nothing is the–matter–going home–d-d-don't you see""?"|21|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The whole truth now flashed upon me.|22|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I flew to him and raised him up.|23|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He was drunk–beastly drunk–he could no longer either stand, speak or see.|24|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
His eyes were perfectly glazed; and as I let him go in the extremity of my despair, he rolled like a mere log into the bilge-water, from which I had lifted him.|25|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was evident that, during the evening, he had drunk far more than I suspected, and that his conduct in bed had been the result of a highly-concentrated state of intoxication–a state which, like madness, frequently enables the victim to imitate the outward demeanour of one in perfect possession of his senses.|26|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The coolness of the night air, however, had had its usual effect–the mental energy began to yield before its influence–and the confused perception which he no doubt then had of his perilous situation had assisted in hastening the catastrophe.|27|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He was now thoroughly insensible, and there was no probability that he would be otherwise for many hours.|28|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It is hardly possible to conceive the extremity of my terror.|0|10|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The fumes of the wine lately taken had evaporated, leaving me doubly timid and irresolute.|1|10|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I knew that I was altogether incapable of managing the boat, and that a fierce wind and strong ebb tide were hurrying us to destruction.|2|10|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A storm was evidently gathering behind us; we had neither compass nor provisions; and it was clear that, if we held our present course, we should be out of sight of land before daybreak.|3|10|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
These thoughts, with a crowd of others equally fearful, flashed through my mind with a bewildering rapidity, and for some moments paralyzed me beyond the possibility of making any exertion.|4|10|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The boat was going through the water at a terrible rate–full before the wind- no reef in either jib or mainsail–running her bows completely under the foam.|5|10|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was a thousand wonders she did not broach to–Augustus having let go the tiller, as I said before, and I being too much agitated to think of taking it myself.|6|10|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
By good luck, however, she kept steady, and gradually I recovered some degree of presence of mind.|7|10|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Still the wind was increasing fearfully, and whenever we rose from a plunge forward, the sea behind fell combing over our counter, and deluged us with water.|8|10|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I was so utterly benumbed, too, in every limb, as to be nearly unconscious of sensation.|9|10|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At length I summoned up the resolution of despair, and rushing to the mainsail let it go by the run.|10|10|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As might have been expected, it flew over the bows, and, getting drenched with water, carried away the mast short off by the board.|11|10|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This latter accident alone saved me from instant destruction.|12|10|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Under the jib only, I now boomed along before the wind, shipping heavy seas occasionally over the counter, but relieved from the terror of immediate death.|13|10|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I took the helm, and breathed with greater freedom as I found that there yet remained to us a chance of ultimate escape.|14|10|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Augustus still lay senseless in the bottom of the boat; and as there was imminent danger of his drowning (the water being nearly a foot deep just where he fell), I contrived to raise him partially up, and keep him in a sitting position, by passing a rope round his waist, and lashing it to a ringbolt in the deck of the cuddy.|15|10|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having thus arranged every thing as well as I could in my chilled and agitated condition, I recommended myself to God, and made up my mind to bear whatever might happen with all the fortitude in my power.|16|10|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Hardly had I come to this resolution, when, suddenly, a loud and long scream or yell, as if from the throats of a thousand demons, seemed to pervade the whole atmosphere around and above the boat.|0|11|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Never while I live shall I forget the intense agony of terror I experienced at that moment.|1|11|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My hair stood erect on my head–I felt the blood congealing in my veins–my heart ceased utterly to beat, and without having once raised my eyes to learn the source of my alarm, I tumbled headlong and insensible upon the body of my fAllan companion.|2|11|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I found myself, upon reviving, in the cabin of a large whaling-ship (the Penguin) bound to Nantucket.|0|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Several persons were standing over me, and Augustus, paler than death, was busily occupied in chafing my hands.|1|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon seeing me open my eyes, his exclamations of gratitude and joy excited alternate laughter and tears from the rough-looking personages who were present.|2|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The mystery of our being in existence was now soon explained.|3|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We had been run down by the whaling-ship, which was close-hauled, beating up to Nantucket with every sail she could venture to set, and consequently running almost at right angles to our own course.|4|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Several men were on the look-out forward, but did not perceive our boat until it was an impossibility to avoid coming in contact–their shouts of warning upon seeing us were what so terribly alarmed me.|5|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The huge ship, I was told, rode immediately over us with as much ease as our own little vessel would have passed over a feather, and without the least perceptible impediment to her progress.|6|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Not a scream arose from the deck of the victim–there was a slight grating sound to be heard mingling with the roar of wind and water, as the frail bark which was swallowed up rubbed for a moment along the keel of her destroyer–but this was all.|7|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Thinking our boat (which it will be remembered was dismasted) some mere shell cut adrift as useless, the captain (Captain E. T. V. Block, of New London) was for proceeding on his course without troubling himself further about the matter.|8|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Luckily, there were two of the look-out who swore positively to having seen some person at our helm, and represented the possibility of yet saving him.|9|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"A discussion ensued, when Block grew angry, and, after a while, said that ""it was no business of his to be eternally watching for egg-shells; that the ship should not put about for any such nonsense; and if there was a man run down, it was nobody's fault but Henderson, the first mate, now took the matter up, being justly indignant, as well as the whole ship's crew, at a speech evincing so base a degree of heartless atrocity."|10|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He spoke plainly, seeing himself upheld by the men, told the captain he considered him a fit subject for the gallows, and that he would disobey his orders if he were hanged for it the moment he set his foot on shore.|11|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He strode aft, jostling Block (who turned pale and made no answer) on one side, and seizing the helm, gave the word, in a firm voice, Hard-a-lee!|12|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The men flew to their posts, and the ship went cleverly about.|13|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
All this had occupied nearly five minutes, and it was supposed to be hardly within the bounds of possibility that any individual could be saved–allowing any to have been on board the boat.|14|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Yet, as the reader has seen, both Augustus and myself were rescued; and our deliverance seemed to have been brought about by two of those almost inconceivable pieces of good fortune which are attributed by the wise and pious to the special interference of Providence.|15|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
While the ship was yet in stays, the mate lowered the jolly-boat and jumped into her with the very two men, I believe, who spoke up as having seen me at the helm.|0|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They had just left the lee of the vessel (the moon still shining brightly) when she made a long and heavy roll to windward, and Henderson, at the same moment, starting up in his seat bawled out to his crew to back water.|1|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He would say nothing else–repeating his cry impatiently, back water!|2|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
black water!|3|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The men put back as speedily as possible, but by this time the ship had gone round, and gotten fully under headway, although all hands on board were making great exertions to take in sail.|4|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In despite of the danger of the attempt, the mate clung to the main-chains as soon as they came within his reach.|5|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Another huge lurch now brought the starboard side of the vessel out of water nearly as far as her keel, when the cause of his anxiety was rendered obvious enough.|6|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The body of a man was seen to be affixed in the most singular manner to the smooth and shining bottom (the Penguin was coppered and copper-fastened), and beating violently against it with every movement of the hull.|7|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
After several ineffectual efforts, made during the lurches of the ship, and at the imminent risk of swamping the boat I was finally disengaged from my perilous situation and taken on board–for the body proved to be my own.|8|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It appeared that one of the timber-bolts having started and broken a passage through the copper, it had arrested my progress as I passed under the ship, and fastened me in so extraordinary a manner to her bottom.|9|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The head of the bolt had made its way through the collar of the green baize jacket I had on, and through the back part of my neck, forcing itself out between two sinews and just below the right ear.|10|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I was immediately put to bed–although life seemed to be totally extinct.|11|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There was no surgeon on board.|12|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The captain, however, treated me with every attention–to make amends, I presume, in the eyes of his crew, for his atrocious behaviour in the previous portion of the adventure.|13|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In the meantime, Henderson had again put off from the ship, although the wind was now blowing almost a hurricane.|0|14|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He had not been gone many minutes when he fell in with some fragments of our boat, and shortly afterward one of the men with him asserted that he could distinguish a cry for help at intervals amid the roaring of the tempest.|1|14|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This induced the hardy seamen to persevere in their search for more than half an hour, although repeated signals to return were made them by Captain Block, and although every moment on the water in so frail a boat was fraught to them with the most imminent and deadly peril.|2|14|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Indeed, it is nearly impossible to conceive how the small jolly they were in could have escaped destruction for a single instant.|3|14|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
She was built, however, for the whaling service, and was fitted, as I have since had reason to believe, with air-boxes, in the manner of some life-boats used on the coast of Wales.|4|14|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
After searching in vain for about the period of time just mentioned, it was determined to get back to the ship.|0|15|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They had scarcely made this resolve when a feeble cry arose from a dark object that floated rapidly by.|1|15|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They pursued and soon overtook it.|2|15|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It proved to be the entire deck of the Ariel's cuddy.|3|15|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Augustus was struggling near it, apparently in the last agonies.|4|15|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon getting hold of him it was found that he was attached by a rope to the floating timber.|5|15|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This rope, it will be remembered, I had myself tied around his waist, and made fast to a ringbolt, for the purpose of keeping him in an upright position, and my so doing, it appeared, had been ultimately the means of preserving his life.|6|15|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The Ariel was slightly put together, and in going down her frame naturally went to pieces; the deck of the cuddy, as might have been expected, was lifted, by the force of the water rushing in, entirely from the main timbers, and floated (with other fragments, no doubt) to the surface–Augustus was buoyed up with it, and thus escaped a terrible death.|7|15|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was more than an hour after being taken on board the Penguin before he could give any account of himself, or be made to comprehend the nature of the accident which had befAllan our boat.|0|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At length he became thoroughly aroused, and spoke much of his sensations while in the water.|1|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon his first attaining any degree of consciousness, he found himself beneath the surface, whirling round and round with inconceivable rapidity, and with a rope wrapped in three or four folds tightly about his neck.|2|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In an instant afterward he felt himself going rapidly upward, when, his head striking violently against a hard substance, he again relapsed into insensibility.|3|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon once more reviving he was in fuller possession of his reason–this was still, however, in the greatest degree clouded and confused.|4|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He now knew that some accident had occurred, and that he was in the water, although his mouth was above the surface, and he could breathe with some freedom.|5|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Possibly, at this period the deck was drifting rapidly before the wind, and drawing him after it, as he floated upon his back.|6|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Of course, as long as he could have retained this position, it would have been nearly impossible that he should be drowned.|7|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Presently a surge threw him directly athwart the deck, and this post he endeavored to maintain, screaming at intervals for help.|8|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
just before he was discovered by Mr. Henderson, he had been obliged to relax his hold through exhaustion, and, falling into the sea, had given himself up for lost.|9|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
During the whole period of his struggles he had not the faintest recollection of the Ariel, nor of the matters in connexion with the source of his disaster.|10|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A vague feeling of terror and despair had taken entire possession of his faculties.|11|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When he was finally picked up, every power of his mind had failed him; and, as before said, it was nearly an hour after getting on board the Penguin before he became fully aware of his condition.|12|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In regard to myself–I was resuscitated from a state bordering very nearly upon death (and after every other means had been tried in vain for three hours and a half) by vigorous friction with flannels bathed in hot oil–a proceeding suggested by Augustus.|13|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The wound in my neck, although of an ugly appearance, proved of little real consequence, and I soon recovered from its effects.|14|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The Penguin got into port about nine o'clock in the morning, after encountering one of the severest gales ever experienced off Nantucket.|0|17|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Both Augustus and myself managed to appear at Mr. Barnard's in time for breakfast–which, luckily, was somewhat late, owing to the party over night.|1|17|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I suppose all at the table were too much fatigued themselves to notice our jaded appearance–of course, it would not have borne a very rigid scrutiny.|2|17|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Schoolboys, however, can accomplish wonders in the way of deception, and I verily believe not one of our friends in Nantucket had the slightest suspicion that the terrible story told by some sailors in town of their having run down a vessel at sea and drowned some thirty or forty poor devils, had reference either to the Ariel, my companion, or myself.|3|17|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We two have since very frequently talked the matter over–but never without a shudder.|4|17|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In one of our conversations Augustus frankly confessed to me, that in his whole life he had at no time experienced so excruciating a sense of dismay, as when on board our little boat he first discovered the extent of his intoxication, and felt himself sinking beneath its influence.|5|17|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In no affairs of mere prejudice, pro or con, do we deduce inferences with entire certainty, even from the most simple data.|0|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It might be supposed that a catastrophe such as I have just related would have effectually cooled my incipient passion for the sea.|1|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the contrary, I never experienced a more ardent longing for the wild adventures incident to the life of a navigator than within a week after our miraculous deliverance.|2|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This short period proved amply long enough to erase from my memory the shadows, and bring out in vivid light all the pleasurably exciting points of color, all the picturesqueness, of the late perilous accident.|3|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My conversations with Augustus grew daily more frequent and more intensely full of interest.|4|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He had a manner of relating his stories of the ocean (more than one half of which I now suspect to have been sheer fabrications) well adapted to have weight with one of my enthusiastic temperament and somewhat gloomy although glowing imagination.|5|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It is strange, too, that he most strongly enlisted my feelings in behalf of the life of a seaman, when he depicted his more terrible moments of suffering and despair.|6|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For the bright side of the painting I had a limited sympathy.|7|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My visions were of shipwreck and famine; of death or captivity among barbarian hordes; of a lifetime dragged out in sorrow and tears, upon some gray and desolate rock, in an ocean unapproachable and unknown.|8|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Such visions or desires–for they amounted to desires–are common, I have since been assured, to the whole numerous race of the melancholy among men–at the time of which I speak I regarded them only as prophetic glimpses of a destiny which I felt myself in a measure bound to fulfil.|9|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Augustus thoroughly entered into my state of mind.|10|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It is probable, indeed, that our intimate communion had resulted in a partial interchange of character.|11|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
About eighteen months after the period of the Ariel's disaster, the firm of Lloyd and Vredenburgh (a house connected in some manner with the Messieurs Enderby, I believe, of Liverpool) were engaged in repairing and fitting out the brig Grampus for a whaling voyage.|0|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
She was an old hulk, and scarcely seaworthy when all was done to her that could be done.|1|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I hardly know why she was chosen in preference to other good vessels belonging to the same owners–but so it was.|2|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Mr. Barnard was appointed to command her, and Augustus was going with him.|3|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
While the brig was getting ready, he frequently urged upon me the excellency of the opportunity now offered for indulging my desire of travel.|4|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He found me by no means an unwilling listener–yet the matter could not be so easily arranged.|5|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My father made no direct opposition; but my mother went into hysterics at the bare mention of the design; and, more than all, my grandfather, from whom I expected much, vowed to cut me off with a shilling if I should ever broach the subject to him again.|6|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
These difficulties, however, so far from abating my desire, only added fuel to the flame.|7|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I determined to go at all hazards; and, having made known my intentions to Augustus, we set about arranging a plan by which it might be accomplished.|8|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In the meantime I forbore speaking to any of my relations in regard to the voyage, and, as I busied myself ostensibly with my usual studies, it was supposed that I had abandoned the design.|9|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I have since frequently examined my conduct on this occasion with sentiments of displeasure as well as of surprise.|10|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The intense hypocrisy I made use of for the furtherance of my project–an hypocrisy pervading every word and action of my life for so long a period of time–could only have been rendered tolerable to myself by the wild and burning expectation with which I looked forward to the fulfilment of my long-cherished visions of travel.|11|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In pursuance of my scheme of deception, I was necessarily obliged to leave much to the management of Augustus, who was employed for the greater part of every day on board the Grampus, attending to some arrangements for his father in the cabin and cabin hold.|0|20|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At night, however, we were sure to have a conference and talk over our hopes.|1|20|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
After nearly a month passed in this manner, without our hitting upon any plan we thought likely to succeed, he told me at last that he had determined upon everything necessary.|2|20|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I had a relation living in New Bedford, a Mr. Ross, at whose house I was in the habit of spending occasionally two or three weeks at a time.|3|20|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The brig was to sail about the middle of June (June, 1827), and it was agreed that, a day or two before her putting to sea, my father was to receive a note, as usual, from Mr. Ross, asking me to come over and spend a fortnight with Robert and Emmet (his sons).|4|20|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Augustus charged himself with the inditing of this note and getting it delivered.|5|20|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having set out as supposed, for New Bedford, I was then to report myself to my companion, who would contrive a hiding-place for me in the Grampus.|6|20|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This hiding-place, he assured me, would be rendered sufficiently comfortable for a residence of many days, during which I was not to make my appearance.|7|20|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When the brig had proceeded so far on her course as to make any turning back a matter out of question, I should then, he said, be formally installed in all the comforts of the cabin; and as to his father, he would only laugh heartily at the joke.|8|20|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Vessels enough would be met with by which a letter might be sent home explaining the adventure to my parents.|9|20|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The middle of June at length arrived, and every thing had been matured.|0|21|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The note was written and delivered, and on a Monday morning I left the house for the New Bedford packet, as supposed.|1|21|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I went, however, straight to Augustus, who was waiting for me at the corner of a street.|2|21|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It had been our original plan that I should keep out of the way until dark, and then slip on board the brig; but, as there was now a thick fog in our favor, it was agreed to lose no time in secreting me.|3|21|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Augustus led the way to the wharf, and I followed at a little distance, enveloped in a thick seaman's cloak, which he had brought with him, so that my person might not be easily recognized.|4|21|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
just as we turned the second corner, after passing Mr. Edmund's well, who should appear, standing right in front of me, and looking me full in the face, but old Mr. Peterson, my grandfather.|5|21|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"""Why, bless my soul, Gordon,"" said he, after a long pause, ""why, why,–whose dirty cloak is that you have on""?"|6|21|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"""Sir""!"|7|21|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"I replied, assuming, as well as I could, in the exigency of the moment, an air of offended surprise, and talking in the gruffest of all imaginable tones–""sir!"|8|21|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"you are a sum'mat mistaken–my name, in the first place, bee'nt nothing at all like Goddin, and I'd want you for to know better, you blackguard, than to call my new obercoat a darty one""."|9|21|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For my life I could hardly refrain from screaming with laughter at the odd manner in which the old gentleman received this handsome rebuke.|10|21|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He started back two or three steps, turned first pale and then excessively red, threw up his spectacles, then, putting them down, ran full tilt at me, with his umbrella uplifted.|11|21|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
After this narrow escape we proceeded with greater caution, and arrived at our point of destination in safety.|0|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There were only one or two of the hands on board, and these were busy forward, doing something to the forecastle combings.|1|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Captain Barnard, we knew very well, was engaged at Lloyd and Vredenburgh's, and would remain there until late in the evening, so we had little to apprehend on his account.|2|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Augustus went first up the vessel's side, and in a short while I followed him, without being noticed by the men at work.|3|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We proceeded at once into the cabin, and found no person there.|4|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was fitted up in the most comfortable style–a thing somewhat unusual in a whaling-vessel.|5|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There were four very excellent staterooms, with wide and convenient berths.|6|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There was also a large stove, I took notice, and a remarkably thick and valuable carpet covering the floor of both the cabin and staterooms.|7|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The ceiling was full seven feet high, and, in short, every thing appeared of a more roomy and agreeable nature than I had anticipated.|8|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Augustus, however, would allow me but little time for observation, insisting upon the necessity of my concealing myself as soon as possible.|9|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He led the way into his own stateroom, which was on the starboard side of the brig, and next to the bulkheads.|10|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon entering, he closed the door and bolted it.|11|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I thought I had never seen a nicer little room than the one in which I now found myself.|12|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was about ten feet long, and had only one berth, which, as I said before, was wide and convenient.|13|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In that portion of the closet nearest the bulkheads there was a space of four feet square, containing a table, a chair, and a set of hanging shelves full of books, chiefly books of voyages and travels.|14|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There were many other little comforts in the room, among which I ought not to forget a kind of safe or refrigerator, in which Augustus pointed out to me a host of delicacies, both in the eating and drinking department.|15|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He now pressed with his knuckles upon a certain spot of the carpet in one corner of the space just mentioned, letting me know that a portion of the flooring, about sixteen inches square, had been neatly cut out and again adjusted.|0|23|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As he pressed, this portion rose up at one end sufficiently to allow the passage of his finger beneath.|1|23|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In this manner he raised the mouth of the trap (to which the carpet was still fastened by tacks), and I found that it led into the after hold.|2|23|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He next lit a small taper by means of a phosphorous match, and, placing the light in a dark lantern, descended with it through the opening, bidding me follow.|3|23|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I did so, and be then pulled the cover upon the hole, by means of a nail driven into the under side–the carpet, of course, resuming its original position on the floor of the stateroom, and all traces of the aperture being concealed.|4|23|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The taper gave out so feeble a ray that it was with the greatest difficulty I could grope my way through the confused mass of lumber among which I now found myself.|0|24|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
By degrees, however, my eyes became accustomed to the gloom, and I proceeded with less trouble, holding on to the skirts of my friend's coat.|1|24|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He brought me, at length, after creeping and winding through innumerable narrow passages, to an iron-bound box, such as is used sometimes for packing fine earthenware.|2|24|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was nearly four feet high, and full six long, but very narrow.|3|24|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Two large empty oil-casks lay on the top of it, and above these, again, a vast quantity of straw matting, piled up as high as the floor of the cabin.|4|24|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In every other direction around was wedged as closely as possible, even up to the ceiling, a complete chaos of almost every species of ship-furniture, together with a heterogeneous medley of crates, hampers, barrels, and bales, so that it seemed a matter no less than miraculous that we had discovered any passage at all to the box.|5|24|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I afterward found that Augustus had purposely arranged the stowage in this hold with a view to affording me a thorough concealment, having had only one assistant in the labour, a man not going out in the brig.|6|24|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My companion now showed me that one of the ends of the box could be removed at pleasure.|0|25|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He slipped it aside and displayed the interior, at which I was excessively amused.|1|25|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A mattress from one of the cabin berths covered the whole of its bottom, and it contained almost every article of mere comfort which could be crowded into so small a space, allowing me, at the same time, sufficient room for my accommodation, either in a sitting position or lying at full length.|2|25|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Among other things, there were some books, pen, ink, and paper, three blankets, a large jug full of water, a keg of sea-biscuit, three or four immense Bologna sausages, an enormous ham, a cold leg of roast mutton, and half a dozen bottles of cordials and liqueurs.|3|25|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I proceeded immediately to take possession of my little apartment, and this with feelings of higher satisfaction, I am sure, than any monarch ever experienced upon entering a new palace.|4|25|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Augustus now pointed out to me the method of fastening the open end of the box, and then, holding the taper close to the deck, showed me a piece of dark whipcord lying along it.|5|25|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This, he said, extended from my hiding-place throughout an the necessary windings among the lumber, to a nail which was driven into the deck of the hold, immediately beneath the trap-door leading into his stateroom.|6|25|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
By means of this cord I should be enabled readily to trace my way out without his guidance, provided any unlooked-for accident should render such a step necessary.|7|25|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He now took his departure, leaving with me the lantern, together with a copious supply of tapers and phosphorous, and promising to pay me a visit as often as he could contrive to do so without observation.|8|25|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This was on the seventeenth of June.|9|25|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I remained three days and nights (as nearly as I could guess) in my hiding-place without getting out of it at all, except twice for the purpose of stretching my limbs by standing erect between two crates just opposite the opening.|0|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
During the whole period I saw nothing of Augustus; but this occasioned me little uneasiness, as I knew the brig was expected to put to sea every hour, and in the bustle he would not easily find opportunities of coming down to me.|1|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At length I heard the trap open and shut.|2|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
and presently he called in a low voice, asking if all was well, and if there was any thing I wanted.|3|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"""Nothing,"" I replied; ""I am as comfortable as can be; when will the brig sail""?"|4|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"""She will be under weigh in less than half an hour,"" he answered."|5|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"""I came to let you know, and for fear you should be uneasy at my absence."|6|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I shall not have a chance of coming down again for some time–perhaps for three or four days more.|7|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
All is going on right aboveboard.|8|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
After I go up and close the trap, do you creep along by the whipcord to where the nail is driven in.|9|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
You will find my watch there–it may be useful to you, as you have no daylight to keep time by.|10|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I suppose you can't tell how long you have been buried–only three days–this is the twentieth.|11|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"I would bring the watch to your box, but am afraid of being missed""."|12|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
With this he went up.|13|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In about an hour after he had gone I distinctly felt the brig in motion, and congratulated myself upon having at length fairly commenced a voyage.|0|27|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Satisfied with this idea, I determined to make my mind as easy as possible, and await the course of events until I should be permitted to exchange the box for the more roomy, although hardly more comfortable, accommodations of the cabin.|1|27|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My first care was to get the watch.|2|27|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Leaving the taper burning, I groped along in the dark, following the cord through windings innumerable, in some of which I discovered that, after toiling a long distance, I was brought back within a foot or two of a former position.|3|27|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At length I reached the nail, and securing the object of my journey, returned with it in safety.|4|27|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I now looked over the books which had been so thoughtfully provided, and selected the expedition of Lewis and Clarke to the mouth of the Columbia.|5|27|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
With this I amused myself for some time, when, growing sleepy, I extinguished the light with great care, and soon fell into a sound slumber.|6|27|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon awakening I felt strangely confused in mind, and some time elapsed before I could bring to recollection all the various circumstances of my situation.|0|28|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
By degrees, however, I remembered all.|1|28|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Striking a light, I looked at the watch; but it was run down, and there were, consequently, no means of determining how long I slept.|2|28|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My limbs were greatly cramped, and I was forced to relieve them by standing between the crates.|3|28|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Presently feeling an almost ravenous appetite, I bethought myself of the cold mutton, some of which I had eaten just before going to sleep, and found excellent.|4|28|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
What was my astonishment in discovering it to be in a state of absolute putrefaction!|5|28|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This circumstance occasioned me great disquietude; for, connecting it with the disorder of mind I experienced upon awakening, I began to suppose that I must have slept for an inordinately long period of time.|6|28|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The close atmosphere of the hold might have had something to do with this, and might, in the end, be productive of the most serious results.|7|28|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My head ached excessively; I fancied that I drew every breath with difficulty; and, in short, I was oppressed with a multitude of gloomy feelings.|8|28|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Still I could not venture to make any disturbance by opening the trap or otherwise, and, having wound up the watch, contented myself as well as possible.|9|28|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Throughout the whole of the next tedious twenty-four hours no person came to my relief, and I could not help accusing Augustus of the grossest inattention.|0|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
What alarmed me chiefly was, that the water in my jug was reduced to about half a pint, and I was suffering much from thirst, having eaten freely of the Bologna sausages after the loss of my mutton.|1|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I became very uneasy, and could no longer take any interest in my books.|2|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I was overpowered, too, with a desire to sleep, yet trembled at the thought of indulging it, lest there might exist some pernicious influence, like that of burning charcoal, in the confined air of the hold.|3|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In the meantime the roll of the brig told me that we were far in the main ocean, and a dull humming sound, which reached my ears as if from an immense distance, convinced me no ordinary gale was blowing.|4|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I could not imagine a reason for the absence of Augustus.|5|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We were surely far enough advanced on our voyage to allow of my going up.|6|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Some accident might have happened to him–but I could think of none which would account for his suffering me to remain so long a prisoner, except, indeed, his having suddenly died or fAllan overboard, and upon this idea I could not dwell with any degree of patience.|7|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was possible that we had been baffled by head winds, and were still in the near vicinity of Nantucket.|8|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This notion, however, I was forced to abandon; for such being the case, the brig must have frequently gone about; and I was entirely satisfied, from her continual inclination to the larboard, that she had been sailing all along with a steady breeze on her starboard quarter.|9|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Besides, granting that we were still in the neighborhood of the island, why should not Augustus have visited me and informed me of the circumstance?|10|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Pondering in this manner upon the difficulties of my solitary and cheerless condition, I resolved to wait yet another twenty-four hours, when, if no relief were obtained, I would make my way to the trap, and endeavour either to hold a parley with my friend, or get at least a little fresh air through the opening, and a further supply of water from the stateroom.|11|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
While occupied with this thought, however, I fell in spite of every exertion to the contrary, into a state of profound sleep, or rather stupor.|12|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My dreams were of the most terrific description.|13|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Every species of calamity and horror befell me.|14|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Among other miseries I was smothered to death between huge pillows, by demons of the most ghastly and ferocious aspect.|15|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Immense serpents held me in their embrace, and looked earnestly in my face with their fearfully shining eyes.|16|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Then deserts, limitless, and of the most forlorn and awe-inspiring character, spread themselves out before me.|17|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Immensely tall trunks of trees, gray and leafless, rose up in endless succession as far as the eye could reach.|18|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Their roots were concealed in wide-spreading morasses, whose dreary water lay intensely black, still, and altogether terrible, beneath.|19|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
And the strange trees seemed endowed with a human vitality, and waving to and fro their skeleton arms, were crying to the silent waters for mercy, in the shrill and piercing accents of the most acute agony and despair.|20|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The scene changed; and I stood, naked and alone, amidst the burning sand-plains of Sahara.|21|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At my feet lay crouched a fierce lion of the tropics.|22|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Suddenly his wild eyes opened and fell upon me.|23|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
With a conculsive bound he sprang to his feet, and laid bare his horrible teeth.|24|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In another instant there burst from his red throat a roar like the thunder of the firmament, and I fell impetuously to the earth.|25|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Stifling in a paroxysm of terror, I at last found myself partially awake.|26|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My dream, then, was not all a dream.|27|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Now, at least, I was in possession of my senses.|28|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The paws of some huge and real monster were pressing heavily upon my bosom–his hot breath was in my ear–and his white and ghastly fangs were gleaming upon me through the gloom.|29|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Had a thousand lives hung upon the movement of a limb or the utterance of a syllable, I could have neither stirred nor spoken.|0|30|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The beast, whatever it was, retained his position without attempting any immediate violence, while I lay in an utterly helpless, and, I fancied, a dying condition beneath him.|1|30|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I felt that my powers of body and mind were fast leaving me–in a word, that I was perishing, and perishing of sheer fright.|2|30|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My brain swam–I grew deadly sick–my vision failed–even the glaring eyeballs above me grew dim.|3|30|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Making a last strong effort, I at length breathed a faint ejaculation to God, and resigned myself to die.|4|30|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The sound of my voice seemed to arouse all the latent fury of the animal.|5|30|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He precipitated himself at full length upon my body; but what was my astonishment, when, with a long and low whine, he commenced licking my face and hands with the greatest eagerness, and with the most extravagant demonstration of affection and joy!|6|30|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I was bewildered, utterly lost in amazement–but I could not forget the peculiar whine of my Newfoundland dog Tiger, and the odd manner of his caresses I well knew.|7|30|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was he.|8|30|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I experienced a sudden rush of blood to my temples–a giddy and overpowering sense of deliverance and reanimation.|9|30|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I rose hurriedly from the mattress upon which I had been lying, and, throwing myself upon the neck of my faithful follower and friend, relieved the long oppression of my bosom in a flood of the most passionate tears.|10|30|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As upon a former occasion my conceptions were in a state of the greatest indistinctness and confusion after leaving the mattress.|0|31|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For a long time I found it nearly impossible to connect any ideas; but, by very slow degrees, my thinking faculties returned, and I again called to memory the several incidents of my condition.|1|31|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For the presence of Tiger I tried in vain to account; and after busying myself with a thousand different conjectures respecting him, was forced to content myself with rejoicing that he was with me to share my dreary solitude, and render me comfort by his caresses.|2|31|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Most people love their dogs, but for Tiger I had an affection far more ardent than common; and never, certainly, did any creature more truly deserve it.|3|31|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For seven years he had been my inseparable companion, and in a multitude of instances had given evidence of all the noble qualities for which we value the animal.|4|31|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I had rescued him, when a puppy, from the clutches of a malignant little villain in Nantucket who was leading him, with a rope around his neck, to the water; and the grown dog repaid the obligation, about three years afterward, by saving me from the bludgeon of a street robber.|5|31|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Getting now hold of the watch, I found, upon applying it to my ear, that it had again run down; but at this I was not at all surprised, being convinced, from the peculiar state of my feelings, that I had slept, as before, for a very long period of time, how long, it was of course impossible to say.|0|32|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I was burning up with fever, and my thirst was almost intolerable.|1|32|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I felt about the box for my little remaining supply of water, for I had no light, the taper having burnt to the socket of the lantern, and the phosphorus-box not coming readily to hand.|2|32|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon finding the jug, however, I discovered it to be empty–Tiger, no doubt, having been tempted to drink it, as well as to devour the remnant of mutton, the bone of which lay, well picked, by the opening of the box.|3|32|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The spoiled meat I could well spare, but my heart sank as I thought of the water.|4|32|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I was feeble in the extreme–so much so that I shook all over, as with an ague, at the slightest movement or exertion.|5|32|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To add to my troubles, the brig was pitching and rolling with great violence, and the oil-casks which lay upon my box were in momentary danger of falling down, so as to block up the only way of ingress or egress.|6|32|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I felt, also, terrible sufferings from sea-sickness.|7|32|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
These considerations determined me to make my way, at all hazards, to the trap, and obtain immediate relief, before I should be incapacitated from doing so altogether.|8|32|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having come to this resolve, I again felt about for the phosphorus-box and tapers.|9|32|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The former I found after some little trouble; but, not discovering the tapers as soon as I had expected (for I remembered very nearly the spot in which I had placed them), I gave up the search for the present, and bidding Tiger lie quiet, began at once my journey toward the trap.|10|32|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In this attempt my great feebleness became more than ever apparent.|0|33|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was with the utmost difficulty I could crawl along at all, and very frequently my limbs sank suddenly from beneath me; when, falling prostrate on my face, I would remain for some minutes in a state bordering on insensibility.|1|33|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Still I struggled forward by slow degrees, dreading every moment that I should swoon amid the narrow and intricate windings of the lumber, in which event I had nothing but death to expect as the result.|2|33|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At length, upon making a push forward with all the energy I could command, I struck my forehead violently against the sharp corner of an iron-bound crate.|3|33|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The accident only stunned me for a few moments; but I found, to my inexpressible grief, that the quick and violent roll of the vessel had thrown the crate entirely across my path, so as effectually to block up the passage.|4|33|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
With my utmost exertions I could not move it a single inch from its position, it being closely wedged in among the surrounding boxes and ship-furniture.|5|33|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It became necessary, therefore, enfeebled as I was, either to leave the guidance of the whipcord and seek out a new passage, or to climb over the obstacle, and resume the path on the other side.|6|33|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The former alternative presented too many difficulties and dangers to be thought of without a shudder.|7|33|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In my present weak state of both mind and body, I should infallibly lose my way if I attempted it, and perish miserably amid the dismal and disgusting labyrinths of the hold.|8|33|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I proceeded, therefore, without hesitation, to summon up all my remaining strength and fortitude, and endeavour, as I best might, to clamber over the crate.|9|33|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon standing erect, with this end in view, I found the undertaking even a more serious task than my fears had led me to imagine.|0|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On each side of the narrow passage arose a complete wall of various heavy lumber, which the least blunder on my part might be the means of bringing down upon my head; or, if this accident did not occur, the path might be effectually blocked up against my return by the descending mass, as it was in front by the obstacle there.|1|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The crate itself was a long and unwieldy box, upon which no foothold could be obtained.|2|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In vain I attempted, by every means in my power, to reach the top, with the hope of being thus enabled to draw myself up.|3|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Had I succeeded in reaching it, it is certain that my strength would have proved utterly inadequate to the task of getting over, and it was better in every respect that I failed.|4|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At length, in a desperate effort to force the crate from its ground, I felt a strong vibration in the side next me.|5|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I thrust my hand eagerly to the edge of the planks, and found that a very large one was loose.|6|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
With my pocket-knife, which, luckily, I had with me, I succeeded, after great labour, in prying it entirely off; and getting it through the aperture, discovered, to my exceeding joy, that there were no boards on the opposite side–in other words, that the top was wanting, it being the bottom through which I had forced my way.|7|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I now met with no important difficulty in proceeding along the line until I finally reached the nail.|8|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
With a beating heart I stood erect, and with a gentle touch pressed against the cover of the trap.|9|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It did not rise as soon as I had expected, and I pressed it with somewhat more determination, still dreading lest some other person than Augustus might be in his state-room.|10|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The door, however, to my astonishment, remained steady, and I became somewhat uneasy, for I knew that it had formerly required but little or no effort to remove it.|11|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I pushed it strongly–it was nevertheless firm: with all my strength–it still did not give way: with rage, with fury, with despair–it set at defiance my utmost efforts; and it was evident, from the unyielding nature of the resistance, that the hole had either been discovered and effectually nailed up, or that some immense weight had been placed upon it, which it was useless to think of removing.|12|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My sensations were those of extreme horror and dismay.|0|35|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In vain I attempted to reason on the probable cause of my being thus entombed.|1|35|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I could summon up no connected chain of reflection, and, sinking on the floor, gave way, unresistingly, to the most gloomy imaginings, in which the dreadful deaths of thirst, famine, suffocation, and premature interment crowded upon me as the prominent disasters to be encountered.|2|35|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At length there returned to me some portion of presence of mind.|3|35|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I arose, and felt with my fingers for the seams or cracks of the aperture.|4|35|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having found them, I examined them closely to ascertain if they emitted any light from the state-room; but none was visible.|5|35|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I then forced the blade of my pen-knife through them, until I met with some hard obstacle.|6|35|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Scraping against it, I discovered it to be a solid mass of iron, which, from its peculiar wavy feel as I passed the blade along it, I concluded to be a chain-cable.|7|35|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The only course now left me was to retrace my way to the box, and there either yield to my sad fate, or try so to tranquilize my mind as to admit of my arranging some plan of escape.|8|35|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I immediately set about the attempt, and succeeded, after innumerable difficulties, in getting back.|9|35|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As I sank, utterly exhausted, upon the mattress, Tiger threw himself at full length by my side, and seemed as if desirous, by his caresses, of consoling me in my troubles, and urging me to bear them with fortitude.|10|35|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The singularity of his behavior at length forcibly arrested my attention.|0|36|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
After licking my face and hands for some minutes, he would suddenly cease doing so, and utter a low whine.|1|36|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon reaching out my hand toward him, I then invariably found him lying on his back, with his paws uplifted.|2|36|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This conduct, so frequently repeated, appeared strange, and I could in no manner account for it.|3|36|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As the dog seemed distressed, I concluded that he had received some injury; and, taking his paws in my hands, I examined them one by one, but found no sign of any hurt.|4|36|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I then supposed him hungry, and gave him a large piece of ham, which he devoured with avidity–afterward, however, resuming his extraordinary manoeuvres.|5|36|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I now imagined that he was suffering, like myself, the torments of thirst, and was about adopting this conclusion as the true one, when the idea occurred to me that I had as yet only examined his paws, and that there might possibly be a wound upon some portion of his body or head.|6|36|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The latter I felt carefully over, but found nothing.|7|36|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On passing my hand, however, along his back, I perceived a slight erection of the hair extending completely across it.|8|36|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Probing this with my finger, I discovered a string, and tracing it up, found that it encircled the whole body.|9|36|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon a closer scrutiny, I came across a small slip of what had the feeling of letter paper, through which the string had been fastened in such a manner as to bring it immediately beneath the left shoulder of the animal.|10|36|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The thought instantly occurred to me that the paper was a note from Augustus, and that some unaccountable accident having happened to prevent his relieving me from my dungeon, he had devised this method of acquainting me with the true state of affairs.|0|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Trembling with eagerness, I now commenced another search for my phosphorus matches and tapers.|1|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I had a confused recollection of having put them carefully away just before falling asleep; and, indeed, previously to my last journey to the trap, I had been able to remember the exact spot where I had deposited them.|2|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But now I endeavored in vain to call it to mind, and busied myself for a full hour in a fruitless and vexatious search for the missing articles; never, surely, was there a more tantalizing state of anxiety and suspense.|3|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At length, while groping about, with my head close to the ballast, near the opening of the box, and outside of it, I perceived a faint glimmering of light in the direction of the steerage.|4|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Greatly surprised, I endeavored to make my way toward it, as it appeared to be but a few feet from my position.|5|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Scarcely had I moved with this intention, when I lost sight of the glimmer entirely, and, before I could bring it into view again, was obliged to feel along by the box until I had exactly resumed my original situation.|6|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Now, moving my head with caution to and fro, I found that, by proceeding slowly, with great care, in an opposite direction to that in which I had at first started, I was enabled to draw near the light, still keeping it in view.|7|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Presently I came directly upon it (having squeezed my way through innumerable narrow windings), and found that it proceeded from some fragments of my matches lying in an empty barrel turned upon its side.|8|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I was wondering how they came in such a place, when my hand fell upon two or three pieces of taper wax, which had been evidently mumbled by the dog.|9|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I concluded at once that he had devoured the whole of my supply of candles, and I felt hopeless of being ever able to read the note of Augustus.|10|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The small remnants of the wax were so mashed up among other rubbish in the barrel, that I despaired of deriving any service from them, and left them as they were.|11|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The phosphorus, of which there was only a speck or two, I gathered up as well as I could, and returned with it, after much difficulty, to my box, where Tiger had all the while remained.|12|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
What to do next I could not tell.|0|38|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The hold was so intensely dark that I could not see my hand, however close I would hold it to my face.|1|38|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The white slip of paper could barely be discerned, and not even that when I looked at it directly; by turning the exterior portions of the retina toward it–that is to say, by surveying it slightly askance, I found that it became in some measure perceptible.|2|38|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Thus the gloom of my prison may be imagined, and the note of my friend, if indeed it were a note from him, seemed only likely to throw me into further trouble, by disquieting to no purpose my already enfeebled and agitated mind.|3|38|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In vain I revolved in my brain a multitude of absurd expedients for procuring light–such expedients precisely as a man in the perturbed sleep occasioned by opium would be apt to fall upon for a similar purpose–each and all of which appear by turns to the dreamer the most reasonable and the most preposterous of conceptions, just as the reasoning or imaginative faculties flicker, alternately, one above the other.|4|38|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At last an idea occurred to me which seemed rational, and which gave me cause to wonder, very justly, that I had not entertained it before.|5|38|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I placed the slip of paper on the back of a book, and, collecting the fragments of the phosphorus matches which I had brought from the barrel, laid them together upon the paper.|6|38|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I then, with the palm of my hand, rubbed the whole over quickly, yet steadily.|7|38|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A clear light diffused itself immediately throughout the whole surface; and had there been any writing upon it, I should not have experienced the least difficulty, I am sure, in reading it.|8|38|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Not a syllable was there, however–nothing but a dreary and unsatisfactory blank; the illumination died away in a few seconds, and my heart died away within me as it went.|9|38|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I have before stated more than once that my intellect, for some period prior to this, had been in a condition nearly bordering on idiocy.|0|39|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There were, to be sure, momentary intervals of perfect sanity, and, now and then, even of energy; but these were few.|1|39|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It must be remembered that I had been, for many days certainly, inhaling the almost pestilential atmosphere of a close hold in a whaling vessel, and for a long portion of that time but scantily supplied with water.|2|39|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For the last fourteen or fifteen hours I had none–nor had I slept during that time.|3|39|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Salt provisions of the most exciting kind had been my chief, and, indeed, since the loss of the mutton, my only supply of food, with the exception of the sea-biscuit; and these latter were utterly useless to me, as they were too dry and hard to be swallowed in the swollen and parched condition of my throat.|4|39|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I was now in a high state of fever, and in every respect exceedingly ill.|5|39|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This will account for the fact that many miserable hours of despondency elapsed after my last adventure with the phosphorus, before the thought suggested itself that I had examined only one side of the paper.|6|39|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I shall not attempt to describe my feelings of rage (for I believe I was more angry than any thing else) when the egregious oversight I had committed flashed suddenly upon my perception.|7|39|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The blunder itself would have been unimportant, had not my own folly and impetuosity rendered it otherwise–in my disappointment at not finding some words upon the slip, I had childishly torn it in pieces and thrown it away, it was impossible to say where.|8|39|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
From the worst part of this dilemma I was relieved by the sagacity of Tiger.|0|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having got, after a long search, a small piece of the note, I put it to the dog's nose, and endeavored to make him understand that he must bring me the rest of it.|1|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To my astonishment, (for I had taught him none of the usual tricks for which his breed are famous,) he seemed to enter at once into my meaning, and, rummaging about for a few moments, soon found another considerable portion.|2|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Bringing me this, he paused awhile, and, rubbing his nose against my hand, appeared to be waiting for my approval of what he had done.|3|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I patted him on the head, when he immediately made off again.|4|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was now some minutes before he came back–but when he did come, he brought with him a large slip, which proved to be all the paper missing–it having been torn, it seems, only into three pieces.|5|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Luckily, I had no trouble in finding what few fragments of the phosphorus were left- being guided by the indistinct glow one or two of the particles still emitted.|6|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My difficulties had taught me the necessity of caution, and I now took time to reflect upon what I was about to do.|7|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was very probable, I considered, that some words were written upon that side of the paper which had not been examined–but which side was that?|8|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Fitting the pieces together gave me no clew in this respect, although it assured me that the words (if there were any) would be found all on one side, and connected in a proper manner, as written.|9|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There was the greater necessity of ascertaining the point in question beyond a doubt, as the phosphorus remaining would be altogether insufficient for a third attempt, should I fail in the one I was now about to make.|10|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I placed the paper on a book as before, and sat for some minutes thoughtfully revolving the matter over in my mind.|11|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At last I thought it barely possible that the written side might have some unevenness on its surface, which a delicate sense of feeling might enable me to detect.|12|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I determined to make the experiment and passed my finger very carefully over the side which first presented itself.|13|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Nothing, however, was perceptible, and I turned the paper, adjusting it on the book.|14|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I now again carried my forefinger cautiously along, when I was aware of an exceedingly slight, but still discernable glow, which followed as it proceeded.|15|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This, I knew, must arise from some very minute remaining particles of the phosphorus with which I had covered the paper in my previous attempt.|16|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The other, or under side, then, was that on which lay the writing, if writing there should finally prove to be.|17|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Again I turned the note, and went to work as I had previously done.|18|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having rubbed in the phosphorus, a brilliancy ensued as before–but this time several lines of MS.|19|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
in a large hand, and apparently in red ink, became distinctly visible.|20|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The glimmer, although sufficiently bright, was but momentary.|21|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Still, had I not been too greatly excited, there would have been ample time enough for me to peruse the whole three sentences before me–for I saw there were three.|22|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"In my anxiety, however, to read all at once, I succeeded only in reading the seven concluding words, which thus appeared–""blood- your life depends upon lying close""."|23|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Had I been able to ascertain the entire contents of the note-the full meaning of the admonition which my friend had thus attempted to convey, that admonition, even although it should have revealed a story of disaster the most unspeakable, could not, I am firmly convinced, have imbued my mind with one tithe of the harrowing and yet indefinable horror with which I was inspired by the fragmentary warning thus received.|0|41|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"And ""blood,"" too, that word of all words–so rife at all times with mystery, and suffering, and terror–how trebly full of import did it now appear–how chilly and heavily (disjointed, as it thus was, from any foregoing words to qualify or render it distinct) did its vague syllables fall, amid the deep gloom of my prison, into the innermost recesses of my soul!"|1|41|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Augustus had, undoubtedly, good reasons for wishing me to remain concealed, and I formed a thousand surmises as to what they could be–but I could think of nothing affording a satisfactory solution of the mystery.|0|42|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
just after returning from my last journey to the trap, and before my attention had been otherwise directed by the singular conduct of Tiger, I had come to the resolution of making myself heard at all events by those on board, or, if I could not succeed in this directly, of trying to cut my way through the orlop deck.|1|42|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The half certainty which I felt of being able to accomplish one of these two purposes in the last emergency, had given me courage (which I should not otherwise have had) to endure the evils of my situation.|2|42|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The few words I had been able to read, however, had cut me off from these final resources, and I now, for the first time, felt all the misery of my fate.|3|42|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In a paroxysm of despair I threw myself again upon the mattress, where, for about the period of a day and night, I lay in a kind of stupor, relieved only by momentary intervals of reason and recollection.|4|42|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At length I once more arose, and busied myself in reflection upon the horrors which encompassed me.|0|43|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For another twenty-four hours it was barely possible that I might exist without water–for a longer time I could not do so.|1|43|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
During the first portion of my imprisonment I had made free use of the cordials with which Augustus had supplied me, but they only served to excite fever, without in the least degree assuaging thirst.|2|43|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I had now only about a gill left, and this was of a species of strong peach liqueur at which my stomach revolted.|3|43|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The sausages were entirely consumed; of the ham nothing remained but a small piece of the skin; and all the biscuit, except a few fragments of one, had been eaten by Tiger.|4|43|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To add to my troubles, I found that my headache was increasing momentarily, and with it the species of delirium which had distressed me more or less since my first falling asleep.|5|43|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For some hours past it had been with the greatest difficulty I could breathe at all, and now each attempt at so doing was attended with the most depressing spasmodic action of the chest.|6|43|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But there was still another and very different source of disquietude, and one, indeed, whose harassing terrors had been the chief means of arousing me to exertion from my stupor on the mattress.|7|43|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It arose from the demeanor of the dog.|8|43|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I first observed an alteration in his conduct while rubbing in the phosphorus on the paper in my last attempt.|0|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As I rubbed, he ran his nose against my hand with a slight snarl; but I was too greatly excited at the time to pay much attention to the circumstance.|1|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Soon afterward, it will be remembered, I threw myself on the mattress, and fell into a species of lethargy.|2|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Presently I became aware of a singular hissing sound close at my ears, and discovered it to proceed from Tiger, who was panting and wheezing in a state of the greatest apparent excitement, his eyeballs flashing fiercely through the gloom.|3|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I spoke to him, when he replied with a low growl, and then remained quiet.|4|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Presently I relapsed into my stupor, from which I was again awakened in a similar manner.|5|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This was repeated three or four times, until finally his behaviour inspired me with so great a degree of fear, that I became fully aroused.|6|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He was now lying close by the door of the box, snarling fearfully, although in a kind of undertone, and grinding his teeth as if strongly convulsed.|7|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I had no doubt whatever that the want of water or the confined atmosphere of the hold had driven him mad, and I was at a loss what course to pursue.|8|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I could not endure the thought of killing him, yet it seemed absolutely necessary for my own safety.|9|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I could distinctly perceive his eyes fastened upon me with an expression of the most deadly animosity, and I expected every instant that he would attack me.|10|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At last I could endure my terrible situation no longer, and determined to make my way from the box at all hazards, and dispatch him, if his opposition should render it necessary for me to do so.|11|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To get out, I had to pass directly over his body, and he already seemed to anticipate my design–missing himself upon his fore.|12|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
legs (as I perceived by the altered position of his eyes), and displayed the whole of his white fangs, which were easily discernible.|13|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I took the remains of the ham-skin, and the bottle containing the liqueur, and secured them about my person, together with a large carving-knife which Augustus had left me–then, folding my cloak around me as closely as possible, I made a movement toward the mouth of the box.|14|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
No sooner did I do this, than the dog sprang with a loud growl toward my throat.|15|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The whole weight of his body struck me on the right shoulder, and I fell violently to the left, while the enraged animal passed entirely over me.|16|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I had fAllan upon my knees, with my head buried among the blankets, and these protected me from a second furious assault, during which I felt the sharp teeth pressing vigorously upon the woollen which enveloped my neck–yet, luckily, without being able to penetrate all the folds.|17|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I was now beneath the dog, and a few moments would place me completely in his power.|18|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Despair gave me strength, and I rose boldly up, shaking him from me by main force, and dragging with me the blankets from the mattress.|19|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
These I now threw over him, and before he could extricate himself, I had got through the door and closed it effectually against his pursuit.|20|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In this struggle, however, I had been forced to drop the morsel of ham-skin, and I now found my whole stock of provisions reduced to a single gill of liqueur, As this reflection crossed my mind, I felt myself actuated by one of those fits of perverseness which might be supposed to influence a spoiled child in similar circumstances, and, raising the bottle to my lips, I drained it to the last drop, and dashed it furiously upon the floor.|21|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Scarcely had the echo of the crash died away, when I heard my name pronounced in an eager but subdued voice, issuing from the direction of the steerage.|0|45|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
So unexpected was anything of the kind, and so intense was the emotion excited within me by the sound, that I endeavoured in vain to reply.|1|45|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My powers of speech totally failed, and in an agony of terror lest my friend should conclude me dead, and return without attempting to reach me, I stood up between the crates near the door of the box, trembling convulsively, and gasping and struggling for utterance.|2|45|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Had a thousand words depended upon a syllable, I could not have spoken it.|3|45|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There was a slight movement now audible among the lumber somewhere forward of my station.|4|45|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The sound presently grew less distinct, then again less so, and still less.|5|45|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Shall I ever forget my feelings at this moment?|6|45|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He was going- my friend, my companion, from whom I had a right to expect so much- he was going–he would abandon me–he was gone!|7|45|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He would leave me to perish miserably, to expire in the most horrible and loathesome of dungeons–and one word, one little syllable, would save me–yet that single syllable I could not utter!|8|45|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I felt, I am sure, more than ten thousand times the agonies of death itself.|9|45|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My brain reeled, and I fell, deadly sick, against the end of the box.|10|45|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As I fell the carving-knife was shaken out from the waist-band of my pantaloons, and dropped with a rattling sound to the floor.|0|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Never did any strain of the richest melody come so sweetly to my ears!|1|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
With the intensest anxiety I listened to ascertain the effect of the noise upon Augustus–for I knew that the person who called my name could be no one but himself.|2|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
All was silent for some moments.|3|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"At length I again heard the word ""Arthur""!"|4|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
repeated in a low tone, and one full of hesitation.|5|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"Reviving hope loosened at once my powers of speech, and I now screamed at the top of my voice, ""Augustus!"|6|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"oh, Augustus""!"|7|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"""Hush!"|8|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"for God's sake be silent""!"|9|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"he replied, in a voice trembling with agitation; ""I will be with you immediately–as soon as I can make my way through the hold""."|10|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For a long time I heard him moving among the lumber, and every moment seemed to me an age.|11|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At length I felt his hand upon my shoulder, and he placed, at the same moment, a bottle of water to my lips.|12|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Those only who have been suddenly redeemed from the jaws of the tomb, or who have known the insufferable torments of thirst under circumstances as aggravated as those which encompassed me in my dreary prison, can form any idea of the unutterable transports which that one long draught of the richest of all physical luxuries afforded.|13|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When I had in some degree satisfied my thirst, Augustus produced from his pocket three or four boiled potatoes, which I devoured with the greatest avidity.|0|47|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He had brought with him a light in a dark lantern, and the grateful rays afforded me scarcely less comfort than the food and drink.|1|47|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But I was impatient to learn the cause of his protracted absence, and he proceeded to recount what had happened on board during my incarceration.|2|47|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The brig put to sea, as I had supposed, in about an hour after he had left the watch.|0|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This was on the twentieth of June.|1|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It will be remembered that I had then been in the hold for three days; and, during this period, there was so constant a bustle on board, and so much running to and fro, especially in the cabin and staterooms, that he had had no chance of visiting me without the risk of having the secret of the trap discovered.|2|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When at length he did come, I had assured him that I was doing as well as possible; and, therefore, for the two next days be felt but little uneasiness on my account–still, however, watching an opportunity of going down.|3|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was not until the fourth day that he found one.|4|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Several times during this interval he had made up his mind to let his father know of the adventure, and have me come up at once; but we were still within reaching distance of Nantucket, and it was doubtful, from some expressions which had escaped Captain Barnard, whether he would not immediately put back if he discovered me to be on board.|5|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Besides, upon thinking the matter over, Augustus, so he told me, could not imagine that I was in immediate want, or that I would hesitate, in such case, to make myself heard at the trap.|6|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When, therefore, he considered everything he concluded to let me stay until he could meet with an opportunity of visiting me unobserved.|7|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This, as I said before, did not occur until the fourth day after his bringing me the watch, and the seventh since I had first entered the hold.|8|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He then went down without taking with him any water or provisions, intending in the first place merely to call my attention, and get me to come from the box to the trap,–when he would go up to the stateroom and thence hand me down a sup.|9|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
ply.|10|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When he descended for this purpose he found that I was asleep, for it seems that I was snoring very loudly.|11|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
From all the calculations I can make on the subject, this must have been the slumber into which I fell just after my return from the trap with the watch, and which, consequently, must have lasted for more than three entire days and nights at the very least.|12|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Latterly, I have had reason both from my own experience and the assurance of others, to be acquainted with the strong soporific effects of the stench arising from old fish-oil when closely confined; and when I think of the condition of the hold in which I was imprisoned, and the long period during which the brig had been used as a whaling vessel, I am more inclined to wonder that I awoke at all, after once falling asleep, than that I should have slept uninterruptedly for the period specified above.|13|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Augustus called to me at first in a low voice and without closing the trap–but I made him no reply.|0|49|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He then shut the trap, and spoke to me in a louder, and finally in a very loud tone–still I continued to snore.|1|49|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He was now at a loss what to do.|2|49|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It would take him some time to make his way through the lumber to my box, and in the meanwhile his absence would be noticed by Captain Barnard, who had occasion for his services every minute, in arranging and copying papers connected with the business of the voyage.|3|49|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He determined, therefore, upon reflection, to ascend, and await another opportunity of visiting me.|4|49|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He was the more easily induced to this resolve, as my slumber appeared to be of the most tranquil nature, and he could not suppose that I had undergone any inconvenience from my incarceration.|5|49|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He had just made up his mind on these points when his attention was arrested by an unusual bustle, the sound of which proceeded apparently from the cabin.|6|49|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He sprang through the trap as quickly as possible, closed it, and threw open the door of his stateroom.|7|49|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
No sooner had he put his foot over the threshold than a pistol flashed in his face, and he was knocked down, at the same moment, by a blow from a handspike.|8|49|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A strong hand held him on the cabin floor, with a tight grasp upon his throat; still he was able to see what was going on around him.|0|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
His father was tied hand and foot, and lying along the steps of the companion-way, with his head down, and a deep wound in the forehead, from which the blood was flowing in a continued stream.|1|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He spoke not a word, and was apparently dying.|2|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Over him stood the first mate, eyeing him with an expression of fiendish derision, and deliberately searching his pockets, from which he presently drew forth a large wallet and a chronometer.|3|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Seven of the crew (among whom was the cook, a negro) were rummaging the staterooms on the larboard for arms, where they soon equipped themselves with muskets and ammunition.|4|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Besides Augustus and Captain Barnard, there were nine men altogether in the cabin, and these among the most ruffianly of the brig's company.|5|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The villains now went upon deck, taking my friend with them after having secured his arms behind his back.|6|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They proceeded straight to the forecastle, which was fastened down–two of the mutineers standing by it with axes–two also at the main hatch.|7|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"The mate called out in a loud voice: ""Do you hear there below?"|8|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"tumble up with you, one by one–now, mark that–and no grumbling""!"|9|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was some minutes before any one appeared:–at last an Englishman, who had shipped as a raw hand, came up, weeping piteously, and entreating the mate, in the most humble manner, to spare his life.|10|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The only reply was a blow on the forehead from an axe.|11|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The poor fellow fell to the deck without a groan, and the black cook lifted him up in his arms as he would a child, and tossed him deliberately into the sea.|12|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Hearing the blow and the plunge of the body, the men below could now be induced to venture on deck neither by threats nor promises, until a proposition was made to smoke them out.|13|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A general rush then ensued, and for a moment it seemed possible that the brig might be retaken.|14|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The mutineers, however, succeeded at last in closing the forecastle effectually before more than six of their opponents could get up.|15|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
These six, finding themselves so greatly outnumbered and without arms, submitted after a brief struggle.|16|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The mate gave them fair words–no doubt with a view of inducing those below to yield, for they had no difficulty in hearing all that was said on deck.|17|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The result proved his sagacity, no less than his diabolical villainy.|18|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
All in the forecastle presently signified their intention of submitting, and, ascending one by one, were pinioned and then thrown on their backs, together with the first six–there being in all, of the crew who were not concerned in the mutiny, twenty-seven.|19|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A scene of the most horrible butchery ensued.|0|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The bound seamen were dragged to the gangway.|1|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Here the cook stood with an axe, striking each victim on the head as he was forced over the side of the vessel by the other mutineers.|2|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In this manner twenty-two perished, and Augustus had given himself up for lost, expecting every moment his own turn to come next.|3|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But it seemed that the villains were now either weary, or in some measure disgusted with their bloody labour; for the four remaining prisoners, together with my friend, who had been thrown on the deck with the rest, were respited while the mate sent below for rum, and the whole murderous party held a drunken carouse, which lasted until sunset.|4|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They now fell to disputing in regard to the fate of the survivors, who lay not more than four paces off, and could distinguish every word said.|5|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon some of the mutineers the liquor appeared to have a softening effect, for several voices were heard in favor of releasing the captives altogether, on condition of joining the mutiny and sharing the profits.|6|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The black cook, however (who in all respects was a perfect demon, and who seemed to exert as much influence, if not more, than the mate himself), would listen to no proposition of the kind, and rose repeatedly for the purpose of resuming his work at the gangway.|7|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Fortunately he was so far overcome by intoxication as to be easily restrained by the less bloodthirsty of the party, among whom was a line-manager, who went by the name of Dirk Peters.|8|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This man was the son of an Indian squaw of the tribe of Upsarokas, who live among the fastnesses of the Black Hills, near the source of the Missouri.|9|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
His father was a fur-trader, I believe, or at least connected in some manner with the Indian trading-posts on Lewis river.|10|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peter himself was one of the most ferocious-looking men I ever beheld.|11|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He was short in stature, not more than four feet eight inches high, but his limbs were of Herculean mould.|12|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
His hands, especially, were so enormously thick and broad as hardly to retain a human shape.|13|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
His arms, as well as legs, were bowed in the most singular manner, and appeared to possess no flexibility whatever.|14|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
His head was equally deformed, being of immense size, with an indentation on the crown (like that on the head of most negroes), and entirely bald.|15|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To conceal this latter deficiency, which did not proceed from old age, he usually wore a wig formed of any hair-like material which presented itself–occasionally the skin of a Spanish dog or American grizzly bear.|16|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At the time spoken of, he had on a portion of one of these bearskins; and it added no little to the natural ferocity of his countenance, which betook of the Upsaroka character.|17|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The mouth extended nearly from ear to ear, the lips were thin, and seemed, like some other portions of his frame, to be devoid of natural pliancy, so that the ruling expression never varied under the influence of any emotion whatever.|18|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This ruling expression may be conceived when it is considered that the teeth were exceedingly long and protruding, and never even partially covered, in any instance, by the lips.|19|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To pass this man with a casual glance, one might imagine him to be convulsed with laughter, but a second look would induce a shuddering acknowledgment, that if such an expression were indicative of merriment, the merriment must be that of a demon.|20|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Of this singular being many anecdotes were prevalent among the seafaring men of Nantucket.|21|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
These anecdotes went to prove his prodigious strength when under excitement, and some of them had given rise to a doubt of his sanity.|22|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But on board the Grampus, it seems, he was regarded, at the time of the mutiny, with feelings more of derision than of anything else.|23|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I have been thus particular in speaking of Dirk Peters, because, ferocious as he appeared, he proved the main instrument in preserving the life of Augustus, and because I shall have frequent occasion to mention him hereafter in the course of my narrative–a narrative, let me here say, which, in its latter portions, will be found to include incidents of a nature so entirely out of the range of human experience, and for this reason so far beyond the limits of human credulity, that I proceed in utter hopelessness of obtaining credence for all that I shall tell, yet confidently trusting in time and progressing science to verify some of the most important and most improbable of my statements.|24|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
After much indecision and two or three violent quarrels, it was determined at last that all the prisoners (with the exception of Augustus, whom Peters insisted in a jocular manner upon keeping as his clerk) should be set adrift in one of the smallest whaleboats.|0|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The mate went down into the cabin to see if Captain Barnard was still living–for, it will be remembered, he was left below when the mutineers came up.|1|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Presently the two made their appearance, the captain pale as death, but somewhat recovered from the effects of his wound.|2|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He spoke to the men in a voice hardly articulate, entreated them not to set him adrift, but to return to their duty, and promising to land them wherever they chose, and to take no steps for bringing them to justice.|3|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He might as well have spoken to the winds.|4|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Two of the ruffians seized him by the arms and hurled him over the brig's side into the boat, which had been lowered while the mate went below.|5|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The four men who were lying on the deck were then untied and ordered to follow, which they did without attempting any resistance–Augustus being still left in his painful position, although he struggled and prayed only for the poor satisfaction of being permitted to bid his father farewell.|6|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A handful of sea-biscuit and a jug of water were now handed down; but neither mast, sail, oar, nor compass.|7|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The boat was towed astern for a few minutes, during which the mutineers held another consultation–it was then finally cut adrift.|8|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
By this time night had come on–there were neither moon nor stars visible–and a short and ugly sea was running, although there was no great deal of wind.|9|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The boat was instantly out of sight, and little hope could be entertained for the unfortunate sufferers who were in it.|10|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This event happened, however, in latitude 35 degrees 30' north, longitude 61 degrees 20' west, and consequently at no very great distance from the Bermuda Islands.|11|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Augustus therefore endeavored to console himself with the idea that the boat might either succeed in reaching the land, or come sufficiently near to be fAllan in with by vessels off the coast.|12|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
All sail was now put upon the brig, and she continued her original course to the southwest–the mutineers being bent upon some piratical expedition, in which, from all that could be understood, a ship was to be intercepted on her way from the Cape Verd Islands to Porto Rico.|0|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
No attention was paid to Augustus, who was untied and suffered to go about anywhere forward of the cabin companion-way.|1|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Dirk Peters treated him with some degree of kindness, and on one occasion saved him from the brutality of the cook.|2|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
His situation was still one of the most precarious, as the men were continually intoxicated, and there was no relying upon their continued good-humor or carelessness in regard to himself.|3|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
His anxiety on my account be represented, however, as the most distressing result of his condition; and, indeed, I had never reason to doubt the sincerity of his friendship.|4|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
More than once he had resolved to acquaint the mutineers with the secret of my being on board, but was restrained from so doing, partly through recollection of the atrocities he had already beheld, and partly through a hope of being able soon to bring me relief.|5|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For the latter purpose he was constantly on the watch; but, in spite of the most constant vigilance, three days elapsed after the boat was cut adrift before any chance occurred.|6|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At length, on the night of the third day, there came on a heavy blow from the eastward, and all hands were called up to take in sail.|7|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
During the confusion which ensued, he made his way below unobserved, and into the stateroom.|8|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
What was his grief and horror in discovering that the latter had been rendered a place of deposit for a variety of sea-stores and ship-furniture, and that several fathoms of old chain-cable, which had been stowed away beneath the companion-ladder, had been dragged thence to make room for a chest, and were now lying immediately upon the trap!|9|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To remove it without discovery was impossible, and he returned on deck as quickly as he could.|10|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As be came up, the mate seized him by the throat, and demanding what he had been doing in the cabin, was about flinging him over the larboard bulwark, when his life was again preserved through the interference of Dirk Peters.|11|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Augustus was now put in handcuffs (of which there were several pairs on board), and his feet lashed tightly together.|12|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"He was then taken into the steerage, and thrown into a lower berth next to the forecastle bulkheads, with the assurance that he should never put his foot on deck again ""until the brig was no longer a brig""."|13|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This was the expression of the cook, who threw him into the berth–it is hardly possible to say what precise meaning intended by the phrase.|14|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The whole affair, however, proved the ultimate means of my relief, as will presently appear.|15|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For some minutes after the cook had left the forecastle, Augustus abandoned himself to despair, never hoping to leave the berth alive.|0|54|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He now came to the resolution of acquainting the first of the men who should come down with my situation, thinking it better to let me take my chance with the mutineers than perish of thirst in the hold,–for it had been ten days since I was first imprisoned, and my jug of water was not a plentiful supply even for four.|1|54|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As he was thinking on this subject, the idea came all at once into his head that it might be possible to communicate with me by the way of the main hold.|2|54|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In any other circumstances, the difficulty and hazard of the undertaking would have pre.|3|54|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
vented him from attempting it; but now he had, at all events, little prospect of life, and consequently little to lose, he bent his whole mind, therefore, upon the task.|4|54|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
His handcuffs were the first consideration.|0|55|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At first he saw no method of removing them, and feared that he should thus be baffled in the very outset; but upon a closer scrutiny he discovered that the irons could be slipped off and on at pleasure, with very little effort or inconvenience, merely by squeezing his hands through them,–this species of manacle being altogether ineffectual in confining young persons, in whom the smaller bones readily yield to pressure.|1|55|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He now untied his feet, and, leaving the cord in such a manner that it could easily be readjusted in the event of any person's coming down, proceeded to examine the bulkhead where it joined the berth.|2|55|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The partition here was of soft pine board, an inch thick, and he saw that he should have little trouble in cutting his way through.|3|55|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A voice was now heard at the forecastle companion-way, and he had just time to put his right hand into its handcuff (the left had not been removed) and to draw the rope in a slipknot around his ankle, when Dirk Peters came below, followed by Tiger, who immediately leaped into the berth and lay down.|4|55|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The dog had been brought on board by Augustus, who knew my attachment to the animal, and thought it would give me pleasure to have him with me during the voyage.|5|55|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He went up to our house for him immediately after first taking me into the hold, but did not think of mentioning the circumstance upon his bringing the watch.|6|55|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Since the mutiny, Augustus had not seen him before his appearance with Dirk Peters, and had given him up for lost, supposing him to have been thrown overboard by some of the malignant villains belonging to the mate's gang.|7|55|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It appeared afterward that he had crawled into a hole beneath a whale-boat, from which, not having room to turn round, he could not extricate himself.|8|55|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peters at last let him out, and, with a species of good feeling which my friend knew well how to appreciate, had now brought him to him in the forecastle as a companion, leaving at the same time some salt junk and potatoes, with a can of water, he then went on deck, promising to come down with something more to eat on the next day.|9|55|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When he had gone, Augustus freed both hands from the manacles and unfastened his feet.|0|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He then turned down the head of the mattress on which he had been lying, and with his penknife (for the ruffians had not thought it worth while to search him) commenced cutting vigorously across one of the partition planks, as closely as possible to the floor of the berth.|1|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He chose to cut here, because, if suddenly interrupted, he would be able to conceal what had been done by letting the head of the mattress fall into its proper position.|2|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For the remainder of the day, however, no disturbance occurred, and by night he had completely divided the plank.|3|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It should here be observed that none of the crew occupied the forecastle as a sleeping-place, living altogether in the cabin since the mutiny, drinking the wines and feasting on the sea-stores of Captain Barnard, and giving no more heed than was absolutely necessary to the navigation of the brig.|4|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
These circumstances proved fortunate both for myself and Augustus; for, had matters been otherwise, he would have found it impossible to reach me.|5|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As it was, he proceeded with confidence in his design.|6|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was near daybreak, however, before he completed the second division of the board (which was about a foot above the first cut), thus making an aperture quite large enough to admit his passage through with facility to the main orlop deck.|7|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having got here, he made his way with but little trouble to the lower main hatch, although in so doing he had to scramble over tiers of oil-casks piled nearly as high as the upper deck, there being barely room enough left for his body.|8|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon reaching the hatch he found that Tiger had followed him below, squeezing between two rows of the casks.|9|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was now too late, however, to attempt getting to me before dawn, as the chief difficulty lay in passing through the close stowage in the lower hold.|10|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He therefore resolved to return, and wait till the next night.|11|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
With this design, he proceeded to loosen the hatch, so that he might have as little detention as possible when he should come again.|12|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
No sooner had he loosened it than Tiger sprang eagerly to the small opening produced, snuffed for a moment, and then uttered a long whine, scratching at the same time, as if anxious to remove the covering with his paws.|13|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There could be no doubt, from his behaviour, that he was aware of my being in the hold, and Augustus thought it possible that he would be able to get to me if he put him down.|14|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He now hit upon the expedient of sending the note, as it was especially desirable that I should make no attempt at forcing my way out at least under existing circumstances, and there could be no certainty of his getting to me himself on the morrow as he intended.|15|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
After-events proved how fortunate it was that the idea occurred to him as it did; for, had it not been for the receipt of the note, I should undoubtedly have fAllan upon some plan, however desperate, of alarming the crew, and both our lives would most probably have been sacrificed in consequence.|16|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having concluded to write, the difficulty was now to procure the mate.|0|57|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
rials for so doing.|1|57|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
An old toothpick was soon made into a pen; and this by means of feeling altogether, for the between-decks was as dark as pitch.|2|57|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Paper enough was obtained from the back of a letter–a duplicate of the forged letter from Mr. Ross.|3|57|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This had been the original draught; but the handwriting not being sufficiently well imitated, Augustus had written another, thrusting the first, by good fortune, into his coat-pocket, where it was now most opportunely discovered.|4|57|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Ink alone was thus wanting, and a substitute was immediately found for this by means of a slight incision with the pen-knife on the back of a finger just above the nail–a copious flow of blood ensuing, as usual, from wounds in that vicinity.|5|57|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The note was now written, as well as it could be in the dark and under the circumstances.|6|57|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It briefly explained that a mutiny had taken place; that Captain Barnard was set adrift; and that I might expect immediate relief as far as provisions were concerned, but must not venture upon making any disturbance.|7|57|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"It concluded with these words: ""I have scrawled this with blood–your life depends upon lying close""."|8|57|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This slip of paper being tied upon the dog, he was now put down the hatchway, and Augustus made the best of his way back to the forecastle, where be found no reason to believe that any of the crew had been in his absence.|0|58|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To conceal the hole in the partition, he drove his knife in just above it, and hung up a pea-jacket which he found in the berth.|1|58|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
His handcuffs were then replaced, and also the rope around his ankles.|2|58|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
These arrangements were scarcely completed when Dirk Peters came below, very drunk, but in excellent humour, and bringing with him my friend's allowance of provision for the day.|0|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This consisted of a dozen large Irish potatoes roasted, and a pitcher of water.|1|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He sat for some time on a chest by the berth, and talked freely about the mate and the general concerns of the brig.|2|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
His demeanour was exceedingly capricious, and even grotesque.|3|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At one time Augustus was much alarmed by odd conduct.|4|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At last, however, he went on deck, muttering a promise to bring his prisoner a good dinner on the morrow.|5|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
During the day two of the crew (harpooners) came down, accompanied by the cook, all three in nearly the last stage of intoxication.|6|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Like Peters, they made no scruple of talking unreservedly about their plans.|7|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It appeared that they were much divided among themselves as to their ultimate course, agreeing in no point, except the attack on the ship from the Cape Verd Islands, with which they were in hourly expectation of meeting.|8|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As far as could be ascertained, the mutiny had not been brought about altogether for the sake of booty; a private pique of the chief mate's against Captain Barnard having been the main instigation.|9|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There now seemed to be two principal factions among the crew–one headed by the mate, the other by the cook.|10|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The former party were for seizing the first suitable vessel which should present itself, and equipping it at some of the West India Islands for a piratical cruise.|11|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The latter division, however, which was the stronger, and included Dirk Peters among its partisans, were bent upon pursuing the course originally laid out for the brig into the South Pacific; there either to take whale, or act otherwise, as circumstances should suggest.|12|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The representations of Peters, who had frequently visited these regions, had great weight, apparently, with the mutineers, wavering, as they were, between half-engendered notions of profit and pleasure.|13|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He dwelt on the world of novelty and amusement to be found among the innumerable islands of the Pacific, on the perfect security and freedom from all restraint to be enjoyed, but, more particularly, on the deliciousness of the climate, on the abundant means of good living, and on the voluptuous beauty of the women.|14|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As yet, nothing had been absolutely determined upon; but the pictures of the hybrid line-manager were taking strong hold upon the ardent imaginations of the seamen, and there was every possibility that his intentions would be finally carried into effect.|15|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The three men went away in about an hour, and no one else entered the forecastle all day.|0|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Augustus lay quiet until nearly night.|1|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He then freed himself from the rope and irons, and prepared for his attempt.|2|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A bottle was found in one of the berths, and this he filled with water from the pitcher left by Peters, storing his pockets at the same time with cold potatoes.|3|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To his great joy he also came across a lantern, with a small piece of tallow candle in it.|4|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This he could light at any moment, as be had in his possession a box of phosphorus matches.|5|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When it was quite dark, he got through the hole in the bulkhead, having taken the precaution to arrange the bedclothes in the berth so as to convey the idea of a person covered up.|6|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When through, he hung up the pea-jacket on his knife, as before, to conceal the aperture–this manoeuvre being easily effected, as he did not readjust the piece of plank taken out until afterward.|7|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He was now on the main orlop deck, and proceeded to make his way, as before, between the upper deck and the oil-casks to the main hatchway.|8|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having reached this, he lit the piece of candle, and descended, groping with extreme difficulty among the compact stowage of the hold.|9|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In a few moments he became alarmed at the insufferable stench and the closeness of the atmosphere.|10|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He could not think it possible that I had survived my confinement for so long a period breathing so oppressive an air.|11|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He called my name repeatedly, but I made him no reply, and his apprehensions seemed thus to be confirmed.|12|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The brig was rolling violently, and there was so much noise in consequence, that it was useless to listen for any weak sound, such as those of my breathing or snoring.|13|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He threw open the lantern, and held it as high as possible, whenever an opportunity occurred, in order that, by observing the light, I might, if alive, be aware that succor was approaching.|14|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Still nothing was heard from me, and the supposition of my death began to assume the character of certainty.|15|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He determined, nevertheless, to force a passage, if possible, to the box, and at least ascertain beyond a doubt the truth of his surmises.|16|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He pushed on for some time in a most pitiable state of anxiety, until, at length, he found the pathway utterly blocked up, and that there was no possibility of making any farther way by the course in which he had set out.|17|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Overcome now by his feelings, he threw himself among the lumber in despair, and wept like a child.|18|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was at this period that he heard the crash occasioned by the bottle which I had thrown down.|19|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Fortunate, indeed, was it that the incident occurred–for, upon this incident, trivial as it appears, the thread of my destiny depended.|20|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Many years elapsed, however, before I was aware of this fact.|21|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A natural shame and regret for his weakness and indecision prevented Augustus from confiding to me at once what a more intimate and unreserved communion afterward induced him to reveal.|22|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon finding his further progress in the hold impeded by obstacles which he could not overcome, he had resolved to abandon his attempt at reaching me, and return at once to the forecastle.|23|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Before condemning him entirely on this head, the harassing circumstances which embarrassed him should be taken into consideration.|24|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The night was fast wearing away, and his absence from the forecastle might be discovered; and indeed would necessarily be so, if be should fail to get back to the berth by daybreak.|25|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
His candle was expiring in the socket, and there would be the greatest difficulty in retracing his way to the hatchway in the dark.|26|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It must be allowed, too, that he had every good reason to believe me dead; in which event no benefit could result to me from his reaching the box, and a world of danger would be encountered to no purpose by himself.|27|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He had repeatedly called, and I had made him no answer.|28|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I had been now eleven days and nights with no more water than that contained in the jug which he had left with me–a supply which it was not at all probable I had boarded in the beginning of my confinement, as I had every cause to expect a speedy release.|29|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The atmosphere of the hold, too, must have appeared to him, coming from the comparatively open air of the steerage, of a nature absolutely poisonous, and by far more intolerable than it had seemed to me upon my first taking up my quarters in the box–the hatchways at that time having been constantly open for many months previous.|30|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Add to these considerations that of the scene of bloodshed and terror so lately witnessed by my friend; his confinement, privations, and narrow escapes from death, together with the frail and equivocal tenure by which he still existed–circumstances all so well calculated to prostrate every energy of mind–and the reader will be easily brought, as I have been, to regard his apparent falling off in friendship and in faith with sentiments rather of sorrow than of anger.|31|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The crash of the bottle was distinctly heard, yet Augustus was not sure that it proceeded from the hold.|0|61|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The doubt, however, was sufficient inducement to persevere.|1|61|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He clambered up nearly to the orlop deck by means of the stowage, and then, watching for a lull in the pitchings of the vessel, he called out to me in as loud a tone as he could command, regardless, for the moment, of being overheard by the crew.|2|61|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It will be remembered that on this occasion the voice reached me, but I was so entirely overcome by violent agitation as to be incapable of reply.|3|61|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Confident, now, that his worst apprehensions were well founded, be descended, with a view of getting back to the forecastle without loss of time.|4|61|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In his haste some small boxes were thrown down, the noise occasioned by which I heard, as will be recollected.|5|61|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He had made considerable progress on his return when the fall of the knife again caused him to hesitate.|6|61|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He retraced his steps immediately, and, clambering up the stowage a second time, called out my name, loudly as before, having watched for a lull.|7|61|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This time I found voice to answer.|8|61|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Overjoyed at discovering me to be still alive, he now resolved to brave every difficulty and danger in reaching me.|9|61|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having extricated himself as quickly as possible from the labyrinth of lumber by which he was hemmed in, he at length struck into an opening which promised better, and finally, after a series of struggles, arrived at the box in a state of utter exhaustion.|10|61|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The leading particulars of this narration were all that Augustus communicated to me while we remained near the box.|0|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was not until afterward that he entered fully into all the details.|1|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He was apprehensive of being missed, and I was wild with impatience to leave my detested place of confinement.|2|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We resolved to make our way at once to the hole in the bulkhead, near which I was to remain for the present, while he went through to reconnoiter.|3|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To leave Tiger in the box was what neither of us could endure to think of, yet, how to act otherwise was the question.|4|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He now seemed to be perfectly quiet, and we could not even distinguish the sound of his breathing upon applying our ears closely to the box.|5|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I was convinced that he was dead, and determined to open the door.|6|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We found him lying at full length, apparently in a deep stupor, yet still alive.|7|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
No time was to be lost, yet I could not bring myself to abandon an animal who had now been twice instrumental in saving my life, without some attempt at preserving him.|8|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We therefore dragged him along with us as well as we could, although with the greatest difficulty and fatigue; Augustus, during part of the time, being forced to clamber over the impediments in our way with the huge dog in his arms–a feat to which the feebleness of my frame rendered me totally inadequate.|9|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At length we succeeded in reaching the hole, when Augustus got through, and Tiger was pushed in afterward.|10|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
All was found to be safe, and we did not fail to return sincere thanks to God for our deliverance from the imminent danger we had escaped.|11|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For the present, it was agreed that I should remain near the opening, through which my companion could readily supply me with a part of his daily provision, and where I could have the advantages of breathing an atmosphere comparatively pure.|12|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In explanation of some portions of this narrative, wherein I have spoken of the stowage of the brig, and which may appear ambiguous to some of my readers who may have seen a proper or regular stowage, I must here state that the manner in which this most important duty had been per formed on board the Grampus was a most shameful piece of neglect on the part of Captain Barnard, who was by no means as careful or as experienced a seaman as the hazardous nature of the service on which he was employed would seem necessarily to demand.|0|63|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A proper stowage cannot be accomplished in a careless manner, and many most disastrous accidents, even within the limits of my own experience, have arisen from neglect or ignorance in this particular.|1|63|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Coasting vessels, in the frequent hurry and bustle attendant upon taking in or discharging cargo, are the most liable to mishap from the want of a proper attention to stowage.|2|63|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The great point is to allow no possibility of the cargo or ballast shifting position even in the most violent rollings of the vessel.|3|63|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
With this end, great attention must be paid, not only to the bulk taken in, but to the nature of the bulk, and whether there be a full or only a partial cargo.|4|63|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In most kinds of freight the stowage is accomplished by means of a screw.|5|63|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Thus, in a load of tobacco or flour, the whole is screwed so tightly into the hold of the vessel that the barrels or hogsheads, upon discharging, are found to be completely flattened, and take some time to regain their original shape.|6|63|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This screwing, however, is resorted to principally with a view of obtaining more room in the hold; for in a full load of any such commodities as flour or tobacco, there can be no danger of any shifting whatever, at least none from which inconvenience can result.|7|63|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There have been instances, indeed, where this method of screwing has resulted in the most lamentable consequences, arising from a cause altogether distinct from the danger attendant upon a shifting of cargo.|8|63|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A load of cotton, for example, tightly screwed while in certain conditions, has been known, through the expansion of its bulk, to rend a vessel asunder at sea.|9|63|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There can be no doubt either that the same result would ensue in the case of tobacco, while undergoing its usual course of fermentation, were it not for the interstices consequent upon the rotundity of the hogsheads.|10|63|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It is when a partial cargo is received that danger is chiefly to be apprehended from shifting, and that precautions should be always taken to guard against such misfortune.|0|64|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Only those who have encountered a violent gale of wind, or rather who have experienced the rolling of a vessel in a sudden calm after the gale, can form an idea of the tremendous force of the plunges, and of the consequent terrible impetus given to all loose articles in the vessel.|1|64|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It is then that the necessity of a cautious stowage, when there is a partial cargo, becomes obvious.|2|64|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When lying-to (especially with a small bead sail), a vessel which is not properly modelled in the bows is frequently thrown upon her beam-ends; this occurring even every fifteen or twenty minutes upon an average, yet without any serious consequences resulting, provided there be a proper stowage.|3|64|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
If this, however, has not been strictly attended to, in the first of these heavy lurches the whole of the cargo tumbles over to the side of the vessel which lies upon the water, and, being thus prevented from regaining her equilibrium, as she would otherwise necessarily do, she is certain to fill in a few seconds and go down.|4|64|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It is not too much to say that at least one-half of the instances in which vessels have foundered in heavy gales at sea may be attributed to a shifting of cargo or of ballast.|5|64|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When a partial cargo of any kind is taken on board, the whole, after being first stowed as compactly as may be, should be covered with a layer of stout shifting-boards, extending completely across the vessel.|0|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon these boards strong temporary stanchions should be erected, reaching to the timbers above, and thus securing every thing in its place.|1|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In cargoes consisting of grain, or any similar matter, additional precautions are requisite.|2|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A hold filled entirely with grain upon leaving port will be found not more than three fourths full upon reaching its destination–this, too, although the freight, when measured bushel by bushel by the consignee, will overrun by a vast deal (on account of the swelling of the grain) the quantity consigned.|3|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This result is occasioned by settling during the voyage, and is the more perceptible in proportion to the roughness of the weather experienced.|4|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
If grain loosely thrown in a vessel, then, is ever so well secured by shifting-boards and stanchions, it will be liable to shift in a long passage so greatly as to bring about the most distressing calamities.|5|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To prevent these, every method should be employed before leaving port to settle the cargo as much as possible; and for this there are many contrivances, among which may be mentioned the driving of wedges into the grain.|6|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Even after all this is done, and unusual pains taken to secure the shifting-boards, no seaman who knows what he is about will feel altogether secure in a gale of any violence with a cargo of grain on board, and, least of all, with a partial cargo.|7|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Yet there are hundreds of our coasting vessels, and, it is likely, many more from the ports of Europe, which sail daily with partial cargoes, even of the most dangerous species, and without any precaution whatever.|8|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The wonder is that no more accidents occur than do actually happen.|9|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A lamentable instance of this heedlessness occurred to my knowledge in the case of Captain Joel Rice of the schooner Firefly, which sailed from Richmond, Virginia, to Madeira, with a cargo of corn, in the year 1825.|10|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The captain had gone many voyages without serious accident, although he was in the habit of paying no attention whatever to his stowage, more than to secure it in the ordinary manner.|11|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He had never before sailed with a cargo of grain, and on this occasion had the corn thrown on board loosely, when it did not much more than half fill the vessel.|12|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For the first portion of the voyage he met with nothing more than light breezes; but when within a day's sail of Madeira there came on a strong gale from the N. N. E. which forced him to lie-to.|13|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He brought the schooner to the wind under a double-reefed foresail alone, when she rode as well as any vessel could be expected to do, and shipped not a drop of water.|14|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Toward night the gale somewhat abated, and she rolled with more unsteadiness than before, but still did very well, until a heavy lurch threw her upon her beam-ends to starboard.|15|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The corn was then heard to shift bodily, the force of the movement bursting open the main hatchway.|16|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The vessel went down like a shot.|17|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This happened within hail of a small sloop from Madeira, which picked up one of the crew (the only person saved), and which rode out the gale in perfect security, as indeed a jolly boat might have done under proper management.|18|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The stowage on board the Grampus was most clumsily done, if stowage that could be called which was little better than a promiscuous huddling together of oil-casks* and ship furniture.|0|66|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I have already spoken of the condition of articles in the hold.|1|66|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the orlop deck there was space enough for my body (as I have stated) between the oil-casks and the upper deck; a space was left open around the main hatchway; and several other large spaces were left in the stowage.|2|66|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Near the hole cut through the bulkhead by Augustus there was room enough for an entire cask, and in this space I found myself comfortably situated for the present.|3|66|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
* Whaling vessels are usually fitted with iron oil-tanks–why the Grampus was not I have never been able to ascertain.|0|67|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
By the time my friend had got safely into the berth, and readjusted his handcuffs and the rope, it was broad daylight.|0|68|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We had made a narrow escape indeed; for scarcely had he arranged all matters, when the mate came below, with Dirk Peters and the cook.|1|68|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They talked for some time about the vessel from the Cape Verds, and seemed to be excessively anxious for her appearance.|2|68|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At length the cook came to the berth in which Augustus was lying, and seated himself in it near the head.|3|68|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I could see and hear every thing from my hiding-place, for the piece cut out had not been put back, and I was in momentary expectation that the negro would fall against the pea-jacket, which was hung up to conceal the aperture, in which case all would have been discovered, and our lives would, no doubt, have been instantly sacrificed.|4|68|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Our good fortune prevailed, however; and although he frequently touched it as the vessel rolled, he never pressed against it sufficiently to bring about a discovery.|5|68|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The bottom of the jacket had been carefully fastened to the bulkhead, so that the hole might not be seen by its swinging to one side.|6|68|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
All this time Tiger was lying in the foot of the berth, and appeared to have recovered in some measure his faculties, for I could see him occasionally open his eyes and draw a long breath.|7|68|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
After a few minutes the mate and cook went above, leaving Dirk Peters behind, who, as soon as they were gone, came and sat himself down in the place just occupied by the mate.|0|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He began to talk very sociably with Augustus, and we could now see that the greater part of his apparent intoxication, while the two others were with him, was a feint.|1|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He answered all my companion's questions with perfect freedom; told him that he had no doubt of his father's having been picked up, as there were no less than five sail in sight just before sundown on the day he was cut adrift; and used other language of a consolatory nature, which occasioned me no less surprise than pleasure.|2|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Indeed, I began to entertain hopes, that through the instrumentality of Peters we might be finally enabled to regain possession of the brig, and this idea I mentioned to Augustus as soon as I found an opportunity.|3|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He thought the matter possible, but urged the necessity of the greatest caution in making the attempt, as the conduct of the hybrid appeared to be instigated by the most arbitrary caprice alone; and, indeed, it was difficult to say if be was at any moment of sound mind.|4|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peters went upon deck in about an hour, and did not return again until noon, when he brought Augustus a plentiful supply of junk beef and pudding.|5|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Of this, when we were left alone, I partook heartily, without returning through the hole.|6|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
No one else came down into the forecastle during the day, and at night, I got into Augustus' berth, where I slept soundly and sweetly until nearly daybreak, when he awakened me upon hearing a stir upon deck, and I regained my hiding-place as quickly as possible.|7|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When the day was fully broke, we found that Tiger had recovered his strength almost entirely, and gave no indications of hydrophobia, drinking a little water that was offered him with great apparent eagerness.|8|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
During the day he regained all his former vigour and appetite.|9|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
His strange conduct had been brought on, no doubt, by the deleterious quality of the air of the hold, and had no connexion with canine madness.|10|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I could not sufficiently rejoice that I had persisted in bringing him with me from the box.|11|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This day was the thirtieth of June, and the thirteenth since the Grampus made sad from Nantucket.|12|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the second of July the mate came below drunk as usual, and in an excessively good-humor.|0|70|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He came to Augustus's berth, and, giving him a slap on the back, asked him if he thought he could behave himself if he let him loose, and whether he would promise not to be going into the cabin again.|1|70|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To this, of course, my friend answered in the affirmative, when the ruffian set him at liberty, after making him drink from a flask of rum which he drew from his coat-pocket.|2|70|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Both now went on deck, and I did not see Augustus for about three hours.|3|70|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He then came below with the good news that he had obtained permission to go about the brig as be pleased anywhere forward of the mainmast, and that he had been ordered to sleep, as usual, in the forecastle.|4|70|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He brought me, too, a good dinner, and a plentiful supply of water.|5|70|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The brig was still cruising for the vessel from the Cape Verds, and a sail was now in sight, which was thought to be the one in question.|6|70|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As the events of the ensuing eight days were of little importance, and had no direct bearing upon the main incidents of my narrative, I will here throw them into the form of a journal, as I do not wish to omit them altogether.|7|70|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
July 3.|0|71|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–Augustus furnished me with three blankets, with which I contrived a comfortable bed in my hiding-place.|1|71|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
No one came below, except my companion, during the day.|2|71|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Tiger took his station in the berth just by the aperture, and slept heavily, as if not yet entirely recovered from the effects of his sickness.|3|71|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Toward night a flaw of wind struck the brig before sail could be taken in, and very nearly capsized her.|4|71|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The puff died away immediately, however, and no damage was done beyond the splitting of the foretopsail.|5|71|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Dirk Peters treated Augustus all this day with great kindness and entered into a long conversation with him respecting the Pacific Ocean, and the islands he had visited in that region.|6|71|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He asked him whether be would not like to go with the mutineers on a kind of exploring and pleasure voyage in those quarters, and said that the men were gradually coming over to the mate's views.|7|71|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To this Augustus thought it best to reply that he would be glad to go on such an adventure, since nothing better could be done, and that any thing was preferable to a piratical life.|8|71|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
July 4.|0|72|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–The vessel in sight proved to be a small brig from Liverpool, and was allowed to pass unmolested.|1|72|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Augustus spent most of his time on deck, with a view of obtaining all the information in his power respecting the intentions of the mutineers.|2|72|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They had frequent and violent quarrels among themselves, in one of which a harpooner, Jim Bonner, was thrown overboard.|3|72|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The party of the mate was gaining ground.|4|72|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Jim Bonner belonged to the cook's gang, of which Peters was a partisan.|5|72|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
July 5.|0|73|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–About daybreak there came on a stiff breeze from the west, which at noon freshened into a gale, so that the brig could carry nothing more than her trysail and foresail.|1|73|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In taking in the foretopsail, Simms, one of the common hands, and belonging also to the cook's gang, fell overboard, being very much in liquor, and was drowned–no attempt being made to save him.|2|73|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The whole number of persons on board was now thirteen, to wit: Dirk Peters; Seymour, the of the cook's party; the mate, whose name I never learned; Absalom party;–besides Augustus and myself.|3|73|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
July 6.|0|74|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–The gale lasted all this day, blowing in heavy squalls, accompanied with rain.|1|74|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The brig took in a good deal of water through her seams, and one of the pumps was kept continually going, Augustus being forced to take his turn.|2|74|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
just at twilight a large ship passed close by us, without having been discovered until within hail.|3|74|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The ship was supposed to be the one for which the mutineers were on the lookout.|4|74|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The mate hailed her, but the reply was drowned in the roaring of the gale.|5|74|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At eleven, a sea was shipped amidships, which tore away a great portion of the larboard bulwarks, and did some other slight damage.|6|74|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Toward morning the weather moderated, and at sunrise there was very little wind.|7|74|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
July 7.|0|75|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–There was a heavy swell running all this day, during which the brig, being light, rolled excessively, and many articles broke loose in the hold, as I could hear distinctly from my hiding-place.|1|75|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I suffered a great deal from sea-sickness.|2|75|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peters had a long conversation this day with Augustus, and told him that two of his gang, Greely and Allan, had gone over to the mate, and were resolved to turn pirates.|3|75|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He put several questions to Augustus which he did not then exactly understand.|4|75|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
During a part of this evening the leak gained upon the vessel; and little could be done to remedy it, as it was occasioned by the brigs straining, and taking in the water through her seams.|5|75|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A sail was thrummed, and got under the bows, which aided us in some measure, so that we began to gain upon the leak.|6|75|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
July 8.|0|76|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–A light breeze sprang up at sunrise from the eastward, when the mate headed the brig to the southwest, with the intention of making some of the West India islands in pursuance of his piratical designs.|1|76|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
No opposition was made by Peters or the cook–at least none in the hearing of Augustus.|2|76|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
All idea of taking the vessel from the Cape Verds was abandoned.|3|76|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The leak was now easily kept under by one pump going every three quarters of an hour.|4|76|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The sail was drawn from beneath the bows.|5|76|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Spoke two small schooners during the day.|6|76|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
July 9.|0|77|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–Fine weather.|1|77|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
All hands employed in repairing bulwarks.|2|77|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peters had again a long conversation with Augustus, and spoke more plainly than he had done heretofore.|3|77|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He said nothing should induce him to come into the mate's views, and even hinted his intention of taking the brig out of his hands.|4|77|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"He asked my friend if he could depend upon his aid in such case, to which Augustus said, ""Yes,"" without hesitation."|5|77|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peters then said he would sound the others of his party upon the subject, and went away.|6|77|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
During the remainder of the day Augustus had no opportunity of speaking with him privately.|7|77|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
July 10.|0|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–Spoke a brig from Rio, bound to Norfolk.|1|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Weather hazy, with a light baffling wind from the eastward.|2|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To-day Hartman Rogers died, having been attacked on the eighth with spasms after drinking a glass of grog.|3|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This man was of the cook's party, and one upon whom Peters placed his main reliance.|4|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He told Augustus that he believed the mate had poisoned him, and that he expected, if he did not be on the look-out, his own turn would come shortly.|5|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There were now only himself, Jones, and the cook belonging to his own gang–on the other side there were five.|6|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He had spoken to Jones about taking the command from the mate; but the project having been coolly received, he had been deterred from pressing the matter any further, or from saying any thing to the cook.|7|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was well, as it happened, that he was so prudent, for in the afternoon the cook expressed his determination of siding with the mate, and went over formally to that party; while Jones took an opportunity of quarrelling with Peters, and hinted that he would let the mate know of the plan in agitation.|8|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There was now, evidently, no time to be lost, and Peters expressed his determination of attempting to take the vessel at all hazards, provided Augustus would lend him his aid.|9|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My friend at once assured him of his willingness to enter into any plan for that purpose, and, thinking the opportunity a favourable one, made known the fact of my being on board.|10|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At this the hybrid was not more astonished than delighted, as he had no reliance whatever upon Jones, whom he already considered as belonging to the party of the mate.|11|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They went below immediately, when Augustus called to me by name, and Peters and myself were soon made acquainted.|12|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was agreed that we should attempt to retake the vessel upon the first good opportunity, leaving Jones altogether out of our councils.|13|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In the event of success, we were to run the brig into the first port that offered, and deliver her up.|14|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The desertion of his party had frustrated Peters' design of going into the Pacific–an adventure which could not be accomplished without a crew, and he depended upon either getting acquitted upon trial, on the score of insanity (which he solemnly avowed had actuated him in lending his aid to the mutiny), or upon obtaining a pardon, if found guilty, through the representations of Augustus and myself.|15|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"Our deliberations were interrupted for the present by the cry of, ""All hands take in sail,"" and Peters and Augustus ran up on deck."|16|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As usual, the crew were nearly all drunk; and, before sail could be properly taken in, a violent squall laid the brig on her beam-ends.|0|79|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
By keeping her away, however, she righted, having shipped a good deal of water.|1|79|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Scarcely was everything secure, when another squall took the vessel, and immediately afterward another–no damage being done.|2|79|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There was every appearance of a gale of wind, which, indeed, shortly came on, with great fury, from the northward and westward.|3|79|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
All was made as snug as possible, and we laid-to, as usual, under a close-reefed foresail.|4|79|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As night drew on, the wind increased in violence, with a remarkably heavy sea.|5|79|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peters now came into the forecastle with Augustus, and we resumed our deliberations.|6|79|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We agreed that no opportunity could be more favourable than the present for carrying our designs into effect, as an attempt at such a moment would never be anticipated.|0|80|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As the brig was snugly laid-to, there would be no necessity of manoeuvring her until good weather, when, if we succeeded in our attempt, we might liberate one, or perhaps two of the men, to aid us in taking her into port.|1|80|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The main difficulty was the great disproportion in our forces.|2|80|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There were only three of us, and in the cabin there were nine.|3|80|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
All the arms on board, too, were in their possession, with the exception of a pair of small pistols which Peters had concealed about his person, and the large seaman's knife which he always wore in the waistband of his pantaloons.|4|80|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
From certain indications, too–such, for example, as there being no such thing as an axe or a handspike lying in their customary places–we began to fear that the mate had his suspicions, at least in regard to Peters, and that he would let slip no opportunity of getting rid of him.|5|80|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was clear, indeed, that what we should determine to do could not be done too soon.|6|80|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Still the odds were too much against us to allow of our proceeding without the greatest caution.|7|80|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peters proposed that he should go up on deck, and enter into conversation with the watch (Allan), when he would be able to throw him into the sea without trouble, and without making any disturbance, by seizing a good opportunity, that Augustus and myself should then come up, and endeavour to provide ourselves with some kind of weapons from the deck, and that we should then make a rush together, and secure the companion-way before any opposition could be offered.|0|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I objected to this, because I could not believe that the mate (who was a cunning fellow in all matters which did not affect his superstitious prejudices) would suffer himself to be so easily entrapped.|1|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The very fact of there being a watch on deck at all was sufficient proof that he was upon the alert,–it not being usual except in vessels where discipline is most rigidly enforced, to station a watch on deck when a vessel is lying-to in a gale of wind.|2|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As I address myself principally, if not altogether, to persons who have never been to sea, it may be as well to state the exact condition of a vessel under such circumstances.|3|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"Lying-to, or, in sea-parlance, ""laying-to,"" is a measure resorted to for various purposes, and effected in various manners."|4|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In moderate weather it is frequently done with a view of merely bringing the vessel to a stand-still, to wait for another vessel or any similar object.|5|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
If the vessel which lies-to is under full sail, the manoeuvre is usually accomplished by throwing round some portion of her sails, so as to let the wind take them aback, when she becomes stationary.|6|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But we are now speaking of lying-to in a gale of wind.|7|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This is done when the wind is ahead, and too violent to admit of carrying sail without danger of capsizing; and sometimes even when the wind is fair, but the sea too heavy for the vessel to be put before it.|8|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
If a vessel be suffered to scud before the wind in a very heavy sea, much damage is usually done her by the shipping of water over her stern, and sometimes by the violent plunges she makes forward.|9|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This manoeuvre, then, is seldom resorted to in such case, unless through necessity.|10|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When the vessel is in a leaky condition she is often put before the wind even in the heaviest seas; for, when lying-to, her seams are sure to be greatly opened by her violent straining, and it is not so much the case when scudding.|11|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Often, too, it becomes necessary to scud a vessel, either when the blast is so exceedingly furious as to tear in pieces the sail which is employed with a view of bringing her head to the wind, or when, through the false modelling of the frame or other causes, this main object cannot be effected.|12|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Vessels in a gale of wind are laid-to in different manners, according to their peculiar construction.|0|82|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Some lie-to best under a foresail, and this, I believe, is the sail most usually employed.|1|82|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Large square-rigged vessels have sails for the express purpose, called storm-staysails.|2|82|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But the jib is occasionally employed by itself,- sometimes the jib and foresail, or a double-reefed foresail, and not unfrequently the after-sails, are made use of.|3|82|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Foretopsails are very often found to answer the purpose better than any other species of sail.|4|82|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The Grampus was generally laid-to under a close-reefed foresail.|5|82|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When a vessel is to be laid-to, her head is brought up to the wind just so nearly as to fill the sail under which she lies when hauled flat aft, that is, when brought diagonally across the vessel.|0|83|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This being done, the bows point within a few degrees of the direction from which the wind issues, and the windward bow of course receives the shock of the waves.|1|83|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In this situation a good vessel will ride out a very heavy gale of wind without shipping a drop of water, and without any further attention being requisite on the part of the crew.|2|83|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The helm is usually lashed down, but this is altogether unnecessary (except on account of the noise it makes when loose), for the rudder has no effect upon the vessel when lying-to.|3|83|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Indeed, the helm had far better be left loose than lashed very fast, for the rudder is apt to be torn off by heavy seas if there be no room for the helm to play.|4|83|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As long as the sail holds, a well modelled vessel will maintain her situation, and ride every sea, as if instinct with life and reason.|5|83|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
If the violence of the wind, however, should tear the sail into pieces (a feat which it requires a perfect hurricane to accomplish under ordinary circumstances), there is then imminent danger.|6|83|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The vessel falls off from the wind, and, coming broadside to the sea, is completely at its mercy: the only resource in this case is to put her quietly before the wind, letting her scud until some other sail can be set.|7|83|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Some vessels will lie-to under no sail whatever, but such are not to be trusted at sea.|8|83|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But to return from this digression.|0|84|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It had never been customary with the mate to have any watch on deck when lying-to in a gale of wind, and the fact that he had now one, coupled with the circumstance of the missing axes and handspikes, fully convinced us that the crew were too well on the watch to be taken by surprise in the manner Peters had suggested.|1|84|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Something, however, was to be done, and that with as little delay as practicable, for there could be no doubt that a suspicion having been once entertained against Peters, he would be sacrificed upon the earliest occasion, and one would certainly be either found or made upon the breaking of the gale.|2|84|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Augustus now suggested that if Peters could contrive to remove, under any pretext, the piece of chain-cable which lay over the trap in the stateroom, we might possibly be able to come upon them unawares by means of the hold; but a little reflection convinced us that the vessel rolled and pitched too violently for any attempt of that nature.|0|85|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
By good fortune I at length hit upon the idea of working upon the superstitious terrors and guilty conscience of the mate.|0|86|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It will be remembered that one of the crew, Hartman Rogers, had died during the morning, having been attacked two days before with spasms after drinking some spirits and water.|1|86|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peters had expressed to us his opinion that this man had been poisoned by the mate, and for this belief he had reasons, so he said, which were incontrovertible, but which he could not be pre.|2|86|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
vailed upon to explain to us–this wayward refusal being only in keeping with other points of his singular character.|3|86|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But whether or not he had any better grounds for suspecting the mate than we had ourselves, we were easily led to fall in with his suspicion, and determined to act accordingly.|4|86|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Rogers had died about eleven in the forenoon, in violent convulsions; and the corpse presented in a few minutes after death one of the most horrid and loathsome spectacles I ever remember to have seen.|0|87|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The stomach was swollen immensely, like that of a man who has been drowned and lain under water for many weeks.|1|87|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The hands were in the same condition, while the face was shrunken, shrivelled, and of a chalky whiteness, except where relieved by two or three glaring red blotches like those occasioned by the erysipelas: one of these blotches extended diagonally across the face, completely covering up an eye as if with a band of red velvet.|2|87|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In this disgusting condition the body had been brought up from the cabin at noon to be thrown overboard, when the mate getting a glimpse of it (for he now saw it for the first time), and being either touched with remorse for his crime or struck with terror at so horrible a sight, ordered the men to sew the body up in its hammock, and allow it the usual rites of sea-burial.|3|87|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having given these directions, he went below, as if to avoid any further sight of his victim.|4|87|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
While preparations were making to obey his orders, the gale came on with great fury, and the design was abandoned for the present.|5|87|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The corpse, left to itself, was washed into the larboard scuppers, where it still lay at the time of which I speak, floundering about with the furious lurches of the brig.|6|87|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having arranged our plan, we set about putting it in execution as speedily as possible.|0|88|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peters went upon deck, and, as he had anticipated, was immediately accosted by Allan, who appeared to be stationed more as a watch upon the forecastle than for any other purpose.|1|88|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The fate of this villain, however, was speedily and silently decided; for Peters, approaching him in a careless manner, as if about to address him, seized him by the throat, and, before he could utter a single cry, tossed him over the bulwarks.|2|88|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He then called to us, and we came up.|3|88|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Our first precaution was to look about for something with which to arm ourselves, and in doing this we had to proceed with great care, for it was impossible to stand on deck an instant without holding fast, and violent seas broke over the vessel at every plunge forward.|4|88|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was indispensable, too, that we should be quick in our operations, for every minute we expected the mate to be up to set the pumps going, as it was evident the brig must be taking in water very fast.|5|88|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
After searching about for some time, we could find nothing more fit for our purpose than the two pump-handles, one of which Augustus took, and I the other.|6|88|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having secured these, we stripped off the shirt of the corpse and dropped the body overboard.|7|88|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peters and myself then went below, leaving Augustus to watch upon deck, where he took his station just where Allan had been placed, and with his back to the cabin companionway, so that, if any of the mates gang should come up, he might suppose it was the watch.|8|88|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As soon as I got below I commenced disguising myself so as to represent the corpse of Rogers.|0|89|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The shirt which we had taken from the body aided us very much, for it was of singular form and character, and easily recognizable–a kind of smock, which the deceased wore over his other clothing.|1|89|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was a blue stockinett, with large white stripes running across.|2|89|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having put this on, I proceeded to equip myself with a false stomach, in imitation of the horrible deformity of the swollen corpse.|3|89|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This was soon effected by means of stuffing with some bedclothes.|4|89|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I then gave the same appearance to my hands by drawing on a pair of white woollen mittens, and filling them in with any kind of rags that offered themselves.|5|89|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peters then arranged my face, first rubbing it well over with white chalk, and afterward blotching it with blood, which he took from a cut in his finger.|6|89|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The streak across the eye was not forgotten and presented a most shocking appearance.|7|89|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As I viewed myself in a fragment of looking-glass which hung up in the cabin, and by the dim light of a kind of battle-lantern, I was so impressed with a sense of vague awe at my appearance, and at the recollection of the terrific reality which I was thus representing, that I was seized with a violent tremour, and could scarcely summon resolution to go on with my part.|0|90|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was necessary, however, to act with decision, and Peters and myself went upon deck.|1|90|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We there found everything safe, and, keeping close to the bulwarks, the three of us crept to the cabin companion-way.|0|91|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was only partially closed, precautions having been taken to prevent its being suddenly pushed to from without, by means of placing billets of wood on the upper step so as to interfere with the shutting.|1|91|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We found no difficulty in getting a full view of the interior of the cabin through the cracks where the hinges were placed.|2|91|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It now proved to have been very fortunate for us that we had not attempted to take them by surprise, for they were evidently on the alert.|3|91|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Only one was asleep, and he lying just at the foot of the companion-ladder, with a musket by his side.|4|91|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The rest were seated on several mattresses, which had been taken from the berths and thrown on the floor.|5|91|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They were engaged in earnest conversation; and although they had been carousing, as appeared from two empty jugs, with some tin tumblers which lay about, they were not as much intoxicated as usual.|6|91|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
All had knives, one or two of them pistols, and a great many muskets were lying in a berth close at hand.|7|91|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We listened to their conversation for some time before we could make up our minds how to act, having as yet resolved on nothing determinate, except that we would attempt to paralyze their exertions, when we should attack them, by means of the apparition of Rogers.|0|92|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They were discussing their piratical plans, in which all we could hear distinctly was, that they would unite with the crew of a schooner Hornet, and, if possible, get the schooner herself into their possession preparatory to some attempt on a large scale, the particulars of which could not be made out by either of us.|1|92|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"One of the men spoke of Peters, when the mate replied to him in a low voice which could not be distinguished, and afterward added more loudly, that ""he could not understand his being so much forward with the captain's brat in the forecastle, and he thought the sooner both of them were overboard the better""."|0|93|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To this no answer was made, but we could easily perceive that the hint was well received by the whole party, and more particularly by Jones.|1|93|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At this period I was excessively agitated, the more so as I could see that neither Augustus nor Peters could determine how to act.|2|93|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I made up my mind, however, to sell my life as dearly as possible, and not to suffer myself to be overcome by any feelings of trepidation.|3|93|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The tremendous noise made by the roaring of the wind in the rigging, and the washing of the sea over the deck, prevented us from hearing what was said, except during momentary lulls.|0|94|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"In one of these, we all distinctly heard the mate tell one of the men to ""go forward, have an eye upon them, for he wanted no such secret doings on board the brig""."|1|94|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was well for us that the pitching of the vessel at this moment was so violent as to prevent this order from being carried into instant execution.|2|94|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The cook got up from his mattress to go for us, when a tremendous lurch, which I thought would carry away the masts, threw him headlong against one of the larboard stateroom doors, bursting it open, and creating a good deal of other confusion.|3|94|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Luckily, neither of our party was thrown from his position, and we had time to make a precipitate retreat to the forecastle, and arrange a hurried plan of action before the messenger made his appearance, or rather before he put his head out of the companion-hatch, for he did not come on deck.|4|94|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
From this station he could not notice the absence of Allan, and he accordingly bawled out, as if to him, repeating the orders of the mate.|5|94|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"Peters cried out, ""Ay, ay,"" in a disguised voice, and the cook immediately went below, without entertaining a suspicion that all was not right."|6|94|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My two companions now proceeded boldly aft and down into the cabin, Peters closing the door after him in the same manner he had found it.|0|95|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The mate received them with feigned cordiality, and told Augustus that, since he had behaved himself so well of late, he might take up his quarters in the cabin and be one of them for the future.|1|95|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He then poured him out a tumbler half full of rum, and made him drink it.|2|95|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
All this I saw and heard, for I followed my friends to the cabin as soon as the door was shut, and took up my old point of observation.|3|95|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I had brought with me the two pump-handles, one of which I secured near the companion-way, to be ready for use when required.|4|95|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I now steadied myself as well as possible so as to have a good view of all that was passing within, and endeavoured to nerve myself to the task of descending among the mutineers when Peters should make a signal to me, as agreed upon.|0|96|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Presently he contrived to turn the conversation upon the bloody deeds of the mutiny, and by degrees led the men to talk of the thousand superstitions which are so universally current among seamen.|1|96|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I could not make out all that was said, but I could plainly see the effects of the conversation in the countenances of those present.|2|96|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The mate was evidently much agitated, and presently, when some one mentioned the terrific appearance of Rogers' corpse, I thought he was upon the point of swooning.|3|96|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peters now asked him if he did not think it would be better to have the body thrown overboard at once as it was too horrible a sight to see it floundering about in the scuppers.|4|96|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At this the villain absolutely gasped for breath, and turned his head slowly round upon his companions, as if imploring some one to go up and perform the task.|5|96|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
No one, however, stirred, and it was quite evident that the whole party were wound up to the highest pitch of nervous excitement.|6|96|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peters now made me the signal.|7|96|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I immediately threw open the door of the companion-way, and, descending, without uttering a syllable, stood erect in the midst of the party.|8|96|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The intense effect produced by this sudden apparition is not at all to be wondered at when the various circumstances are taken into consideration.|0|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Usually, in cases of a similar nature, there is left in the mind of the spectator some glimmering of doubt as to the reality of the vision before his eyes; a degree of hope, however feeble, that he is the victim of chicanery, and that the apparition is not actually a visitant from the old world of shadows.|1|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It is not too much to say that such remnants of doubt have been at the bottom of almost every such visitation, and that the appalling horror which has sometimes been brought about, is to be attributed, even in the cases most in point, and where most suffering has been experienced, more to a kind of anticipative horror, lest the apparition might possibly be real, than to an unwavering belief in its reality.|2|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But, in the present instance, it will be seen immediately, that in the minds of the mutineers there was not even the shadow of a basis upon which to rest a doubt that the apparition of Rogers was indeed a revivification of his disgusting corpse, or at least its spiritual image.|3|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The isolated situation of the brig, with its entire inaccessibility on account of the gale, confined the apparently possible means of deception within such narrow and definite limits, that they must have thought themselves enabled to survey them all at a glance.|4|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They had now been at sea twenty-four days, without holding more than a speaking communication with any vessel whatever.|5|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The whole of the crew, too–at least all whom they had the most remote reason for suspecting to be on board–were assembled in the cabin, with the exception of Allan, the watch; and his gigantic stature (be was six feet six inches high) was too familiar in their eyes to permit the notion that he was the apparition before them to enter their minds even for an instant.|6|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Add to these considerations the awe-inspiring nature of the tempest, and that of the conversation brought about by Peters; the deep impression which the loathsomeness of the actual corpse had made in the morning upon the imaginations of the men; the excellence of the imitation in my person, and the uncertain and wavering light in which they beheld me, as the glare of the cabin lantern, swinging violently to and fro, fell dubiously and fitfully upon my figure, and there will be no reason to wonder that the deception had even more than the entire effect which we had anticipated.|7|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The mate sprang up from the mattress on which he was lying, and, without uttering a syllable, fell back, stone dead, upon the cabin floor, and was hurled to the leeward like a log by a heavy roll of the brig.|8|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Of the remaining seven, there were but three who had at first any degree of presence of mind.|9|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The four others sat for some time rooted apparently to the floor, the most pitiable objects of horror and utter despair my eyes ever encountered.|10|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The only opposition we experienced at all was from the cook, John Hunt, and Richard Parker; but they made but a feeble and irresolute defence.|11|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The two former were shot instantly by Peters, and I felled Parker with a blow on the head from the pump-handle which I had brought with me.|12|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In the meantime, Augustus seized one of the muskets lying on the floor now but three remaining; but by this time they had become aroused from their lethargy, and perhaps began to see that a deception had been practised upon them, for they fought with great resolution and fury, and, but for the immense muscular strength of Peters, might have the floor, stabbed him in several places along the right arm, and would no doubt have soon dispatched him (as neither Peters nor myself could immediately get rid of our own antagonists) had it not been for the timely aid of a friend, upon whose assistance we, surely, had never depended.|13|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This friend was no other than Tiger.|14|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
With a low growl, he bounded into the cabin, at a most critical moment for Augustus, and throwing himself upon Jones, pinned him to the floor in an instant.|15|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My friend, however, was now too much injured to render us any aid whatever, and I was so encumbered with my disguise that I could do but little.|16|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The dog would not leave his hold upon the throat of Jones–Peters, nevertheless, was far more than a match for the two men who remained, and would, no doubt, have dispatched them sooner, had it not been for the narrow space in which he had to act, and the tremendous lurches of the vessel.|17|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Presently he was enabled to get hold of a heavy stool, several of which lay about the floor.|18|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
With this he beat out the brains of Greely as he was in the act of discharging a musket at me, and immediately afterward a roll of the brig throwing him in contact with Hicks, he seized him by the throat, and, by dint of sheer strength, strangled him instantaneously.|19|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Thus, in far less time than I have taken to tell it, we found ourselves masters of the brig.|20|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The only person of our opponents who was left alive was Richard Parker.|0|98|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This man, it will be remembered, I had knocked down with a blow from the pump-handle at the commencement of the attack.|1|98|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He now lay motionless by the door of the shattered stateroom; but, upon Peters touching him with his foot, he spoke, and entreated for mercy.|2|98|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
His head was only slightly cut, and otherwise he had received no injury, having been merely stunned by the blow.|3|98|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He now got up, and, for the present, we secured his hands behind his back.|4|98|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The dog was still growling over Jones; but, upon examination, we found him completely dead, the blood issuing in a stream from a deep wound in the throat, inflicted, no doubt, by the sharp teeth of the animal.|5|98|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was now about one o'clock in the morning, and the wind was still blowing tremendously.|0|99|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The brig evidently laboured much more than usual, and it became absolutely necessary that something should be done with a view of easing her in some measure.|1|99|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At almost every roll to leeward she shipped a sea, several of which came partially down into the cabin during our scuffle, the hatchway having been left open by myself when I descended.|2|99|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The entire range of bulwarks to larboard had been swept away, as well as the caboose, together with the jollyboat from the counter.|3|99|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The creaking and working of the mainmast, too, gave indication that it was nearly sprung.|4|99|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To make room for more stowage in the afterhold, the heel of this mast had been stepped between decks (a very reprehensible practice, occasionally resorted to by ignorant ship-builders), so that it was in imminent danger of working from its step.|5|99|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But, to crown all our difficulties, we plummed the well, and found no less than seven feet of water.|6|99|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Leaving the bodies of the crew lying in the cabin, we got to work immediately at the pumps–Parker, of course, being set at liberty to assist us in the labour.|0|100|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Augustus's arm was bound up as well as we could effect it, and he did what he could, but that was not much.|1|100|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
However, we found that we could just manage to keep the leak from gaining upon us by having one pump constantly going.|2|100|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As there were only four of us, this was severe labour; but we endeavoured to keep up our spirits, and looked anxiously for daybreak, when we hoped to lighten the brig by cutting away the mainmast.|3|100|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In this manner we passed a night of terrible anxiety and fatigue, and, when the day at length broke, the gale had neither abated in the least, nor were there any signs of its abating.|0|101|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We now dragged the bodies on deck and threw them overboard.|1|101|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Our next care was to get rid of the mainmast.|2|101|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The necessary preparations having been made, Peters cut away at the mast (having found axes in the cabin), while the rest of us stood by the stays and lanyards.|3|101|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As the brig gave a tremendous lee-lurch, the word was given to cut away the weather-lanyards, which being done, the whole mass of wood and rigging plunged into the sea, clear of the brig, and without doing any material injury.|4|101|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We now found that the vessel did not labour quite as much as before, but our situation was still exceedingly precarious, and in spite of the utmost exertions, we could not gain upon the leak without the aid of both pumps.|5|101|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The little assistance which Augustus could render us was not really of any importance.|6|101|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To add to our distress, a heavy sea, striking the brig to the windward, threw her off several points from the wind, and, before she could regain her position, another broke completely over her, and hurled her full upon her beam-ends.|7|101|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The ballast now shifted in a mass to leeward (the stowage had been knocking about perfectly at random for some time), and for a few moments we thought nothing could save us from capsizing.|8|101|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Presently, however, we partially righted; but the ballast still retaining its place to larboard, we lay so much along that it was useless to think of working the pumps, which indeed we could not have done much longer in any case, as our hands were entirely raw with the excessive labour we had undergone, and were bleeding in the most horrible manner.|9|101|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Contrary to Parker's advice, we now proceeded to cut away the foremast, and at length accomplished it after much difficulty, owing to the position in which we lay.|0|102|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In going overboard the wreck took with it the bowsprit, and left us a complete hulk.|1|102|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
So far we had had reason to rejoice in the escape of our longboat, which had received no damage from any of the huge seas which had come on board.|0|103|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But we had not long to congratulate ourselves; for the foremast having gone, and, of course, the foresail with it, by which the brig had been steadied, every sea now made a complete breach over us, and in five minutes our deck was swept from stern to stern, the longboat and starboard bulwarks torn off, and even the windlass shattered into fragments.|1|103|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was, indeed, hardly possible for us to be in a more pitiable condition.|2|103|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At noon there seemed to be some slight appearance of the gale's abating, but in this we were sadly disappointed, for it only lulled for a few minutes to blow with redoubled fury.|0|104|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
About four in the afternoon it was utterly impossible to stand up against the violence of the blast; and, as the night closed in upon us, I had not a shadow of hope that the vessel would hold together until morning.|1|104|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
By midnight we had settled very deep in the water, which was now up to the orlop deck.|0|105|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The rudder went soon afterward, the sea which tore it away lifting the after portion of the brig entirely from the water, against which she thumped in her descent with such a concussion as would be occasioned by going ashore.|1|105|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We had all calculated that the rudder would hold its own to the last, as it was unusually strong, being rigged as I have never seen one rigged either before or since.|2|105|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Down its main timber there ran a succession of stout iron hooks, and others in the same manner down the stern-post.|3|105|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Through these hooks there extended a very thick wrought-iron rod, the rudder being thus held to the stern-post and swinging freely on the rod.|4|105|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The tremendous force of the sea which tore it off may be estimated by the fact, that the hooks in the stern-post, which ran entirely through it, being clinched on the inside, were drawn every one of them completely out of the solid wood.|5|105|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We had scarcely time to draw breath after the violence of this shock, when one of the most tremendous waves I had then ever known broke right on board of us, sweeping the companion-way clear off, bursting in the hatchways, and firing every inch of the vessel with water.|0|106|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Luckily, just before night, all four of us had lashed ourselves firmly to the fragments of the windlass, lying in this manner as flat upon the deck as possible.|0|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This precaution alone saved us from destruction.|1|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As it was, we were all more or less stunned by the immense weight of water which tumbled upon us, and which did not roll from above us until we were nearly exhausted.|2|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As soon as I could recover breath, I called aloud to my companions.|3|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"Augustus alone replied, saying: ""It is all over with us, and may God have mercy upon our souls""!"|4|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
By-and-by both the others were enabled to speak, when they exhorted us to take courage, as there was still hope; it being impossible, from the nature of the cargo, that the brig could go down, and there being every chance that the gale would blow over by the morning.|5|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
These words inspired me with new life; for, strange as it may seem, although it was obvious that a vessel with a cargo of empty oil-casks would not sink, I had been hitherto so confused in mind as to have overlooked this consideration altogether; and the danger which I had for some time regarded as the most imminent was that of foundering.|6|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As hope revived within me, I made use of every opportunity to strengthen the lashings which held me to the remains of the windlass, and in this occupation I soon discovered that my companions were also busy.|7|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The night was as dark as it could possibly be, and the horrible shrieking din and confusion which surrounded us it is useless to attempt describing.|8|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Our deck lay level with the sea, or rather we were encircled with a towering ridge of foam, a portion of which swept over us even instant.|9|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It is not too much to say that our heads were not fairly out of the water more than one second in three.|10|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Although we lay close together, no one of us could see the other, or, indeed, any portion of the brig itself, upon which we were so tempestuously hurled about.|11|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At intervals we called one to the other, thus endeavouring to keep alive hope, and render consolation and encouragement to such of us as stood most in need of it.|12|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The feeble condition of Augustus made him an object of solicitude with us all; and as, from the lacerated condition of his right arm, it must have been impossible for him to secure his lashings with any degree of firmness, we were in momentary expectation of finding that he had gone overboard–yet to render him aid was a thing altogether out of the question.|13|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Fortunately, his station was more secure than that of any of the rest of us; for the upper part of his body lying just beneath a portion of the shattered windlass, the seas, as they tumbled in upon him, were greatly broken in their violence.|14|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In any other situation than this (into which he had been accidentally thrown after having lashed himself in a very exposed spot) he must inevitably have perished before morning.|15|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Owing to the brig's lying so much along, we were all less liable to be washed off than otherwise would have been the case.|16|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The heel, as I have before stated, was to larboard, about one half of the deck being constantly under water.|17|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The seas, therefore, which struck us to starboard were much broken, by the vessel's side, only reaching us in fragments as we lay flat on our faces; while those which came from larboard being what are called back-water seas, and obtaining little hold upon us on account of our posture, had not sufficient force to drag us from our fastenings.|18|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In this frightful situation we lay until the day broke so as to show us more fully the horrors which surrounded us.|0|108|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The brig was a mere log, rolling about at the mercy of every wave; the gale was upon the increase, if any thing, blowing indeed a complete hurricane, and there appeared to us no earthly prospect of deliverance.|1|108|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For several hours we held on in silence, expecting every moment that our lashings would either give way, that the remains of the windlass would go by the board, or that some of the huge seas, which roared in every direction around us and above us, would drive the hulk so far beneath the water that we should be drowned before it could regain the surface.|2|108|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
By the mercy of God, however, we were preserved from these imminent dangers, and about midday were cheered by the light of the blessed sun.|3|108|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Shortly afterward we could perceive a sensible diminution in the force of the wind, when, now for the first time since the latter part of the evening before, Augustus spoke, asking Peters, who lay closest to him, if he thought there was any possibility of our being saved.|4|108|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As no reply was at first made to this question, we all concluded that the hybrid had been drowned where he lay; but presently, to our great joy, he spoke, although very feebly, saying that he was in great pain, being so cut by the tightness of his lashings across the stomach, that he must either find means of loosening them or perish, as it was impossible that he could endure his misery much longer.|5|108|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This occasioned us great distress, as it was altogether useless to think of aiding him in any manner while the sea continued washing over us as it did.|6|108|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We exhorted him to bear his sufferings with fortitude, and promised to seize the first opportunity which should offer itself to relieve him.|7|108|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He replied that it would soon be too late; that it would be all over with him before we could help him; and then, after moaning for some minutes, lay silent, when we concluded that he had perished.|8|108|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As the evening drew on, the sea had fAllan so much that scarcely more than one wave broke over the hulk from windward in the course of five minutes, and the wind had abated a great deal, although still blowing a severe gale.|0|109|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I had not heard any of my companions speak for hours, and now called to Augustus.|1|109|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He replied, although very feebly, so that I could not distinguish what he said.|2|109|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I then spoke to Peters and to Parker, neither of whom returned any answer.|3|109|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Shortly after this period I fell into a state of partial insensibility, during which the most pleasing images floated in my imagination; such as green trees, waving meadows of ripe grain, processions of dancing girls, troops of cavalry, and other phantasies.|0|110|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I now remember that, in all which passed before my mind's eye, motion was a predominant idea.|1|110|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Thus, I never fancied any stationary object, such as a house, a mountain, or any thing of that kind; but windmills, ships, large birds, balloons, people on horseback, carriages driving furiously, and similar moving objects, presented themselves in endless succession.|2|110|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When I recovered from this state, the sun was, as near as I could guess, an hour high.|3|110|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I had the greatest difficulty in bringing to recollection the various circumstances connected with my situation, and for some time remained firmly convinced that I was still in the hold of the brig, near the box, and that the body of Parker was that of Tiger.|4|110|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When I at length completely came to my senses, I found that the wind blew no more than a moderate breeze, and that the sea was comparatively calm; so much so that it only washed over the brig amidships.|0|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My left arm had broken loose from its lashings, and was much cut about the elbow; my right was entirely benumbed, and the hand and wrist swollen prodigiously by the pressure of the rope, which had worked from the shoulder downward.|1|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I was also in great pain from another rope which went about my waist, and had been drawn to an insufferable degree of tightness.|2|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Looking round upon my companions, I saw that Peters still lived, although a thick line was pulled so forcibly around his loins as to give him the appearance of being cut nearly in two; as I stiffed, he made a feeble motion to me with his hand, pointing to the rope.|3|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Augustus gave no indication of life whatever, and was bent nearly double across a splinter of the windlass.|4|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Parker spoke to me when he saw me moving, and asked me if I had not sufficient strength to release him from his situation, saying that if I would summon up what spirits I could, and contrive to untie him, we might yet save our lives; but that otherwise we must all perish.|5|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I told him to take courage, and I would endeavor to free him.|6|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Feeling in my pantaloons' pocket, I got hold of my penknife, and, after several ineffectual attempts, at length succeeded in opening it.|7|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I then, with my left hand, managed to free my right from its fastenings, and afterward cut the other ropes which held me.|8|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon attempting, however, to move from my position, I found that my legs failed me altogether, and that I could not get up; neither could I move my right arm in any direction.|9|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon mentioning this to Parker, he advised me to lie quiet for a few minutes, holding on to the windlass with my left hand, so as to allow time for the blood to circulate.|10|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Doing this, the numbness presently began to die away so that I could move first one of my legs, and then the other, and, shortly afterward I regained the partial use of my right arm.|11|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I now crawled with great caution toward Parker, without getting on my legs, and soon cut loose all the lashings about him, when, after a short delay, he also recovered the partial use of his limbs.|12|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We now lost no time in getting loose the rope from Peters.|13|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It had cut a deep gash through the waistband of his woollen pantaloons, and through two shirts, and made its way into his groin, from which the blood flowed out copiously as we removed the cordage.|14|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
No sooner had we removed it, however, than he spoke, and seemed to experience instant relief–being able to move with much greater ease than either Parker or myself–this was no doubt owing to the discharge of blood.|15|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We had little hopes that Augustus would recover, as he evinced no signs of life; but, upon getting to him, we discovered that he had merely swooned from the loss of blood, the bandages we had placed around his wounded arm having been torn off by the water; none of the ropes which held him to the windlass were drawn sufficiently tight to occasion his death.|0|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having relieved him from the fastenings, and got him clear of the broken wood about the windlass, we secured him in a dry place to windward, with his head somewhat lower than his body, and all three of us busied ourselves in chafing his limbs.|1|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In about half an hour he came to himself, although it was not until the next morning that he gave signs of recognizing any of us, or had sufficient strength to speak.|2|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
By the time we had thus got clear of our lashings it was quite dark, and it began to cloud up, so that we were again in the greatest agony lest it should come on to blow hard, in which event nothing could have saved us from perishing, exhausted as we were.|3|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
By good fortune it continued very moderate during the night, the sea subsiding every minute, which gave us great hopes of ultimate preservation.|4|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A gentle breeze still blew from the N. W., but the weather was not at all cold.|5|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Augustus was lashed carefully to windward in such a manner as to prevent him from slipping overboard with the rolls of the vessel, as he was still too weak to hold on at all.|6|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For ourselves there was no such necessity.|7|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We sat close together, supporting each other with the aid of the broken ropes about the windlass, and devising methods of escape from our frightful situation.|8|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We derived much comfort from taking off our clothes and wringing the water from them.|9|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When we put them on after this, they felt remarkably warm and pleasant, and served to invigorate us in no little degree.|10|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We helped Augustus off with his, and wrung them for him, when he experienced the same comfort.|11|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Our chief sufferings were now those of hunger and thirst, and when we looked forward to the means of relief in this respect, our hearts sunk within us, and we were induced to regret that we had escaped the less dreadful perils of the sea.|0|113|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We endeavoured, however, to console ourselves with the hope of being speedily picked up by some vessel and encouraged each other to bear with fortitude the evils that might happen.|1|113|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The morning of the fourteenth at length dawned, and the weather still continued clear and pleasant, with a steady but very light breeze from the N. W. The sea was now quite smooth, and as, from some cause which we could not determine, the brig did not he so much along as she had done before, the deck was comparatively dry, and we could move about with freedom.|0|114|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We had now been better than three entire days and nights without either food or drink, and it became absolutely necessary that we should make an attempt to get up something from below.|1|114|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As the brig was completely full of water, we went to this work despondently, and with but little expectation of being able to obtain anything.|2|114|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We made a kind of drag by driving some nails which we broke out from the remains of the companion-hatch into two pieces of wood.|3|114|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Tying these across each other, and fastening them to the end of a rope, we threw them into the cabin, and dragged them to and fro, in the faint hope of being thus able to entangle some article which might be of use to us for food, or which might at least render us assistance in getting it.|4|114|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We spent the greater part of the morning in this labour without effect, fishing up nothing more than a few bedclothes, which were readily caught by the nails.|5|114|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Indeed, our contrivance was so very clumsy that any greater success was hardly to be anticipated.|6|114|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We now tried the forecastle, but equally in vain, and were upon the brink of despair, when Peters proposed that we should fasten a rope to his body, and let him make an attempt to get up something by diving into the cabin.|0|115|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This proposition we hailed with all the delight which reviving hope could inspire.|1|115|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He proceeded immediately to strip off his clothes with the exception of his pantaloons; and a strong rope was then carefully fastened around his middle, being brought up over his shoulders in such a manner that there was no possibility of its slipping.|2|115|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The undertaking was one of great difficulty and danger; for, as we could hardly expect to find much, if any, provision in the cabin itself, it was necessary that the diver, after letting himself down, should make a turn to the right, and proceed under water a distance of ten or twelve feet, in a narrow passage, to the storeroom, and return, without drawing breath.|3|115|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Everything being ready, Peters now descended in the cabin, going down the companion-ladder until the water reached his chin.|0|116|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He then plunged in, head first, turning to the right as he plunged, and endeavouring to make his way to the storeroom.|1|116|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In this first attempt, however, he was altogether unsuccessful.|2|116|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In less than half a minute after his going down we felt the rope jerked violently (the signal we had agreed upon when he desired to be drawn up).|3|116|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We accordingly drew him up instantly, but so incautiously as to bruise him badly against the ladder.|4|116|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He had brought nothing with him, and had been unable to penetrate more than a very little way into the passage, owing to the constant exertions he found it necessary to make in order to keep himself from floating up against the deck.|5|116|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon getting out he was very much exhausted, and had to rest full fifteen minutes before he could again venture to descend.|6|116|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The second attempt met with even worse success; for he remained so long under water without giving the signal, that, becoming alarmed for his safety, we drew him out without it, and found that he was almost at the last gasp, having, as he said, repeatedly jerked at the rope without our feeling it.|0|117|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This was probably owing to a portion of it having become entangled in the balustrade at the foot of the ladder.|1|117|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This balustrade was, indeed, so much in the way, that we determined to remove it, if possible, before proceeding with our design.|2|117|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As we had no means of getting it away except by main force, we all descended into the water as far as we could on the ladder, and giving a pull against it with our united strength, succeeded in breaking it down.|3|117|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The third attempt was equally unsuccessful with the two first, and it now became evident that nothing could be done in this manner without the aid of some weight with which the diver might steady himself, and keep to the floor of the cabin while making his search.|0|118|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For a long time we looked about in vain for something which might answer this purpose; but at length, to our great joy, we discovered one of the weather-forechains so loose that we had not the least difficulty in wrenching it off.|1|118|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having fastened this securely to one of his ankles, Peters now made his fourth descent into the cabin, and this time succeeded in making his way to the door of the steward's room.|2|118|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To his inexpressible grief, however, he found it locked, and was obliged to return without effecting an entrance, as, with the greatest exertion, he could remain under water not more, at the utmost extent, than a single minute.|3|118|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Our affairs now looked gloomy indeed, and neither Augustus nor myself could refrain from bursting into tears, as we thought of the host of difficulties which encompassed us, and the slight probability which existed of our finally making an escape.|4|118|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But this weakness was not of long duration.|5|118|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Throwing ourselves on our knees to God, we implored His aid in the many dangers which beset us; and arose with renewed hope and vigor to think what could yet be done by mortal means toward accomplishing our deliverance.|6|118|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Shortly afterward an incident occurred which I am induced to look upon as more intensely productive of emotion, as far more replete with the extremes first of delight and then of horror, than even any of the thousand chances which afterward befell me in nine long years, crowded with events of the most startling and, in many cases, of the most unconceived and unconceivable character.|0|119|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We were lying on the deck near the companion-way, and debating the possibility of yet making our way into the storeroom, when, looking toward Augustus, who lay fronting myself, I perceived that he had become all at once deadly pale, and that his lips were quivering in the most singular and unaccountable manner.|1|119|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Greatly alarmed, I spoke to him, but he made me no reply, and I was beginning to think that he was suddenly taken ill, when I took notice of his eyes, which were glaring apparently at some object behind me.|2|119|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I turned my head, and shall never forget the ecstatic joy which thrilled through every particle of my frame, when I perceived a large brig bearing down upon us, and not more than a couple of miles off.|3|119|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I sprung to my feet as if a musket bullet had suddenly struck me to the heart; and, stretching out my arms in the direction of the vessel, stood in this manner, motionless, and unable to articulate a syllable.|4|119|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peters and Parker were equally affected, although in different ways.|5|119|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The former danced about the deck like a madman, uttering the most extravagant rhodomontades, intermingled with howls and imprecations, while the latter burst into tears, and continued for many minutes weeping like a child.|6|119|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The vessel in sight was a large hermaphrodite brig, of a Dutch build, and painted black, with a tawdry gilt figure-head.|0|120|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
She had evidently seen a good deal of rough weather, and, we supposed, had suffered much in the gale which had proved so disastrous to ourselves; for her foretopmast was gone, and some of her starboard bulwarks.|1|120|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When we first saw her, she was, as I have already said, about two miles off and to windward, bearing down upon us.|2|120|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The breeze was very gentle, and what astonished us chiefly was, that she had no other sails set than her foremast and mainsail, with a flying jib–of course she came down but slowly, and our impatience amounted nearly to phrensy.|3|120|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The awkward manner in which she steered, too, was remarked by all of us, even excited as we were.|4|120|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
She yawed about so considerably, that once or twice we thought it impossible she could see us, or imagined that, having seen us, and discovered no person on board, she was about to tack and make off in another direction.|5|120|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon each of these occasions we screamed and shouted at the top of our voices, when the stranger would appear to change for a moment her intention, and again hold on toward us–this singular conduct being repeated two or three times, so that at last we could think of no other manner of accounting for it than by supposing the helmsman to be in liquor.|6|120|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
No person was seen upon her decks until she arrived within about a quarter of a mile of us.|0|121|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We then saw three seamen, whom by their dress we took to be Hollanders.|1|121|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Two of these were lying on some old sails near the forecastle, and the third, who appeared to be looking at us with great curiosity, was leaning over the starboard bow near the bowsprit.|2|121|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This last was a stout and tall man, with a very dark skin.|3|121|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He seemed by his manner to be encouraging us to have patience, nodding to us in a cheerful although rather odd way, and smiling constantly, so as to display a set of the most brilliantly white teeth.|4|121|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As his vessel drew nearer, we saw a red flannel cap which he had on fall from his head into the water; but of this he took little or no notice, continuing his odd smiles and gesticulations.|5|121|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I relate these things and circumstances minutely, and I relate them, it must be understood, precisely as they appeared to us.|6|121|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The brig came on slowly, and now more steadily than before, and–I cannot speak calmly of this event-our hearts leaped up wildly within us, and we poured out our whole souls in shouts and thanksgiving to God for the complete, unexpected, and glorious deliverance that was so palpably at hand.|0|122|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Of a sudden, and all at once, there came wafted over the ocean from the strange vessel (which was now close upon us) a smell, a stench, such as the whole world has no name for–no conception of–hellish–utterly suffocating–insufferable, inconceivable.|1|122|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I gasped for breath, and turning to my companions, perceived that they were paler than marble.|2|122|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But we had now no time left for question or surmise–the brig was within fifty feet of us, and it seemed to be her intention to run under our counter, that we might board her without putting out a boat.|3|122|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We rushed aft, when, suddenly, a wide yaw threw her off full five or six points from the course she had been running, and, as she passed under our stern at the distance of about twenty feet, we had a full view of her decks.|4|122|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Shall I ever forget the triple horror of that spectacle?|5|122|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Twenty-five or thirty human bodies, among whom were several females, lay scattered about between the counter and the galley in the last and most loathsome state of putrefaction.|6|122|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We plainly saw that not a soul lived in that fated vessel!|7|122|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Yet we could not help shouting to the dead for help!|8|122|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Yes, long and loudly did we beg, in the agony of the moment, that those silent and disgusting images would stay for us, would not abandon us to become like them, would receive us among their goodly company!|9|122|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We were raving with horror and despair–thoroughly mad through the anguish of our grievous disappointment.|10|122|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As our first loud yell of terror broke forth, it was replied to by something, from near the bowsprit of the stranger, so closely resembling the scream of a human voice that the nicest ear might have been startled and deceived.|0|123|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At this instant another sudden yaw brought the region of the forecastle for a moment into view, and we beheld at once the origin of the sound.|1|123|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We saw the tall stout figure still leaning on the bulwark, and still nodding his head to and fro, but his face was now turned from us so that we could not behold it.|2|123|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
His arms were extended over the rail, and the palms of his hands fell outward.|3|123|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
His knees were lodged upon a stout rope, tightly stretched, and reaching from the heel of the bowsprit to a cathead.|4|123|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On his back, from which a portion of the shirt had been torn, leaving it bare, there sat a huge sea-gull, busily gorging itself with the horrible flesh, its bill and talons deep buried, and its white plumage spattered all over with blood.|5|123|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As the brig moved farther round so as to bring us close in view, the bird, with much apparent difficulty, drew out its crimsoned head, and, after eyeing us for a moment as if stupefied, arose lazily from the body upon which it had been feasting, and, flying directly above our deck, hovered there a while with a portion of clotted and liver-like substance in its beak.|6|123|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The horrid morsel dropped at length with a sullen splash immediately at the feet of Parker.|7|123|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
May God forgive me, but now, for the first time, there flashed through my mind a thought, a thought which I will not mention, and I felt myself making a step toward the ensanguined spot.|8|123|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I looked upward, and the eyes of Augustus met my own with a degree of intense and eager meaning which immediately brought me to my senses.|9|123|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I sprang forward quickly, and, with a deep shudder, threw the frightful thing into the sea.|10|123|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The body from which it had been taken, resting as it did upon the rope, had been easily swayed to and fro by the exertions of the carnivorous bird, and it was this motion which had at first impressed us with the belief of its being alive.|0|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As the gull relieved it of its weight, it swung round and fell partially over, so that the face was fully discovered.|1|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Never, surely, was any object so terribly full of awe!|2|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The eyes were gone, and the whole flesh around the mouth, leaving the teeth utterly naked.|3|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This, then, was the smile which had cheered us on to hope!|4|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
this the–but I forbear.|5|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The brig, as I have already told, passed under our stern, and made its way slowly but steadily to leeward.|6|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
With her and with her terrible crew went all our gay visions of deliverance and joy.|7|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Deliberately as she went by, we might possibly have found means of boarding her, had not our sudden disappointment and the appalling nature of the discovery which accompanied it laid entirely prostrate every active faculty of mind and body.|8|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We had seen and felt, but we could neither think nor act, until, alas!|9|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
too late.|10|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
How much our intellects had been weakened by this incident may be estimated by the fact, that when the vessel had proceeded so far that we could perceive no more than the half of her hull, the proposition was seriously entertained of attempting to overtake her by swimming!|11|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I have, since this period, vainly endeavoured to obtain some clew to the hideous uncertainty which enveloped the fate of the stranger.|0|125|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Her build and general appearance, as I have before stated, led us to the belief that she was a Dutch trader, and the dresses of the crew also sustained this opinion.|1|125|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We might have easily seen the name upon her stern, and, indeed, taken other observations, which would have guided us in making out her character; but the intense excitement of the moment blinded us to every thing of that nature.|2|125|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
From the saffron-like hue of such of the corpses as were not entirely decayed, we concluded that the whole of her company had perished by the yellow fever, or some other virulent disease of the same fearful kind.|3|125|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
If such were the case (and I know not what else to imagine), death, to judge from the positions of the bodies, must have come upon them in a manner awfully sudden and overwhelming, in a way totally distinct from that which generally characterizes even the most deadly pestilences with which mankind are acquainted.|4|125|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It is possible, indeed, that poison, accidentally introduced into some of their sea-stores, may have brought about the disaster, or that the eating of some unknown venomous species of fish, or other marine animal, or oceanic bird, might have induced it,–but it is utterly useless to form conjectures where all is involved, and will, no doubt, remain for ever involved, in the most appalling and unfathomable mystery.|5|125|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We spent the remainder of the day in a condition of stupid lethargy, gazing after the retreating vessel until the darkness, hiding her from our sight, recalled us in some measure to our senses.|0|126|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The pangs of hunger and thirst then returned, absorbing all other cares and considerations.|1|126|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Nothing, however, could be done until the morning, and, securing ourselves as well as possible, we endeavoured to snatch a little repose.|2|126|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In this I succeeded beyond my expectations, sleeping until my companions, who had not been so fortunate, aroused me at daybreak to renew our attempts at getting up provisions from the hull.|3|126|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was now a dead calm, with the sea as smooth as I have ever known it,–the weather warm and pleasant.|0|127|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The brig was out of sight.|1|127|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We commenced our operations by wrenching off, with some trouble, another of the forechains; and having fastened both to Peters' feet, he again made an endeavour to reach the door of the storeroom, thinking it possible that he might be able to force it open, provided he could get at it in sufficient time; and this he hoped to do, as the hulk lay much more steadily than before.|2|127|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He succeeded very quickly in reaching the door, when, loosening one of the chains from his ankle, be made every exertion to force the passage with it, but in vain, the framework of the room being far stronger than was anticipated.|0|128|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He was quite exhausted with his long stay under water, and it became absolutely necessary that some other one of us should take his place.|1|128|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For this service Parker immediately volunteered; but, after making three ineffectual efforts, found that he could never even succeed in getting near the door.|2|128|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The condition of Augustus's wounded arm rendered it useless for him to attempt going down, as he would be unable to force the room open should be reach it, and it accordingly now devolved upon me to exert myself for our common deliverance.|3|128|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peters had left one of the chains in the passage, and I found, upon plunging in, that I had not sufficient balance to keep me firmly down.|0|129|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I determined, therefore, to attempt no more, in my first effort, than merely to recover the other chain.|1|129|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In groping along the floor of the passage for this, I felt a hard substance, which I immediately grasped, not having time to ascertain what it was, but returning and ascending instantly to the surface.|2|129|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The prize proved to be a bottle, and our joy may be conceived when I say that it was found to be full of port wine.|3|129|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Giving thanks to God for this timely and cheering assistance, we immediately drew the cork with my penknife, and, each taking a moderate sup, felt the most indescribable comfort from the warmth, strength, and spirits with which it inspired us.|4|129|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We then carefully recorked the bottle, and, by means of a handkerchief, swung it in such a manner that there was no possibility of its getting broken.|5|129|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having rested a while after this fortunate discovery, I again descended, and now recovered the chain, with which I instantly came up.|0|130|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I then fastened it on and went down for the third time, when I became fully satisfied that no exertions whatever, in that situation, would enable me to force open the door of the storeroom.|1|130|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I therefore returned in despair.|2|130|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There seemed now to be no longer any room for hope, and I could perceive in the countenances of my companions that they had made up their minds to perish.|0|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The wine had evidently produced in them a species of delirium, which, perhaps, I had been prevented from feeling by the immersion I had undergone since drinking it.|1|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They talked incoherently, and about matters unconnected with our condition, Peters repeatedly asking me questions about Nantucket.|2|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Augustus, too, I remember, approached me with a serious air, and requested me to lend him a pocket-comb, as his hair was full of fish-scales, and he wished to get them out before going on shore.|3|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Parker appeared somewhat less affected, and urged me to dive at random into the cabin, and bring up any article which might come to hand.|4|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To this I consented, and, in the first attempt, after staying under a full minute, brought up a small leather trunk belonging to Captain Barnard.|5|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This was immediately opened in the faint hope that it might contain something to eat or drink.|6|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We found nothing, however, except a box of razors and two linen shirts.|7|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I now went down again, and returned without any success.|8|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As my head came above water I heard a crash on deck, and, upon getting up, saw that my companions had ungratefully taken advantage of my absence to drink the remainder of the wine, having let the bottle fall in the endeavour to replace it before I saw them.|9|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I remonstrated with them on the heartlessness of their conduct, when Augustus burst into tears.|10|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The other two endeavoured to laugh the matter off as a joke, but I hope never again to behold laughter of such a species: the distortion of countenance was absolutely frightful.|11|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Indeed, it was apparent that the stimulus, in the empty state of their stomachs, had taken instant and violent effect, and that they were all exceedingly intoxicated.|12|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
With great difficulty I prevailed upon them to lie down, when they fell very soon into a heavy slumber, accompanied with loud stertorous breathing.|13|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I now found myself, as it were, alone in the brig, and my reflections, to be sure, were of the most fearful and gloomy nature.|14|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
No prospect offered itself to my view but a lingering death by famine, or, at the best, by being overwhelmed in the first gale which should spring up, for in our present exhausted condition we could have no hope of living through another.|15|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The gnawing hunger which I now experienced was nearly insupportable, and I felt myself capable of going to any lengths in order to appease it.|0|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
With my knife I cut off a small portion of the leather trunk, and endeavoured to eat it, but found it utterly impossible to swallow a single morsel, although I fancied that some little alleviation of my suffering was obtained by chewing small pieces of it and spitting them out.|1|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Toward night my companions awoke, one by one, each in an indescribable state of weakness and horror, brought on by the wine, whose fumes had now evaporated.|2|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They shook as if with a violent ague, and uttered the most lamentable cries for water.|3|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Their condition affected me in the most lively degree, at the same time causing me to rejoice in the fortunate train of circumstances which had prevented me from indulging in the wine, and consequently from sharing their melancholy and most distressing sensations.|4|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Their conduct, however, gave me great uneasiness and alarm; for it was evident that, unless some favourable change took place, they could afford me no assistance in providing for our common safety.|5|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I had not yet abandoned all idea being able to get up something from below; but the attempt could not possibly be resumed until some one of them was sufficiently master of himself to aid me by holding the end of the rope while I went down.|6|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Parker appeared to be somewhat more in possession of his senses than the others, and I endeavoured, by every means in my power, to rouse him.|7|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Thinking that a plunge in the sea-water might have a beneficial effect, I contrived to fasten the end of a rope around his body, and then, leading him to the companion-way (he remaining quite passive all the while), pushed him in, and immediately drew him out.|8|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I had good reason to congratulate myself upon having made this experiment; for he appeared much revived and invigorated, and, upon getting out, asked me, in a rational manner, why I had so served him.|9|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having explained my object, he expressed himself indebted to me, and said that he felt greatly better from the immersion, afterward conversing sensibly upon our situation.|10|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We then resolved to treat Augustus and Peters in the same way, which we immediately did, when they both experienced much benefit from the shock.|11|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This idea of sudden immersion had been suggested to me by reading in some medical work the good effect of the shower-bath in a case where the patient was suffering from mania a potu.|12|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Finding that I could now trust my companions to hold the end of the rope, I again made three or four plunges into the cabin, although it was now quite dark, and a gentle but long swell from the northward rendered the hulk somewhat unsteady.|0|133|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In the course of these attempts I succeeded in bringing up two case-knives, a three-gallon jug, empty, and a blanket, but nothing which could serve us for food.|1|133|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I continued my efforts, after getting these articles, until I was completely exhausted, but brought up nothing else.|2|133|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
During the night Parker and Peters occupied themselves by turns in the same manner; but nothing coming to hand, we now gave up this attempt in despair, concluding that we were exhausting ourselves in vain.|3|133|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We passed the remainder of this night in a state of the most intense mental and bodily anguish that can possibly be imagined.|0|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The morning of the sixteenth at length dawned, and we looked eagerly around the horizon for relief, but to no purpose.|1|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The sea was still smooth, with only a long swell from the northward, as on yesterday.|2|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This was the sixth day since we had tasted either food or drink, with the exception of the bottle of port wine, and it was clear that we could hold out but a very little while longer unless something could be obtained.|3|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I never saw before, nor wish to see again, human beings so utterly emaciated as Peters and Augustus.|4|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Had I met them on shore in their present condition I should not have had the slightest suspicion that I had ever beheld them.|5|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Their countenances were totally changed in character, so that I could not bring myself to believe them really the same individuals with whom I had been in company but a few days before.|6|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Parker, although sadly reduced, and so feeble that he could not raise his head from his bosom, was not so far gone as the other two.|7|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He suffered with great patience, making no complaint, and endeavouring to inspire us with hope in every manner he could devise.|8|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For myself, although at the commencement of the voyage I had been in bad health, and was at all times of a delicate constitution, I suffered less than any of us, being much less reduced in frame, and retaining my powers of mind in a surprising degree, while the rest were completely prostrated in intellect, and seemed to be brought to a species of second childhood, generally simpering in their expressions, with idiotic smiles, and uttering the most absurd platitudes.|9|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At intervals, however, they would appear to revive suddenly, as if inspired all at once with a consciousness of their condition, when they would spring upon their feet in a momentary flash of vigour, and speak, for a short period, of their prospects, in a manner altogether rational, although full of the most intense despair.|10|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It is possible, however, that my companions may have entertained the same opinion of their own condition as I did of mine, and that I may have unwittingly been guilty of the same extravagances and imbecilities as themselves–this is a matter which cannot be determined.|11|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
About noon Parker declared that he saw land off the larboard quarter, and it was with the utmost difficulty I could restrain him from plunging into the sea with the view of swimming toward it.|0|135|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peters and Augustus took little notice of what he said, being apparently wrapped up in moody contemplation.|1|135|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon looking in the direction pointed out, I could not perceive the faintest appearance of the shore–indeed, I was too well aware that we were far from any land to indulge in a hope of that nature.|2|135|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was a long time, nevertheless, before I could convince Parker of his mistake.|3|135|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He then burst into a flood of tears, weeping like a child, with loud cries and sobs, for two or three hours, when becoming exhausted, he fell asleep.|4|135|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peters and Augustus now made several ineffectual efforts to swallow portions of the leather.|0|136|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I advised them to chew it and spit it out; but they were too excessively debilitated to be able to follow my advice.|1|136|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I continued to chew pieces of it at intervals, and found some relief from so doing; my chief distress was for water, and I was only prevented from taking a draught from the sea by remembering the horrible consequences which thus have resulted to others who were similarly situated with ourselves.|2|136|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The day wore on in this manner, when I suddenly discovered a sail to the eastward, and on our larboard bow.|0|137|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
She appeared to be a large ship, and was coming nearly athwart us, being probably twelve or fifteen miles distant.|1|137|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
None of my companions had as yet discovered her, and I forbore to tell them of her for the present, lest we might again be disappointed of relief.|2|137|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At length upon her getting nearer, I saw distinctly that she was heading immediately for us, with her light sails filled.|3|137|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I could now contain myself no longer, and pointed her out to my fellow-sufferers.|4|137|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They immediately sprang to their feet, again indulging in the most extravagant demonstrations of joy, weeping, laughing in an idiotic manner, jumping, stamping upon the deck, tearing their hair, and praying and cursing by turns.|5|137|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I was so affected by their conduct, as well as by what I considered a sure prospect of deliverance, that I could not refrain from joining in with their madness, and gave way to the impulses of my gratitude and ecstasy by lying and rolling on the deck, clapping my hands, shouting, and other similar acts, until I was suddenly called to my recollection, and once more to the extreme human misery and despair, by perceiving the ship all at once with her stern fully presented toward us, and steering in a direction nearly opposite to that in which I had at first perceived her.|6|137|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was some time before I could induce my poor companions to believe that this sad reverse in our prospects had actually taken place.|0|138|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They replied to all my assertions with a stare and a gesture implying that they were not to be deceived by such misrepresentations.|1|138|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The conduct of Augustus most sensibly affected me.|2|138|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In spite of all I could say or do to the contrary, he persisted in saying that the ship was rapidly nearing us, and in making preparations to go on board of her.|3|138|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Some seaweed floating by the brig, he maintained that it was the ship's boat, and endeavoured to throw himself upon it, howling and shrieking in the most heartrending manner, when I forcibly restrained him from thus casting himself into the sea.|4|138|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having become in some degree pacified, we continued to watch the ship until we finally lost sight of her, the weather becoming hazy, with a light breeze springing up.|0|139|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As soon as she was entirely gone, Parker turned suddenly toward me with an expression of countenance which made me shudder.|1|139|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There was about him an air of self-possession which I had not noticed in him until now, and before he opened his lips my heart told me what he would say.|2|139|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He proposed, in a few words, that one of us should die to preserve the existence of the others.|3|139|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I had for some time past, dwelt upon the prospect of our being reduced to this last horrible extremity, and had secretly made up my mind to suffer death in any shape or under any circumstances rather than resort to such a course.|0|140|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Nor was this resolution in any degree weakened by the present intensity of hunger under which I laboured.|1|140|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The proposition had not been heard by either Peters or Augustus.|2|140|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I therefore took Parker aside; and mentally praying to God for power to dissuade him from the horrible purpose he entertained, I expostulated with him for a long time, and in the most supplicating manner, begging him in the name of every thing which he held sacred, and urging him by every species of argument which the extremity of the case suggested, to abandon the idea, and not to mention it to either of the other two.|3|140|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He heard all I said without attempting to controvert any of my arguments, and I had begun to hope that he would be prevailed upon to do as I desired.|0|141|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But when I had ceased speaking, he said that he knew very well all I had said was true, and that to resort to such a course was the most horrible alternative which could enter into the mind of man; but that he had now held out as long as human nature could be sustained; that it was unnecessary for all to perish, when, by the death of one, it was possible, and even probable, that the rest might be finally preserved; adding that I might save myself the trouble of trying to turn him from his purpose, his mind having been thoroughly made up on the subject even before the appearance of the ship, and that only her heaving in sight had prevented him from mentioning his intention at an earlier period.|1|141|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I now begged him, if he would not be prevailed upon to abandon his design, at least to defer it for another day, when some vessel might come to our relief; again reiterating every argument I could devise, and which I thought likely to have influence with one of his rough nature.|0|142|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He said, in reply, that he had not spoken until the very last possible moment, that he could exist no longer without sustenance of some kind, and that therefore in another day his suggestion would be too late, as regarded himself at least.|1|142|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Finding that he was not to be moved by anything I could say in a mild tone, I now assumed a different demeanor, and told him that he must be aware I had suffered less than any of us from our calamities; that my health and strength, consequently, were at that moment far better than his own, or than that either of Peters or Augustus; in short, that I was in a condition to have my own way by force if I found it necessary; and that if he attempted in any manner to acquaint the others with his bloody and cannibal designs, I would not hesitate to throw him into the sea.|0|143|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon this he immediately seized me by the throat, and drawing a knife, made several ineffectual efforts to stab me in the stomach; an atrocity which his excessive debility alone prevented him from accomplishing.|1|143|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In the meantime, being roused to a high pitch of anger, I forced him to the vessel's side, with the full intention of throwing him overboard.|2|143|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He was saved from his fate, however, by the interference of Peters, who now approached and separated us, asking the cause of the disturbance.|3|143|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This Parker told before I could find means in any manner to prevent him.|4|143|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The effect of his words was even more terrible than what I had anticipated.|0|144|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Both Augustus and Peters, who, it seems, had long secretly entertained the same fearful idea which Parker had been merely the first to broach, joined with him in his design and insisted upon its immediately being carried into effect.|1|144|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I had calculated that one at least of the two former would be found still possessed of sufficient strength of mind to side with myself in resisting any attempt to execute so dreadful a purpose, and, with the aid of either one of them, I had no fear of being able to prevent its accomplishment.|2|144|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Being disappointed in this expectation, it became absolutely necessary that I should attend to my own safety, as a further resistance on my part might possibly be considered by men in their frightful condition a sufficient excuse for refusing me fair play in the tragedy that I knew would speedily be enacted.|3|144|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I now told them I was willing to submit to the proposal, merely requesting a delay of about one hour, in order that the fog which had gathered around us might have an opportunity of lifting, when it was possible that the ship we had seen might be again in sight.|0|145|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
After great difficulty I obtained from them a promise to wait thus long; and, as I had anticipated (a breeze rapidly coming in), the fog lifted before the hour had expired, when, no vessel appearing in sight, we prepared to draw lots.|1|145|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It is with extreme reluctance that I dwell upon the appalling scene which ensued; a scene which, with its minutest details, no after events have been able to efface in the slightest degree from my memory, and whose stern recollection will embitter every future moment of my existence.|0|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Let me run over this portion of my narrative with as much haste as the nature of the events to be spoken of will permit.|1|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The only method we could devise for the terrific lottery, in which we were to take each a chance, was that of drawing straws.|2|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Small splinters of wood were made to answer our purpose, and it was agreed that I should be the holder.|3|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I retired to one end of the hulk, while my poor companions silently took up their station in the other with their backs turned toward me.|4|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The bitterest anxiety which I endured at any period of this fearful drama was while I occupied myself in the arrangement of the lots.|5|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There are few conditions into which man can possibly fall where he will not feel a deep interest in the preservation of his existence; an interest momentarily increasing with the frailness of the tenure by which that existence may be held.|6|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But now that the silent, definite, and stern nature of the business in which I was engaged (so different from the tumultuous dangers of the storm or the gradually approaching horrors of famine) allowed me to reflect on the few chances I had of escaping the most appalling of deaths–a death for the most appalling of purposes–every particle of that energy which had so long buoyed me up departed like feathers before the wind, leaving me a helpless prey to the most abject and pitiable terror.|7|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I could not, at first, even summon up sufficient strength to tear and fit together the small splinters of wood, my fingers absolutely refusing their office, and my knees knocking violently against each other.|8|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My mind ran over rapidly a thousand absurd projects by which to avoid becoming a partner in the awful speculation.|9|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I thought of falling on my knees to my companions, and entreating them to let me escape this necessity; of suddenly rushing upon them, and, by putting one of them to death, of rendering the decision by lot useless–in short, of every thing but of going through with the matter I had in hand.|10|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At last, after wasting a long time in this imbecile conduct, I was recalled to my senses by the voice of Parker, who urged me to relieve them at once from the terrible anxiety they were enduring.|11|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Even then I could not bring myself to arrange the splinters upon the spot, but thought over every species of finesse by which I could trick some one of my fellow-sufferers to draw the short straw, as it had been agreed that whoever drew the shortest of four splinters from my hand was to die for the preservation of the rest.|12|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Before any one condemn me for this apparent heartlessness, let him be placed in a situation precisely similar to my own.|13|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At length delay was no longer possible, and, with a heart almost bursting from my bosom, I advanced to the region of the forecastle, where my companions were awaiting me.|0|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I held out my hand with the splinters, and Peters immediately drew.|1|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He was free–his, at least, was not the shortest; and there was now another chance against my escape.|2|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I summoned up all my strength, and passed the lots to Augustus.|3|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He also drew immediately, and he also was free; and now, whether I should live or die, the chances were no more than precisely even.|4|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At this moment all the fierceness of the tiger possessed my bosom, and I felt toward my poor fellow-creature, Parker, the most intense, the most diabolical hatred.|5|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But the feeling did not last; and, at length, with a convulsive shudder and closed eyes, I held out the two remaining splinters toward him.|6|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was fully five minutes before he could summon resolution to draw, during which period of heartrending suspense I never once opened my eyes.|7|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Presently one of the two lots was quickly drawn from my hand.|8|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The decision was then over, yet I knew not whether it was for me or against me.|9|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
No one spoke, and still I dared not satisfy myself by looking at the splinter I held.|10|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peters at length took me by the hand, and I forced myself to look up, when I immediately saw by the countenance of Parker that I was safe, and that he it was who had been doomed to suffer.|11|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Gasping for breath, I fell senseless to the deck.|12|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I recovered from my swoon in time to behold the consummation of the tragedy in the death of him who had been chiefly instrumental in bringing it about.|0|148|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He made no resistance whatever, and was stabbed in the back by Peters, when he fell instantly dead.|1|148|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I must not dwell upon the fearful repast which immediately ensued.|2|148|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Such things may be imagined, but words have no power to impress the mind with the exquisite horror of their reality.|3|148|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Let it suffice to say that, having in some measure appeased the raging thirst which consumed us by the blood of the victim, and having by common consent taken off the hands, feet, and head, throwing them together with the entrails, into the sea, we devoured the rest of the body, piecemeal, during the four ever memorable days of the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth of the month.|4|148|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the nineteenth, there coming on a smart shower which lasted fifteen or twenty minutes, we contrived to catch some water by means of a sheet which had been fished up from the cabin by our drag just after the gale.|0|149|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The quantity we took in all did not amount to more than half a gallon; but even this scanty allowance supplied us with comparative strength and hope.|1|149|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the twenty-first we were again reduced to the last necessity.|0|150|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the twenty-second, as we were sitting close huddled together, gloomily revolving over our lamentable condition, there flashed through my mind all at once an idea which inspired me with a bright gleam of hope.|0|151|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I remembered that, when the foremast had been cut away, Peters, being in the windward chains, passed one of the axes into my hand, requesting me to put it, if possible, in a place of security, and that a few minutes before the last heavy sea struck the brig and filled her I had taken this axe into the forecastle and laid it in one of the larboard berths.|1|151|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I now thought it possible that, by getting at this axe, we might cut through the deck over the storeroom, and thus readily supply ourselves with provisions.|2|151|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When I communicated this object to my companions, they uttered a feeble shout of joy, and we all proceeded forthwith to the forecastle.|0|152|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The difficulty of descending here was greater than that of going down in the cabin, the opening being much smaller, for it will be remembered that the whole framework about the cabin companion-hatch had been carried away, whereas the forecastle-way, being a simple hatch of only about three feet square, had remained uninjured.|1|152|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I did not hesitate, however, to attempt the descent; and a rope being fastened round my body as before, I plunged boldly in, feet foremost, made my way quickly to the berth, and at the first attempt brought up the axe.|2|152|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was hailed with the most ecstatic joy and triumph, and the ease with which it had been obtained was regarded as an omen of our ultimate preservation.|3|152|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We now commenced cutting at the deck with all the energy of rekindled hope, Peters and myself taking the axe by turns, Augustus's wounded arm not permitting him to aid us in any degree.|0|153|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As we were still so feeble as to be scarcely able to stand unsupported, and could consequently work but a minute or two without resting, it soon became evident that many long hours would be necessary to accomplish our task–that is, to cut an opening sufficiently large to admit of a free access to the storeroom.|1|153|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This consideration, however, did not discourage us; and, working all night by the light of the moon, we succeeded in effecting our purpose by daybreak on the morning of the twenty-third.|2|153|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peters now volunteered to go down; and, having made all arrangements as before, he descended, and soon returned bringing up with him a small jar, which, to our great joy, proved to be full of olives.|0|154|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having shared these among us, and devoured them with the greatest avidity, we proceeded to let him down again.|1|154|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This time he succeeded beyond our utmost expectations, returning instantly with a large ham and a bottle of Madeira wine.|2|154|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Of the latter we each took a moderate sup, having learned by experience the pernicious consequences of indulging too freely.|3|154|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The ham, except about two pounds near the bone, was not in a condition to be eaten, having been entirely spoiled by the salt water.|4|154|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The sound part was divided among us.|5|154|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peters and Augustus, not being able to restrain their appetite, swallowed theirs upon the instant; but I was more cautious, and ate but a small portion of mine, dreading the thirst which I knew would ensue.|6|154|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We now rested a while from our labors, which had been intolerably severe.|7|154|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
By noon, feeling somewhat strengthened and refreshed, we again renewed our attempt at getting up provisions, Peters and myself going down alternately, and always with more or less success, until sundown.|0|155|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
During this interval we had the good fortune to bring up, altogether, four more small jars of olives, another ham, a carboy containing nearly three gallons of excellent Cape Madeira wine, and, what gave us still more delight, a small tortoise of the Gallipago breed, several of which had been taken on board by Captain Barnard, as the Grampus was leaving port, from the schooner Mary Pitts, just returned from a sealing voyage in the Pacific.|1|155|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In a subsequent portion of this narrative I shall have frequent occasion to mention this species of tortoise.|0|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It is found principally, as most of my readers may know, in the group of islands called the Gallipagos, which, indeed, derive their name from the animal–the Spanish word Gallipago meaning a fresh-water terrapin.|1|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
From the peculiarity of their shape and action they have been sometimes called the elephant tortoise.|2|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They are frequently found of an enormous size.|3|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I have myself seen several which would weigh from twelve to fifteen hundred pounds, although I do not remember that any navigator speaks of having seen them weighing more than eight hundred.|4|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Their appearance is singular, and even disgusting.|5|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Their steps are very slow, measured, and heavy, their bodies being carried about a foot from the ground.|6|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Their neck is long, and exceedingly slender, from eighteen inches to two feet is a very common length, and I killed one, where the distance from the shoulder to the extremity of the head was no less than three feet ten inches.|7|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The head has a striking resemblance to that of a serpent.|8|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They can exist without food for an almost incredible length of time, instances having been known where they have been thrown into the hold of a vessel and lain two years without nourishment of any kind–being as fat, and, in every respect, in as good order at the expiration of the time as when they were first put in.|9|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In one particular these extraordinary animals bear a resemblance to the dromedary, or camel of the desert.|10|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In a bag at the root of the neck they carry with them a constant supply of water.|11|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In some instances, upon killing them after a full year's deprivation of all nourishment, as much as three gallons of perfectly sweet and fresh water have been found in their bags.|12|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Their food is chiefly wild parsley and celery, with purslain, sea-kelp, and prickly pears, upon which latter vegetable they thrive wonderfully, a great quantity of it being usually found on the hillsides near the shore wherever the animal itself is discovered.|13|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They are excellent and highly nutritious food, and have, no doubt, been the means of preserving the lives of thousands of seamen employed in the whale-fishery and other pursuits in the Pacific.|14|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The one which we had the good fortune to bring up from the storeroom was not of a large size, weighing probably sixty-five or seventy pounds.|0|157|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was a female, and in excellent condition, being exceedingly fat, and having more than a quart of limpid and sweet water in its bag.|1|157|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This was indeed a treasure; and, falling on our knees with one accord, we returned fervent thanks to God for so seasonable a relief.|2|157|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We had great difficulty in getting the animal up through the opening, as its struggles were fierce and its strength prodigious.|0|158|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was upon the point of making its escape from Peter's grasp, and slipping back into the water, when Augustus, throwing a rope with a slipknot around its throat, held it up in this manner until I jumped into the hole by the side of Peters, and assisted him in lifting it out.|1|158|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The water we drew carefully from the bag into the jug; which, it will be remembered, had been brought up before from the cabin.|0|159|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having done this, we broke off the neck of a bottle so as to form, with the cork, a kind of glass, holding not quite half a gill.|1|159|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We then each drank one of these measures full, and resolved to limit ourselves to this quantity per day as long as it should hold out.|2|159|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
During the last two or three days, the weather having been dry and pleasant, the bedding we had obtained from the cabin, as well as our clothing, had become thoroughly dry, so that we passed this night (that of the twenty-third) in comparative comfort, enjoying a tranquil repose, after having supped plentifully on olives and ham, with a small allowance of the wine.|0|160|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Being afraid of losing some of our stores overboard during the night, in the event of a breeze springing up, we secured them as well as possible with cordage to the fragments of the windlass.|1|160|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Our tortoise, which we were anxious to preserve alive as long as we could, we threw on its back, and otherwise carefully fastened.|2|160|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
July 24.|0|161|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–This morning saw us wonderfully recruited in spirits and strength.|1|161|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Notwithstanding the perilous situation in which we were still placed, ignorant of our position, although certainly at a great distance from land, without more food than would last us for a fortnight even with great care, almost entirely without water, and floating about at the mercy of every wind and wave on the merest wreck in the world, still the infinitely more terrible distresses and dangers from which we had so lately and so providentially been delivered caused us to regard what we now endured as but little more than an ordinary evil–so strictly comparative is either good or ill.|2|161|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At sunrise we were preparing to renew our attempts at getting up something from the storeroom, when, a smart shower coming on, with some lightning, we turn our attention to the catching of water by means of the sheet we had used before for this purpose.|0|162|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We had no other means of collecting the rain than by holding the sheet spread out with one of the forechain-plates in the middle of it.|1|162|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The water, thus conducted to the centre, was drained through into our jug.|2|162|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We had nearly filled it in this manner, when, a heavy squall coming on from the northward, obliged us to desist, as the hulk began once more to roll so violently that we could no longer keep our feet.|3|162|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We now went forward, and, lashing ourselves securely to the remnant of the windlass as before, awaited the event with far more calmness than could have been anticipated or would have been imagined possible under the circumstances.|4|162|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At noon the wind had freshened into a two-reef breeze, and by night into a stiff gale, accompanied with a tremendously heavy swell.|5|162|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Experience having taught us, however, the best method of arranging our lashings, we weathered this dreary night in tolerable security, although thoroughly drenched at almost every instant by the sea, and in momentary dread of being washed off.|6|162|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Fortunately, the weather was so warm as to render the water rather grateful than otherwise.|7|162|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
July 25.|0|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–This morning the gale had diminished to a mere ten-knot breeze, and the sea had gone down with it so considerably that we were able to keep ourselves dry upon the deck.|1|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To our great grief, however, we found that two jars of our olives, as well as the whole of our ham, had been washed overboard, in spite of the careful manner in which they had been fastened.|2|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We determined not to kill the tortoise as yet, and contented ourselves for the present with a breakfast on a few of the olives, and a measure of water each, which latter we mixed half and half, with wine, finding great relief and strength from the mixture, without the distressing intoxication which had ensued upon drinking the port.|3|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The sea was still far too rough for the renewal of our efforts at getting up provision from the storeroom.|4|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Several articles, of no importance to us in our present situation, floated up through the opening during the day, and were immediately washed overboard.|5|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We also now observed that the hulk lay more along than ever, so that we could not stand an instant without lashing ourselves.|6|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On this account we passed a gloomy and uncomfortable day.|7|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At noon the sun appeared to be nearly vertical, and we had no doubt that we had been driven down by the long succession of northward and northwesterly winds into the near vicinity of the equator.|8|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Toward evening saw several sharks, and were somewhat alarmed by the audacious manner in which an enormously large one approached us.|9|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At one time, a lurch throwing the deck very far beneath the water, the monster actually swam in upon us, floundering for some moments just over the companion-hatch, and striking Peters violently with his tail.|10|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A heavy sea at length hurled him overboard, much to our relief.|11|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In moderate weather we might have easily captured him.|12|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
July 26.|0|164|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–This morning, the wind having greatly abated, and the sea not being very rough, we determined to renew our exertions in the storeroom.|1|164|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
After a great deal of hard labor during the whole day, we found that nothing further was to be expected from this quarter, the partitions of the room having been stove during the night, and its contents swept into the hold.|2|164|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This discovery, as may be supposed, filled us with despair.|3|164|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
July 27.|0|165|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–The sea nearly smooth, with a light wind, and still from the northward and westward.|1|165|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The sun coming out hotly in the afternoon, we occupied ourselves in drying our clothes.|2|165|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Found great relief from thirst, and much comfort otherwise, by bathing in the sea; in this, however, we were forced to use great caution, being afraid of sharks, several of which were seen swimming around the brig during the day.|3|165|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
July 28.|0|166|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–Good weather still.|1|166|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The brig now began to lie along so alarmingly that we feared she would eventually roll bottom up.|2|166|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Prepared ourselves as well as we could for this emergency, lashing our tortoise, waterjug, and two remaining jars of olives as far as possible over to the windward, placing them outside the hull below the main-chains.|3|166|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The sea very smooth all day, with little or no wind.|4|166|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
July 29.|0|167|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–A continuance of the same weather.|1|167|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Augustus's wounded arm began to evince symptoms of mortification.|2|167|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He complained of drowsiness and excessive thirst, but no acute pain.|3|167|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Nothing could be done for his relief beyond rubbing his wounds with a little of the vinegar from the olives, and from this no benefit seemed to be experienced.|4|167|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We did every thing in our power for his comfort, and trebled his allowance of water.|5|167|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
July 30.|0|168|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–An excessively hot day, with no wind.|1|168|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
An enormous shark kept close by the hulk during the whole of the forenoon.|2|168|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We made several unsuccessful attempts to capture him by means of a noose.|3|168|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Augustus much worse, and evidently sinking as much from want of proper nourishment as from the effect of his wounds.|4|168|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He constantly prayed to be relieved from his sufferings, wishing for nothing but death.|5|168|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This evening we ate the last of our olives, and found the water in our jug so putrid that we could not swallow it at all without the addition of wine.|6|168|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Determined to kill our tortoise in the morning.|7|168|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax

–After a night of excessive anxiety and fatigue, owing to the position of the hulk, we set about killing and cutting up our tortoise.|1|169|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He proved to be much smaller than we had supposed, although in good condition,–the whole meat about him not amounting to more than ten pounds.|2|169|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
With a view of preserving a portion of this as long as possible, we cut it into fine pieces, and filled with them our three remaining olive jars and the wine-bottle (all of which had been kept), pouring in afterward the vinegar from the olives.|3|169|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In this manner we put away about three pounds of the tortoise, intending not to touch it until we had consumed the rest.|4|169|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We concluded to restrict ourselves to about four ounces of the meat per day; the whole would thus last us thirteen days.|5|169|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A brisk shower, with severe thunder and lightning, came on about dusk, but lasted so short a time that we only succeeded in catching about half a pint of water.|6|169|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The whole of this, by common consent, was given to Augustus, who now appeared to be in the last extremity.|7|169|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He drank the water from the sheet as we caught it (we holding it above him as he lay so as to let it run into his mouth), for we had now nothing left capable of holding water, unless we had chosen to empty out our wine from the carboy, or the stale water from the jug.|8|169|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Either of these expedients would have been resorted to had the shower lasted.|9|169|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The sufferer seemed to derive but little benefit from the draught.|0|170|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
His arm was completely black from the wrist to the shoulder, and his feet were like ice.|1|170|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We expected every moment to see him breathe his last.|2|170|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He was frightfully emaciated; so much so that, although he weighed a hundred and twenty-seven pounds upon his leaving Nantucket, he now did not weigh more than forty or fifty at the farthest.|3|170|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
His eyes were sunk far in his head, being scarcely perceptible, and the skin of his cheeks hung so loosely as to prevent his masticating any food, or even swallowing any liquid, without great difficulty.|4|170|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
August 1.|0|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–A continuance of the same calm weather, with an oppressively hot sun.|1|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Suffered exceedingly from thirst, the water in the jug being absolutely putrid and swarming with vermin.|2|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We contrived, nevertheless, to swallow a portion of it by mixing it with wine; our thirst, however, was but little abated.|3|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We found more relief by bathing in the sea, but could not avail ourselves of this expedient except at long intervals, on account of the continual presence of sharks.|4|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We now saw clearly that Augustus could not be saved; that he was evidently dying.|5|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We could do nothing to relieve his sufferings, which appeared to be great.|6|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
About twelve o'clock he expired in strong convulsions, and without having spoken for several days.|7|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
His death filled us with the most gloomy forebodings, and had so great an effect upon our spirits that we sat motionless by the corpse during the whole day, and never addressed each other except in a whisper.|8|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was not until some time after dark that we took courage to get up and throw the body overboard.|9|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was then loathsome beyond expression, and so far decayed that, as Peters attempted to lift it, an entire leg came off in his grasp.|10|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As the mass of putrefaction slipped over the vessel's side into the water, the glare of phosphoric light with which it was surrounded plainly discovered to us seven or eight large sharks, the clashing of whose horrible teeth, as their prey was torn to pieces among them, might have been heard at the distance of a mile.|11|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We shrunk within ourselves in the extremity of horror at the sound.|12|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
August 2.|0|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–The same fearfully calm and hot weather.|1|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The dawn found us in a state of pitiable dejection as well as bodily exhaustion.|2|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The water in the jug was now absolutely useless, being a thick gelatinous mass; nothing but frightful-looking worms mingled with slime.|3|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We threw it out, and washed the jug well in the sea, afterward pouring a little vinegar in it from our bottles of pickled tortoise.|4|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Our thirst could now scarcely be endured, and we tried in vain to relieve it by wine, which seemed only to add fuel to the flame, and excited us to a high degree of intoxication.|5|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We afterward endeavoured to relieve our sufferings by mixing the wine with seawater; but this instantly brought about the most violent retchings, so that we never again attempted it.|6|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
During the whole day we anxiously sought an opportunity of bathing, but to no purpose; for the hulk was now entirely besieged on all sides with sharks–no doubt the identical monsters who had devoured our poor companion on the evening before, and who were in momentary expectation of another similar feast.|7|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This circumstance occasioned us the most bitter regret and filled us with the most depressing and melancholy forebodings.|8|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We had experienced indescribable relief in bathing, and to have this resource cut off in so frightful a manner was more than we could bear.|9|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Nor, indeed, were we altogether free from the apprehension of immediate danger, for the least slip or false movement would have thrown us at once within reach of those voracious fish, who frequently thrust themselves directly upon us, swimming up to leeward.|10|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
No shouts or exertions on our part seemed to alarm them.|11|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Even when one of the largest was struck with an axe by Peters and much wounded, he persisted in his attempts to push in where we were.|12|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A cloud came up at dusk, but, to our extreme anguish, passed over without discharging itself.|13|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It is quite impossible to conceive our sufferings from thirst at this period.|14|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We passed a sleepless night, both on this account and through dread of the sharks.|15|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
August 3.|0|173|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–No prospect of relief, and the brig lying still more and more along, so that now we could not maintain a footing upon deck at all.|1|173|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Busied ourselves in securing our wine and tortoise-meat, so that we might not lose them in the event of our rolling over.|2|173|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Got out two stout spikes from the forechains, and, by means of the axe, drove them into the hull to windward within a couple of feet of the water, this not being very far from the keel, as we were nearly upon our beam-ends.|3|173|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To these spikes we now lashed our provisions, as being more secure than their former position beneath the chains.|4|173|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Suffered great agony from thirst during the whole day–no chance of bathing on account of the sharks, which never left us for a moment.|5|173|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Found it impossible to sleep.|6|173|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
August 4.|0|174|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–A little before daybreak we perceived that the hulk was heeling over, and aroused ourselves to prevent being thrown off by the movement.|1|174|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At first the roll was slow and gradual, and we contrived to clamber over to windward very well, having taken the precaution to leave ropes hanging from the spikes we had driven in for the provision.|2|174|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But we had not calculated sufficiently upon the acceleration of the impetus; for, presently the heel became too violent to allow of our keeping pace with it; and, before either of us knew what was to happen, we found ourselves hurled furiously into the sea, and struggling several fathoms beneath the surface, with the huge hull immediately above us.|3|174|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In going under the water I had been obliged to let go my hold upon the rope; and finding that I was completely beneath the vessel, and my strength nearly exhausted, I scarcely made a struggle for life, and resigned myself, in a few seconds, to die.|0|175|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But here again I was deceived, not having taken into consideration the natural rebound of the hull to windward.|1|175|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The whirl of the water upward, which the vessel occasioned in Tolling partially back, brought me to the surface still more violently than I had been plunged beneath.|2|175|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon coming up I found myself about twenty yards from the hulk, as near as I could judge.|3|175|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
She was lying keel up, rocking furiously from side to side, and the sea in all directions around was much agitated, and full of strong whirlpools.|4|175|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I could see nothing of Peters.|5|175|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
An oil-cask was floating within a few feet of me, and various other articles from the brig were scattered about.|6|175|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My principal terror was now on account of the sharks, which I knew to be in my vicinity.|0|176|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In order to deter these, if possible, from approaching me, I splashed the water vigorously with both hands and feet as I swam towards the hulk, creating a body of foam.|1|176|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I have no doubt that to this expedient, simple as it was, I was indebted for my preservation; for the sea all round the brig, just before her rolling over, was so crowded with these monsters, that I must have been, and really was, in actual contact with some of them during my progress.|2|176|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
By great good fortune, however, I reached the side of the vessel in safety, although so utterly weakened by the violent exertion I had used that I should never have been able to get upon it but for the timely assistance of Peters, who, now, to my great joy, made his appearance (having scrambled up to the keel from the opposite side of the hull), and threw me the end of a rope–one of those which had been attached to the spikes.|3|176|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having barely escaped this danger, our attention was now directed to the dreadful imminency of another–that of absolute starvation.|0|177|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Our whole stock of provision had been swept overboard in spite of all our care in securing it; and seeing no longer the remotest possibility of obtaining more, we gave way both of us to despair, weeping aloud like children, and neither of us attempting to offer consolation to the other.|1|177|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Such weakness can scarcely be conceived, and to those who have never been similarly situated will, no doubt, appear unnatural; but it must be remembered that our intellects were so entirely disordered by the long course of privation and terror to which we had been subjected, that we could not justly be considered, at that period, in the light of rational beings.|2|177|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In subsequent perils, nearly as great, if not greater, I bore up with fortitude against all the evils of my situation, and Peters, it will be seen, evinced a stoical philosophy nearly as incredible as his present childlike supineness and imbecility–the mental condition made the difference.|3|177|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The overturning of the brig, even with the consequent loss of the wine and turtle, would not, in fact, have rendered our situation more deplorable than before, except for the disappearance of the bedclothes by which we had been hitherto enabled to catch rainwater, and of the jug in which we had kept it when caught; for we found the whole bottom, from within two or three feet of the bends as far as the keel, together with the keel itself, thickly covered with large barnacles, which proved to be excellent and highly nutritious food.|0|178|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Thus, in two important respects, the accident we had so greatly dreaded proved to be a benefit rather than an injury; it had opened to us a supply of provisions which we could not have exhausted, using it moderately, in a month; and it had greatly contributed to our comfort as regards position, we being much more at ease, and in infinitely less danger, than before.|1|178|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The difficulty, however, of now obtaining water blinded us to all the benefits of the change in our condition.|0|179|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
That we might be ready to avail ourselves, as far as possible, of any shower which might fall we took off our shirts, to make use of them as we had of the sheets–not hoping, of course, to get more in this way, even under the most favorable circumstances, than half a gill at a time.|1|179|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
No signs of a cloud appeared during the day, and the agonies of our thirst were nearly intolerable.|2|179|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At night, Peters obtained about an hour's disturbed sleep, but my intense sufferings would not permit me to close my eyes for a single moment.|3|179|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
August 5.|0|180|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–To-day, a gentle breeze springing up carried us through a vast quantity of seaweed, among which we were so fortunate as to find eleven small crabs, which afforded us several delicious meals.|1|180|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Their shells being quite soft, we ate them entire, and found that they irritated our thirst far less than the barnacles.|2|180|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Seeing no trace of sharks among the seaweed, we also ventured to bathe, and remained in the water for four or five hours, during which we experienced a very sensible diminution of our thirst.|3|180|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Were greatly refreshed, and spent the night somewhat more comfortably than before, both of us snatching a little sleep.|4|180|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
August 6.|0|181|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–This day we were blessed by a brisk and continual rain, lasting from about noon until after dark.|1|181|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Bitterly did we now regret the loss of our jug and carboy; for, in spite of the little means we had of catching the water, we might have filled one, if not both of them.|2|181|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As it was, we contrived to satisfy the cravings of thirst by suffering the shirts to become saturated, and then wringing them so as to let the grateful fluid trickle into our mouths.|3|181|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In this occupation we passed the entire day.|4|181|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
August 7.|0|182|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–Just at daybreak we both at the same instant descried a sail to the eastward, and evidently coming towards us!|1|182|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We hailed the glorious sight with a long, although feeble shout of rapture; and began instantly to make every signal in our power, by flaring the shirts in the air, leaping as high as our weak condition would permit, and even by hallooing with all the strength of our lungs, although the vessel could not have been less than fifteen miles distant.|2|182|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
However, she still continued to near our hulk, and we felt that, if she but held her present course, she must eventually come so close as to perceive us.|3|182|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In about an hour after we first discovered her, we could clearly see the people on her decks.|4|182|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
She was a long, low, and rakish-looking topsail schooner, with a black ball in her foretopsail, and had, apparently, a full crew.|5|182|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We now became alarmed, for we could hardly imagine it possible that she did not observe us, and were apprehensive that she meant to leave us to perish as we were–an act of fiendish barbarity, which, however incredible it may appear, has been repeatedly perpetuated at sea, under circumstances very nearly similar, and by beings who were regarded as belonging to the human species.|6|182|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
* In this instance, however, by the mercy of God, we were destined to be most happily deceived; for, presently we were aware of a sudden commotion on the deck of the stranger, who immediately afterward ran up a British flag, and, hauling her wind, bore up directly upon us.|7|182|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In half an hour more we found ourselves in her cabin.|8|182|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
She proved to be the Jane Guy, of Liverpool, Captain Guy, bound on a sealing and trading voyage to the South Seas and Pacific.|9|182|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
* The case of the brig Polly, of Boston, is one so much in point, and her fate, in many respects, so remarkably similar to our own, that I cannot forbear alluding to it here.|0|183|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This vessel, of one hundred and thirty tons burden, sailed from Boston, with a cargo of lumber and provisions, for Santa Croix, on the twelfth of December, 1811, under the command of Captain Casneau.|1|183|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There were eight souls on board besides the captain–the mate, four seamen, and the cook, together with a Mr. Hunt, and a negro girl belonging to him.|2|183|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the fifteenth, having cleared the shoal of Georges, she sprung a leak in a gale of wind from the southeast, and was finally capsized; but, the masts going by the board, she afterward righted.|3|183|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They remained in this situation, without fire, and with very little provision, for the period of one hundred and ninety-one days (from December the fifteenth to June the twentieth), when Captain Casneau and Samuel Badger, the only survivors, were taken off the wreck by the Fame, of Hull, Captain Featherstone, bound home from Rio Janeiro.|4|183|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When picked up, they were in latitude 28 degrees N., longitude 13 degrees W., having drifted above two thousand miles!|5|183|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the ninth of July the Fame fell in with the brig Dromero, Captain Perkins, who landed the two sufferers in Kennebeck.|6|183|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"""It is natural to inquire how they could float such a vast distance, upon the most frequented part of the Atlantic, and not be discovered all this time."|0|184|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"They were passed by more than a dozen sail, one of which came so nigh them that they could distinctly see the people on deck and on the rigging looking at them; but, to the inexpressible disappointment of the starving and freezing men, they stifled the dictates of compassion, hoisted sail, and cruelly abandoned them to their fate""."|1|184|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The Jane Guy was a fine-looking topsail schooner of a hundred and eighty tons burden.|0|185|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
She was unusually sharp in the bows, and on a wind, in moderate weather, the fastest sailer I have ever seen.|1|185|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Her qualities, however, as a rough sea-boat, were not so good, and her draught of water was by far too great for the trade to which she was destined.|2|185|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For this peculiar service, a larger vessel, and one of a light proportionate draught, is desirable–say a vessel of from three hundred to three hundred and fifty tons.|3|185|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
She should be bark-rigged, and in other respects of a different construction from the usual South Sea ships.|4|185|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It is absolutely necessary that she should be well armed.|5|185|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
She should have, say ten or twelve twelve-pound carronades, and two or three long twelves, with brass blunderbusses, and water-tight arm-chests for each top.|6|185|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Her anchors and cables should be of far greater strength than is required for any other species of trade, and, above all, her crew should be numerous and efficient–not less, for such a vessel as I have described, than fifty or sixty able-bodied men.|7|185|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The Jane Guy had a crew of thirty-five, all able seamen, besides the captain and mate, but she was not altogether as well armed or otherwise equipped, as a navigator acquainted with the difficulties and dangers of the trade could have desired.|8|185|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Captain Guy was a gentleman of great urbanity of manner, and of considerable experience in the southern traffic, to which he had devoted a great portion of his life.|0|186|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He was deficient, however, in energy, and, consequently, in that spirit of enterprise which is here so absolutely requisite.|1|186|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He was part owner of the vessel in which he sailed, and was invested with discretionary powers to cruise in the South Seas for any cargo which might come most readily to hand.|2|186|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He had on board, as usual in such voyages, beads, looking-glasses, tinder-works, axes, hatchets, saws, adzes, planes, chisels, gouges, gimlets, files, spokeshaves, rasps, hammers, nails, knives, scissors, razors, needles, thread, crockery-ware, calico, trinkets, and other similar articles.|3|186|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The schooner sailed from Liverpool on the tenth of July, crossed the Tropic of Cancer on the twenty-fifth, in longitude twenty degrees west, and reached Sal, one of the Cape Verd islands, on the twenty-ninth, where she took in salt and other necessaries for the voyage.|0|187|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the third of August, she left the Cape Verds and steered southwest, stretching over toward the coast of Brazil, so as to cross the equator between the meridians of twenty-eight and thirty degrees west longitude.|1|187|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This is the course usually taken by vessels bound from Europe to the Cape of Good Hope, or by that route to the East Indies.|2|187|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
By proceeding thus they avoid the calms and strong contrary currents which continually prevail on the coast of Guinea, while, in the end, it is found to be the shortest track, as westerly winds are never wanting afterward by which to reach the Cape.|3|187|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was Captain Guy's intention to make his first stoppage at Kerguelen's Land–I hardly know for what reason.|4|187|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the day we were picked up the schooner was off Cape St. Roque, in longitude thirty-one degrees west; so that, when found, we had drifted probably, from north to south, not less than five-and-twenty degrees!|5|187|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On board the Jane Guy we were treated with all the kindness our distressed situation demanded.|0|188|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In about a fortnight, during which time we continued steering to the southeast, with gentle breezes and fine weather, both Peters and myself recovered entirely from the effects of our late privation and dreadful sufferings, and we began to remember what had passed rather as a frightful dream from which we had been happily awakened, than as events which had taken place in sober and naked reality.|1|188|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I have since found that this species of partial oblivion is usually brought about by sudden transition, whether from joy to sorrow or from sorrow to joy–the degree of forgetfulness being proportioned to the degree of difference in the exchange.|2|188|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Thus, in my own case, I now feel it impossible to realize the full extent of the misery which I endured during the days spent upon the hulk.|3|188|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The incidents are remembered, but not the feelings which the incidents elicited at the time of their occurrence.|4|188|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I only know, that when they did occur, I then thought human nature could sustain nothing more of agony.|5|188|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We continued our voyage for some weeks without any incidents of greater moment than the occasional meeting with whaling-ships, and more frequently with the black or right whale, so called in contradistinction to the spermaceti.|0|189|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
These, however, were chiefly found south of the twenty-fifth parallel.|1|189|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the sixteenth of September, being in the vicinity of the Cape of Good Hope, the schooner encountered her first gale of any violence since leaving Liverpool.|2|189|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In this neighborhood, but more frequently to the south and east of the promontory (we were to the westward), navigators have often to contend with storms from the northward, which rage with great fury.|3|189|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They always bring with them a heavy sea, and one of their most dangerous features is the instantaneous chopping round of the wind, an occurrence almost certain to take place during the greatest force of the gale.|4|189|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A perfect hurricane will be blowing at one moment from the northward or northeast, and in the next not a breath of wind will be felt in that direction, while from the southwest it will come out all at once with a violence almost inconceivable.|5|189|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A bright spot to the southward is the sure forerunner of the change, and vessels are thus enabled to take the proper precautions.|6|189|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was about six in the morning when the blow came on with a white squall, and, as usual, from the northward.|0|190|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
By eight it had increased very much, and brought down upon us one of the most tremendous seas I had then ever beheld.|1|190|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Every thing had been made as snug as possible, but the schooner laboured excessively, and gave evidence of her bad qualities as a seaboat, pitching her forecastle under at every plunge and with the greatest difficulty struggling up from one wave before she was buried in another.|2|190|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
just before sunset the bright spot for which we had been on the look-out made its appearance in the southwest, and in an hour afterward we perceived the little headsail we carried flapping listlessly against the mast.|3|190|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In two minutes more, in spite of every preparation, we were hurled on our beam-ends, as if by magic, and a perfect wilderness of foam made a clear breach over us as we lay.|4|190|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The blow from the southwest, however, luckily proved to be nothing more than a squall, and we had the good fortune to right the vessel without the loss of a spar.|5|190|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A heavy cross sea gave us great trouble for a few hours after this, but toward morning we found ourselves in nearly as good condition as before the gale.|6|190|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Captain Guy considered that he had made an escape little less than miraculous.|7|190|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the thirteenth of October we came in sight of Prince Edward's Island, in latitude 46 degrees 53' S., longitude 37 degrees 46' E. Two days afterward we found ourselves near Possession Island, and presently passed the islands of Crozet, in latitude 42 degrees 59' S., longitude 48 degrees E. On the eighteenth we made Kerguelen's or Desolation Island, in the Southern Indian Ocean, and came to anchor in Christmas Harbour, having four fathoms of water.|0|191|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This island, or rather group of islands, bears southeast from the Cape of Good Hope, and is distant therefrom nearly eight hundred leagues.|0|192|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was first discovered in 1772, by the Baron de Kergulen, or Kerguelen, a Frenchman, who, thinking the land to form a portion of an extensive southern continent carried home information to that effect, which produced much excitement at the time.|1|192|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The government, taking the matter up, sent the baron back in the following year for the purpose of giving his new discovery a critical examination, when the mistake was discovered.|2|192|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In 1777, Captain Cook fell in with the same group, and gave to the principal one the name of Desolation Island, a title which it certainly well deserves.|3|192|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon approaching the land, however, the navigator might be induced to suppose otherwise, as the sides of most of the hills, from September to March, are clothed with very brilliant verdure.|4|192|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This deceitful appearance is caused by a small plant resembling saxifrage, which is abundant, growing in large patches on a species of crumbling moss.|5|192|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Besides this plant there is scarcely a sign of vegetation on the island, if we except some coarse rank grass near the harbor, some lichen, and a shrub which bears resemblance to a cabbage shooting into seed, and which has a bitter and acrid taste.|6|192|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The face of the country is hilly, although none of the hills can be called lofty.|0|193|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Their tops are perpetually covered with snow.|1|193|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There are several harbors, of which Christmas Harbour is the most convenient.|2|193|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It is the first to be met with on the northeast side of the island after passing Cape Francois, which forms the northern shore, and, by its peculiar shape, serves to distinguish the harbour.|3|193|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Its projecting point terminates in a high rock, through which is a large hole, forming a natural arch.|4|193|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The entrance is in latitude 48 degrees 40' S., longitude 69 degrees 6' E. Passing in here, good anchorage may be found under the shelter of several small islands, which form a sufficient protection from all easterly winds.|5|193|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Proceeding on eastwardly from this anchorage you come to Wasp Bay, at the head of the harbour.|6|193|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This is a small basin, completely landlocked, into which you can go with four fathoms, and find anchorage in from ten to three, hard clay bottom.|7|193|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A ship might lie here with her best bower ahead all the year round without risk.|8|193|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To the westward, at the head of Wasp Bay, is a small stream of excellent water, easily procured.|9|193|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Some seal of the fur and hair species are still to be found on Kerguelen's Island, and sea elephants abound.|0|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The feathered tribes are discovered in great numbers.|1|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Penguins are very plenty, and of these there are four different kinds.|2|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The royal penguin, so called from its size and beautiful plumage, is the largest.|3|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The upper part of the body is usually gray, sometimes of a lilac tint; the under portion of the purest white imaginable.|4|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The head is of a glossy and most brilliant black, the feet also.|5|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The chief beauty of plumage, however, consists in two broad stripes of a gold color, which pass along from the head to the breast.|6|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The bill is long, and either pink or bright scarlet.|7|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
These birds walk erect; with a stately carriage.|8|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They carry their heads high with their wings drooping like two arms, and, as their tails project from their body in a line with the legs, the resemblance to a human figure is very striking, and would be apt to deceive the spectator at a casual glance or in the gloom of the evening.|9|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The royal penguins which we met with on Kerguelen's Land were rather larger than a goose.|10|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The other kinds are the macaroni, the jackass, and the rookery penguin.|11|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
These are much smaller, less beautiful in plumage, and different in other respects.|12|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Besides the penguin many other birds are here to be found, among which may be mentioned sea-hens, blue peterels, teal, ducks, Port Egmont hens, shags, Cape pigeons, the nelly, sea swallows, terns, sea gulls, Mother Carey's chickens, Mother Carey's geese, or the great peterel, and, lastly, the albatross.|0|195|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The great peterel is as large as the common albatross, and is carnivorous.|0|196|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It is frequently called the break-bones, or osprey peterel.|1|196|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They are not at all shy, and, when properly cooked, are palatable food.|2|196|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In flying they sometimes sail very close to the surface of the water, with the wings expanded, without appearing to move them in the least degree, or make any exertion with them whatever.|3|196|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The albatross is one of the largest and fiercest of the South Sea birds.|0|197|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It is of the gull species, and takes its prey on the wing, never coming on land except for the purpose of breeding.|1|197|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Between this bird and the penguin the most singular friendship exists.|2|197|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Their nests are constructed with great uniformity upon a plan concerted between the two species–that of the albatross being placed in the centre of a little square formed by the nests of four penguins.|3|197|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Navigators have agreed in calling an assemblage of such encampments a rookery.|4|197|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
These rookeries have been often described, but as my readers may not all have seen these descriptions, and as I shall have occasion hereafter to speak of the penguin and albatross, it will not be amiss to say something here of their mode of building and living.|5|197|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When the season for incubation arrives, the birds assemble in vast numbers, and for some days appear to be deliberating upon the proper course to be pursued.|0|198|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At length they proceed to action.|1|198|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A level piece of ground is selected, of suitable extent, usually comprising three or four acres, and situated as near the sea as possible, being still beyond its reach.|2|198|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The spot is chosen with reference to its evenness of surface, and that is preferred which is the least encumbered with stones.|3|198|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This matter being arranged, the birds proceed, with one accord, and actuated apparently by one mind, to trace out, with mathematical accuracy, either a square or other parallelogram, as may best suit the nature of the ground, and of just sufficient size to accommodate easily all the birds assembled, and no more–in this particular seeming determined upon preventing the access of future stragglers who have not participated in the labor of the encampment.|4|198|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
One side of the place thus marked out runs parallel with the water's edge, and is left open for ingress or egress.|5|198|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having defined the limits of the rookery, the colony now begin to clear it of every species of rubbish, picking up stone by stone, and carrying them outside of the lines, and close by them, so as to form a wall on the three inland sides.|0|199|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Just within this wall a perfectly level and smooth walk is formed, from six to eight feet wide, and extending around the encampment–thus serving the purpose of a general promenade.|1|199|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The next process is to partition out the whole area into small squares exactly equal in size.|0|200|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This is done by forming narrow paths, very smooth, and crossing each other at right angles throughout the entire extent of the rookery.|1|200|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At each intersection of these paths the nest of an albatross is constructed, and a penguin's nest in the centre of each square–thus every penguin is surrounded by four albatrosses, and each albatross by a like number of penguins.|2|200|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The penguin's nest consists of a hole in the earth, very shallow, being only just of sufficient depth to keep her single egg from rolling.|3|200|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The albatross is somewhat less simple in her arrangements, erecting a hillock about a foot high and two in diameter.|4|200|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This is made of earth, seaweed, and shells.|5|200|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On its summit she builds her nest.|6|200|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The birds take especial care never to leave their nests unoccupied for an instant during the period of incubation, or, indeed, until the young progeny are sufficiently strong to take care of themselves.|0|201|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
While the male is absent at sea in search of food, the female remains on duty, and it is only upon the return of her partner that she ventures abroad.|1|201|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The eggs are never left uncovered at all–while one bird leaves the nest the other nestling in by its side.|2|201|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This precaution is rendered necessary by the thieving propensities prevalent in the rookery, the inhabitants making no scruple to purloin each other's eggs at every good opportunity.|3|201|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Although there are some rookeries in which the penguin and albatross are the sole population, yet in most of them a variety of oceanic birds are to be met with, enjoying all the privileges of citizenship, and scattering their nests here and there, wherever they can find room, never interfering, however, with the stations of the larger species.|0|202|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The appearance of such encampments, when seen from a distance, is exceedingly singular.|1|202|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The whole atmosphere just above the settlement is darkened with the immense number of the albatross (mingled with the smaller tribes) which are continually hovering over it, either going to the ocean or returning home.|2|202|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At the same time a crowd of penguins are to be observed, some passing to and fro in the narrow alleys, and some marching with the military strut so peculiar to them, around the general promenade ground which encircles the rookery.|3|202|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In short, survey it as we will, nothing can be more astonishing than the spirit of reflection evinced by these feathered beings, and nothing surely can be better calculated to elicit reflection in every well-regulated human intellect.|4|202|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the morning after our arrival in Christmas Harbour the chief mate, Mr. Patterson, took the boats, and (although it was somewhat early in the season) went in search of seal, leaving the captain and a young relation of his on a point of barren land to the westward, they having some business, whose nature I could not ascertain, to transact in the interior of the island.|0|203|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Captain Guy took with him a bottle, in which was a sealed letter, and made his way from the point on which he was set on shore toward one of the highest peaks in the place.|1|203|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It is probable that his design was to leave the letter on that height for some vessel which he expected to come after him.|2|203|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As soon as we lost sight of him we proceeded (Peters and myself being in the mate's boat) on our cruise around the coast, looking for seal.|3|203|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In this business we were occupied about three weeks, examining with great care every nook and corner, not only of Kerguelen's Land, but of the several small islands in the vicinity.|4|203|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Our labours, however, were not crowned with any important success.|5|203|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We saw a great many fur seal, but they were exceedingly shy, and with the greatest exertions, we could only procure three hundred and fifty skins in all.|6|203|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Sea elephants were abundant, especially on the western coast of the mainland, but of these we killed only twenty, and this with great difficulty.|7|203|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the smaller islands we discovered a good many of the hair seal, but did not molest them.|8|203|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We returned to the schooner: on the eleventh, where we found Captain Guy and his nephew, who gave a very bad account of the interior, representing it as one of the most dreary and utterly barren countries in the world.|9|203|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They had remained two nights on the island, owing to some misunderstanding, on the part of the second mate, in regard to the sending a jollyboat from the schooner to take them off.|10|203|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the twelfth we made sail from Christmas Harbour retracing our way to the westward, and leaving Marion's Island, one of Crozet's group, on the larboard.|0|204|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This group, now so well known, and which consists of three circular islands, was first discovered by the Portuguese, and was visited afterward by the Dutch in 1643, and by the French in 1767.|0|205|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The three islands together form a triangle, and are distant from each other about ten miles, there being fine open passages between.|1|205|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The land in all of them is very high, especially in Tristan d'Acunha, properly so called.|2|205|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This is the largest of the group, being fifteen miles in circumference, and so elevated that it can be seen in clear weather at the distance of eighty or ninety miles.|3|205|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A part of the land toward the north rises more than a thousand feet perpendicularly from the sea.|4|205|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A tableland at this height extends back nearly to the centre of the island, and from this tableland arises a lofty cone like that of Teneriffe.|5|205|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The lower half of this cone is clothed with trees of good size, but the upper region is barren rock, usually hidden among the clouds, and covered with snow during the greater part of the year.|6|205|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There are no shoals or other dangers about the island, the shores being remarkably bold and the water deep.|7|205|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the northwestern coast is a bay, with a beach of black sand where a landing with boats can be easily effected, provided there be a southerly wind.|8|205|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Plenty of excellent water may here be readily procured; also cod and other fish may be taken with hook and line.|9|205|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The next island in point of size, and the most westwardly of the group, is that called the Inaccessible.|0|206|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Its precise situation is 37 degrees 17' S. latitude, longitude 12 degrees 24' W. It is seven or eight miles in circumference, and on all sides presents a forbidding and precipitous aspect.|1|206|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Its top is perfectly flat, and the whole region is sterile, nothing growing upon it except a few stunted shrubs.|2|206|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Nightingale Island, the smallest and most southerly, is in latitude 37 degrees 26' S., longitude 12 degrees 12' W. Off its southern extremity is a high ledge of rocky islets; a few also of a similar appearance are seen to the northeast.|0|207|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The ground is irregular and sterile, and a deep valley partially separates it.|1|207|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The shores of these islands abound, in the proper season, with sea lions, sea elephants, the hair and fur seal, together with a great variety of oceanic birds.|0|208|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Whales are also plenty in their vicinity.|1|208|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Owing to the ease with which these various animals were here formerly taken, the group has been much visited since its discovery.|2|208|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The Dutch and French frequented it at a very early period.|3|208|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In 1790, Captain Patten, of the ship Industry, of Philadelphia, made Tristan d'Acunha, where he remained seven months (from August, 1790, to April, 1791) for the purpose of collecting sealskins.|4|208|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In this time he gathered no less than five thousand six hundred, and says that he would have had no difficulty in loading a large ship with oil in three weeks.|5|208|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon his arrival he found no quadrupeds, with the exception of a few wild goats; the island now abounds with all our most valuable domestic animals, which have been introduced by subsequent navigators.|6|208|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I believe it was not long after Captain Patten's visit that Captain Colquhoun, of the American brig Betsey, touched at the largest of the islands for the purpose of refreshment.|0|209|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He planted onions, potatoes, cabbages, and a great many other vegetables, an abundance of all which is now to be met with.|1|209|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In 1811, a Captain Haywood, in the Nereus, visited Tristan.|0|210|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He found there three Americans, who were residing upon the island to prepare sealskins and oil.|1|210|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
One of these men was named Jonathan Lambert, and he called himself the sovereign of the country.|2|210|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He had cleared and cultivated about sixty acres of land, and turned his attention to raising the coffee-plant and sugar-cane, with which he had been furnished by the American Minister at Rio Janeiro.|3|210|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This settlement, however, was finally abandoned, and in 1817 the islands were taken possession of by the British Government, who sent a detachment for that purpose from the Cape of Good Hope.|4|210|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They did not, however, retain them long; but, upon the evacuation of the country as a British possession, two or three English families took up their residence there independently of the Government.|5|210|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the twenty-fifth of March, 1824, the Berwick, Captain Jeffrey, from London to Van Diemen's Land, arrived at the place, where they found an Englishman of the name of Glass, formerly a corporal in the British artillery.|6|210|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He claimed to be supreme governor of the islands, and had under his control twenty-one men and three women.|7|210|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He gave a very favourable account of the salubrity of the climate and of the productiveness of the soil.|8|210|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The population occupied themselves chiefly in collecting sealskins and sea elephant oil, with which they traded to the Cape of Good Hope, Glass owning a small schooner.|9|210|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At the period of our arrival the governor was still a resident, but his little community had multiplied, there being fifty-six persons upon Tristan, besides a smaller settlement of seven on Nightingale Island.|10|210|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We had no difficulty in procuring almost every kind of refreshment which we required–sheep, hogs, bullocks, rabbits, poultry, goats, fish in great variety, and vegetables were abundant.|11|210|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having come to anchor close in with the large island, in eighteen fathoms, we took all we wanted on board very conveniently.|12|210|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Captain Guy also purchased of Glass five hundred sealskins and some ivory.|13|210|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We remained here a week, during which the prevailing winds were from the northward and westward, and the weather somewhat hazy.|14|210|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the fifth of November we made sail to the southward and westward, with the intention of having a thorough search for a group of islands called the Auroras, respecting whose existence a great diversity of opinion has existed.|15|210|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
These islands are said to have been discovered as early as 1762, by the commander of the ship Aurora.|0|211|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In 1790, Captain Manuel de Oyarvido,, in the ship Princess, belonging to the Royal Philippine Company, sailed, as he asserts, directly among them.|1|211|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"In 1794, the Spanish corvette Atrevida went with the determination of ascertaining their precise situation, and, in a paper published by the Royal Hydrographical Society of Madrid in the year 1809, the following language is used respecting this expedition: ""The corvette Atrevida practised, in their immediate vicinity, from the twenty-first to the twenty-seventh of January, all the necessary observations, and measured by chronometers the difference of longitude between these islands and the port of Soledad in the Manillas."|2|211|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"The islands are three, they are very nearly in the same meridian; the centre one is rather low, and the other two may be seen at nine leagues' distance""."|3|211|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The observations made on board the Atrevida give the following results as the precise situation of each island.|4|211|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the twenty-seventh of January, 1820, Captain James Weddel, of the British navy, sailed from Staten Land also in search of the Auroras.|0|212|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He reports that, having made the most diligent search and passed not only immediately over the spots indicated by the commander of the Atrevida, but in every direction throughout the vicinity of these spots, he could discover no indication of land.|1|212|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
These conflicting statements have induced other navigators to look out for the islands; and, strange to say, while some have sailed through every inch of sea where they are supposed to lie without finding them, there have been not a few who declare positively that they have seen them; and even been close in with their shores.|2|212|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was Captain Guy's intention to make every exertion within his power to settle the question so oddly in dispute.|3|212|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
* Among the vessels which at various times have professed to meet with the Auroras may be mentioned the ship San Miguel, in 1769; the ship Aurora, in 1774; the brig Pearl, in 1779; and the ship Dolores, in 1790.|0|213|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They all agree in giving the mean latitude fifty-three degrees south.|1|213|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We kept on our course, between the south and west, with variable weather, until the twentieth of the month, when we found ourselves on the debated ground, being in latitude 53 degrees 15' S., longitude 47 degrees 58' W.–that is to say, very nearly upon the spot indicated as the situation of the most southern of the group.|0|214|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Not perceiving any sip of land, we continued to the westward of the parallel of fifty-three degrees south, as far as the meridian of fifty degrees west.|1|214|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We then stood to the north as far as the parallel of fifty-two degrees south, when we turned to the eastward, and kept our parallel by double altitudes, morning and evening, and meridian altitudes of the planets and moon.|2|214|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having thus gone eastwardly to the meridian of the western coast of Georgia, we kept that meridian until we were in the latitude from which we set out.|3|214|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We then took diagonal courses throughout the entire extent of sea circumscribed, keeping a lookout constantly at the masthead, and repeating our examination with the greatest care for a period of three weeks, during which the weather was remarkably pleasant and fair, with no haze whatsoever.|4|214|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Of course we were thoroughly satisfied that, whatever islands might have existed in this vicinity at any former period, no vestige of them remained at the present day.|5|214|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Since my return home I find that the same ground was traced over, with equal care, in 1822, by Captain Johnson, of the American schooner Henry, and by Captain Morrell in the American schooner Wasp–in both cases with the same result as in our own.|6|214|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It had been Captain Guy's original intention, after satisfying himself about the Auroras, to proceed through the Strait of Magellan, and up along the western coast of Patagonia; but information received at Tristan d'Acunha induced him to steer to the southward, in the hope of falling in with some small islands said to lie about the parallel of 60 degrees S., longitude 41 degrees 20' W. In the event of his not discovering these lands, he designed, should the season prove favourable, to push on toward the pole.|0|215|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Accordingly, on the twelfth of December, we made sail in that direction.|1|215|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the eighteenth we found ourselves about the station indicated by Glass, and cruised for three days in that neighborhood without finding any traces of the islands he had mentioned.|2|215|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the twenty-first, the weather being unusually pleasant, we again made sail to the southward, with the resolution of penetrating in that course as far as possible.|3|215|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Before entering upon this portion of my narrative, it may be as well, for the information of those readers who have paid little attention to the progress of discovery in these regions, to give some brief account of the very few attempts at reaching the southern pole which have hitherto been made.|4|215|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
That of Captain Cook was the first of which we have any distinct account.|0|216|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In 1772 he sailed to the south in the Resolution, accompanied by Lieutenant Furneaux in the Adventure.|1|216|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In December he found himself as far as the fifty-eighth parallel of south latitude, and in longitude 26 degrees 57' E. Here he met with narrow fields of ice, about eight or ten inches thick, and running northwest and southeast.|2|216|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This ice was in large cakes, and usually it was packed so closely that the vessel had great difficulty in forcing a passage.|3|216|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At this period Captain Cook supposed, from the vast number of birds to be seen, and from other indications, that he was in the near vicinity of land.|4|216|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He kept on to the southward, the weather being exceedingly cold, until he reached the sixty-fourth parallel, in longitude 38 degrees 14' W..|5|216|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Here he had mild weather, with gentle breezes, for five days, the thermometer being at thirty-six.|6|216|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In January, 1773, the vessels crossed the Antarctic circle, but did not succeed in penetrating much farther; for upon reaching latitude 67 degrees 15' they found all farther progress impeded by an immense body of ice, extending all along the southern horizon as far as the eye could reach.|7|216|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This ice was of every variety–and some large floes of it, miles in extent, formed a compact mass, rising eighteen or twenty feet above the water.|8|216|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It being late in the season, and no hope entertained of rounding these obstructions, Captain Cook now reluctantly turned to the northward.|9|216|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In the November following he renewed his search in the Antarctic.|0|217|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In latitude 59 degrees 40' he met with a strong current setting to the southward.|1|217|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In December, when the vessels were in latitude 67 degrees 31', longitude 142 degrees 54' W., the cold was excessive, with heavy gales and fog.|2|217|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Here also birds were abundant; the albatross, the penguin, and the peterel especially.|3|217|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In latitude 70 degrees 23' some large islands of ice were encountered, and shortly afterward the clouds to the southward were observed to be of a snowy whiteness, indicating the vicinity of field ice.|4|217|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In latitude 71 degrees 10', longitude 106 degrees 54' W., the navigators were stopped, as before, by an immense frozen expanse, which filled the whole area of the southern horizon.|5|217|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The northern edge of this expanse was ragged and broken, so firmly wedged together as to be utterly impassible, and extending about a mile to the southward.|6|217|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Behind it the frozen surface was comparatively smooth for some distance, until terminated in the extreme background by gigantic ranges of ice mountains, the one towering above the other.|7|217|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Captain Cook concluded that this vast field reached the southern pole or was joined to a continent.|8|217|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Mr. J. N. Reynolds, whose great exertions and perseverance have at length succeeded in getting set on foot a national expedition, partly for the purpose of exploring these regions, thus speaks of the attempt of the Resolution.|9|217|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"""We are not surprised that Captain Cook was unable to go beyond 71 degrees 10', but we are astonished that he did attain that point on the meridian of 106 degrees 54' west longitude."|10|217|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Palmer's Land lies south of the Shetland, latitude sixty-four degrees, and tends to the southward and westward farther than any navigator has yet penetrated.|11|217|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"Cook was standing for this land when his progress was arrested by the ice; which, we apprehend, must always be the case in that point, and so early in the season as the sixth of January–and we should not be surprised if a portion of the icy mountains described was attached to the main body of Palmer's Land, or to some other portions of land lying farther to the southward and westward""."|12|217|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In 1803, Captains Kreutzenstern and Lisiausky were dispatched by Alexander of Russia for the purpose of circumnavigating the globe.|0|218|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In endeavouring to get south, they made no farther than 59 degrees 58', in longitude 70 degrees 15' W. They here met with strong currents setting eastwardly.|1|218|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Whales were abundant, but they saw no ice.|2|218|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In regard to this voyage, Mr. Reynolds observes that, if Kreutzenstern had arrived where he did earlier in the season, he must have encountered ice–it was March when he reached the latitude specified.|3|218|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The winds, prevailing, as they do, from the southward and westward, had carried the floes, aided by currents, into that icy region bounded on the north by Georgia, east by Sandwich Land and the South Orkneys, and west by the South Shetland islands.|4|218|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In 1822, Captain James Weddell, of the British navy, with two very small vessels, penetrated farther to the south than any previous navigator, and this, too, without encountering extraordinary difficulties.|0|219|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He states that although he was frequently hemmed in by ice before reaching the seventy-second parallel, yet, upon attaining it, not a particle was to be discovered, and that, upon arriving at the latitude of 74 degrees 15', no fields, and only three islands of ice were visible.|1|219|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It is somewhat remarkable that, although vast flocks of birds were seen, and other usual indications of land, and although, south of the Shetlands, unknown coasts were observed from the masthead tending southwardly, Weddell discourages the idea of land existing in the polar regions of the south.|2|219|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the 11th of January, 1823, Captain Benjamin Morrell, of the American schooner Wasp, sailed from Kerguelen's Land with a view of penetrating as far south as possible.|0|220|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the first of February he found himself in latitude 64 degrees 52' S., longitude 118 degrees 27' E. The following passage is extracted from his journal of that date.|1|220|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"""The wind soon freshened to an eleven-knot breeze, and we embraced this opportunity of making to the west,; being however convinced that the farther we went south beyond latitude sixty-four degrees, the less ice was to be apprehended, we steered a little to the southward, until we crossed the Antarctic circle, and were in latitude 69 degrees 15' E. In this latitude there was no field ice, and very few ice islands in sight."|2|220|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Under the date of March fourteenth I find also this entry.|0|221|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The sea was now entirely free of field ice, and there were not more than a dozen ice islands in sight.|1|221|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At the same time the temperature of the air and water was at least thirteen degrees higher (more mild) than we had ever found it between the parallels of sixty and sixty-two south.|2|221|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We were now in latitude 70 degrees 14' S., and the temperature of the air was forty-seven, and that of the water forty-four.|3|221|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In this situation I found the variation to be 14 degrees 27' easterly, per azimuth.|4|221|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I have several times passed within the Antarctic circle, on different meridians, and have uniformly found the temperature, both of the air and the water, to become more and more mild the farther I advanced beyond the sixty-fifth degree of south latitude, and that the variation decreases in the same proportion.|8|221|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"While north of this latitude, say between sixty and sixty-five south, we frequently had great difficulty in finding a passage for the vessel between the immense and almost innumerable ice islands, some of which were from one to two miles in circumference, and more than five hundred feet above the surface of the water""."|9|221|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Being nearly destitute of fuel and water, and without proper instruments, it being also late in the season, Captain Morrell was now obliged to put back, without attempting any further progress to the westward, although an entirely open, sea lay before him.|0|222|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He expresses the opinion that, had not these overruling considerations obliged him to retreat, he could have penetrated, if not to the pole itself, at least to the eighty-fifth parallel.|1|222|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I have given his ideas respecting these matters somewhat at length, that the reader may have an opportunity of seeing how far they were borne out by my own subsequent experience.|2|222|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In 1831, Captain Briscoe, in the employ of the Messieurs Enderby, whale-ship owners of London, sailed in the brig Lively for the South Seas, accompanied by the cutter Tula.|0|223|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"On the twenty-eighth of February, being in latitude 66 degrees 30' S., longitude 47 degrees 31' E., he descried land, and ""clearly discovered through the snow the black peaks of a range of mountains running E. S. E."" He remained in this neighbourhood during the whole of the following month, but was unable to approach the coast nearer than within ten leagues, owing to the boisterous state of the weather."|1|223|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Finding it impossible to make further discovery during this season, he returned northward to winter in Van Diemen's Land.|2|223|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In the beginning of 1832 he again proceeded southwardly, and on the fourth of February was seen to the southeast in latitude 67 degrees 15' longitude 69 degrees 29' W. This was soon found to be an island near the headland of the country he had first discovered.|0|224|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the twenty-first of the month he succeeded in landing on the latter, and took possession of it in the name of William IV, calling it Adelaide's Island, in honour of the English queen.|1|224|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"These particulars being made known to the Royal Geographical Society of London, the conclusion was drawn by that body ""that there is a continuous tract of land extending from 47 degrees 30' E. to 69 degrees 29' W. longitude, running the parallel of from sixty-six to sixty-seven degrees south latitude""."|2|224|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"In respect to this conclusion Mr. Reynolds observes: ""In the correctness of it we by no means concur; nor do the discoveries of Briscoe warrant any such indifference."|3|224|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"It was within these limits that Weddel proceeded south on a meridian to the east of Georgia, Sandwich Land, and the South Orkney and Shetland islands""."|4|224|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My own experience will be found to testify most directly to the falsity of the conclusion arrived at by the society.|5|224|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
These are the principal attempts which have been made at penetrating to a high southern latitude, and it will now be seen that there remained, previous to the voyage of the Jane, nearly three hundred degrees of longitude in which the Antarctic circle had not been crossed at all.|0|225|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Of course a wide field lay before us for discovery, and it was with feelings of most intense interest that I heard Captain Guy express his resolution of pushing boldly to the southward.|1|225|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We kept our course southwardly for four days after giving up the search for Glass's islands, without meeting with any ice at all.|0|226|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the twenty-sixth, at noon, we were in latitude 63 degrees 23' S., longitude 41 degrees 25' W. We now saw several large ice islands, and a floe of field ice, not, however, of any great extent.|1|226|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The winds generally blew from the southeast, or the northeast, but were very light.|2|226|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Whenever we had a westerly wind, which was seldom, it was invariably attended with a rain squall.|3|226|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Every day we had more or less snow.|4|226|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The thermometer, on the twenty-seventh stood at thirty-five.|5|226|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
January 1, 1828.|0|227|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–This day we found ourselves completely hemmed in by the ice, and our prospects looked cheerless indeed.|1|227|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A strong gale blew, during the whole forenoon, from the northeast, and drove large cakes of the drift against the rudder and counter with such violence that we all trembled for the consequences.|2|227|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Toward evening, the gale still blowing with fury, a large field in front separated, and we were enabled, by carrying a press of sail to force a passage through the smaller flakes into some open water beyond.|3|227|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As we approached this space we took in sail by degrees, and having at length got clear, lay-to under a single.|4|227|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax

–We had now tolerably pleasant weather.|1|228|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At noon we found ourselves in latitude 69 degrees 10' S, longitude 42 degrees 20' W, having crossed the Antarctic circle.|2|228|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Very little ice was to be seen to the southward, although large fields of it lay behind us.|3|228|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This day we rigged some sounding gear, using a large iron pot capable of holding twenty gallons, and a line of two hundred fathoms.|4|228|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We found the current setting to the north, about a quarter of a mile per hour.|5|228|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The temperature of the air was now about thirty-three.|6|228|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Here we found the variation to be 14 degrees 28' easterly, per azimuth.|7|228|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
January 5.|0|229|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–We had still held on to the southward without any very great impediments.|1|229|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On this morning, however, being in latitude 73 degrees 15' E., longitude 42 degrees 10' W, we were again brought to a stand by an immense expanse of firm ice.|2|229|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We saw, nevertheless, much open water to the southward, and felt no doubt of being able to reach it eventually.|3|229|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Standing to the eastward along the edge of the floe, we at length came to a passage of about a mile in width, through which we warped our way by sundown.|4|229|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The sea in which we now were was thickly covered with ice islands, but had no field ice, and we pushed on boldly as before.|5|229|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The cold did not seem to increase, although we had snow very frequently, and now and then hail squalls of great violence.|6|229|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Immense flocks of the albatross flew over the schooner this day, going from southeast to northwest.|7|229|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax

–The sea still remained pretty well open, so that we had no difficulty in holding on our course.|1|230|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To the westward we saw some icebergs of incredible size, and in the afternoon passed very near one whose summit could not have been less than four hundred fathoms from the surface of the ocean.|2|230|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Its girth was probably, at the base, three-quarters of a league, and several streams of water were running from crevices in its sides.|3|230|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We remained in sight of this island two days, and then only lost it in a fog.|4|230|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax

–Early this morning we had the misfortune to lose a man overboard.|1|231|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He was an American named Peter Vredenburgh, a native of New York, and was one of the most valuable hands on board the schooner.|2|231|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In going over the bows his foot slipped, and he fell between two cakes of ice, never rising again.|3|231|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At noon of this day we were in latitude 78 degrees 30', longitude 40 degrees 15' W. The cold was now excessive, and we had hail squalls continually from the northward and eastward.|4|231|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In this direction also we saw several more immense icebergs, and the whole horizon to the eastward appeared to be blocked up with field ice, rising in tiers, one mass above the other.|5|231|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Some driftwood floated by during the evening, and a great quantity of birds flew over, among which were nellies, peterels, albatrosses, and a large bird of a brilliant blue plumage.|6|231|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The variation here, per azimuth, was less than it had been previously to our passing the Antarctic circle.|7|231|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
January 12.|0|232|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
-Our passage to the south again looked doubtful, as nothing was to be seen in the direction of the pole but one apparently limitless floe, backed by absolute mountains of ragged ice, one precipice of which arose frowningly above the other.|1|232|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We stood to the westward until the fourteenth, in the hope of finding an entrance.|2|232|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
January 14.|0|233|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
-This morning we reached the western extremity of the field which had impeded us, and, weathering it, came to an open sea, without a particle of ice.|1|233|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon sounding with two hundred fathoms, we here found a current setting southwardly at the rate of half a mile per hour.|2|233|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The temperature of the air was forty-seven, that of the water thirtyfour.|3|233|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We now sailed to the southward without meeting any interruption of moment until the sixteenth, when, at noon, we were in latitude 81 degrees 21', longitude 42 degrees W. We here again sounded, and found a current setting still southwardly, and at the rate of three quarters of a mile per hour.|4|233|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The variation per azimuth had diminished, and the temperature of the air was mild and pleasant, the thermometer being as high as fifty-one.|5|233|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At this period not a particle of ice was to be discovered.|6|233|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
All hands on board now felt certain of attaining the pole.|7|233|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
January 17.|0|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–This day was full of incident.|1|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Innumerable flights of birds flew over us from the southward, and several were shot from the deck, one of them, a species of pelican, proved to be excellent eating.|2|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
About midday a small floe of ice was seen from the masthead off the larboard bow, and upon it there appeared to be some large animal.|3|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As the weather was good and nearly calm, Captain Guy ordered out two of the boats to see what it was.|4|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Dirk Peters and myself accompanied the mate in the larger boat.|5|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon coming up with the floe, we perceived that it was in the possession of a gigantic creature of the race of the Arctic bear, but far exceeding in size the largest of these animals.|6|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Being well armed, we made no scruple of attacking it at once.|7|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Several shots were fired in quick succession, the most of which took effect, apparently, in the head and body.|8|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Nothing discouraged, however, the monster threw himself from the ice, and swam with open jaws, to the boat in which were Peters and myself.|9|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Owing to the confusion which ensued among us at this unexpected turn of the adventure, no person was ready immediately with a second shot, and the bear had actually succeeded in getting half his vast bulk across our gunwale, and seizing one of the men by the small of his back, before any efficient means were taken to repel him.|10|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In this extremity nothing but the promptness and agility of Peters saved us from destruction.|11|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Leaping upon the back of the huge beast, he plunged the blade of a knife behind the neck, reaching the spinal marrow at a blow.|12|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The brute tumbled into the sea lifeless, and without a struggle, rolling over Peters as he fell.|13|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The latter soon recovered himself, and a rope being thrown him, returned in triumph to the schooner, towing our trophy behind us.|14|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This bear, upon admeasurement, proved to be full fifteen feet in his greatest length.|15|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
His wool was perfectly white, and very coarse, curling tightly.|16|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The eyes were of a blood red, and larger than those of the Arctic bear, the snout also more rounded, rather resembling the snout of the bulldog.|17|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The meat was tender, but excessively rank and fishy, although the men devoured it with avidity, and declared it excellent eating.|18|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"Scarcely had we got our prize alongside, when the man at the masthead gave the joyful shout of ""land on the starboard bow""!"|0|235|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
All hands were now upon the alert, and, a breeze springing up very opportunely from the northward and eastward, we were soon close in with the coast.|1|235|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It proved to be a low rocky islet, of about a league in circumference, and altogether destitute of vegetation, if we except a species of prickly pear.|2|235|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In approaching it from the northward, a singular ledge of rock is seen projecting into the sea, and bearing a strong resemblance to corded bales of cotton.|3|235|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Around this ledge to the westward is a small bay, at the bottom of which our boats effected a convenient landing.|4|235|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It did not take us long to explore every portion of the island, but, with one exception, we found nothing worthy of our observation.|0|236|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In the southern extremity, we picked up near the shore, half buried in a pile of loose stones, a piece of wood, which seemed to have formed the prow of a canoe.|1|236|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There had been evidently some attempt at carving upon it, and Captain Guy fancied that he made out the figure of a tortoise, but the resemblance did not strike me very forcibly.|2|236|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Besides this prow, if such it were, we found no other token that any living creature had ever been here before.|3|236|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Around the coast we discovered occasional small floes of ice–but these were very few.|4|236|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The exact situation of the islet (to which Captain Guy gave the name of Bennet's Islet, in honour of his partner in the ownership of the schooner) is 82 degrees 50' S. latitude, 42 degrees 20' W. longitude.|5|236|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We had now advanced to the southward more than eight degrees farther than any previous navigators, and the sea still lay perfectly open before us.|0|237|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We found, too, that the variation uniformly decreased as we proceeded, and, what was still more surprising, that the temperature of the air, and latterly of the water, became milder.|1|237|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The weather might even be called pleasant, and we had a steady but very gentle breeze always from some northern point of the compass.|2|237|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The sky was usually clear, with now and then a slight appearance of thin vapour in the southern horizon–this, however, was invariably of brief duration.|3|237|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Two difficulties alone presented themselves to our view; we were getting short of fuel, and symptoms of scurvy had occurred among several of the crew.|4|237|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
These considerations began to impress upon Captain Guy the necessity of returning, and he spoke of it frequently.|5|237|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For my own part, confident as I was of soon arriving at land of some description upon the course we were pursuing, and having every reason to believe, from present appearances, that we should not find it the sterile soil met with in the higher Arctic latitudes, I warmly pressed upon him the expediency of persevering, at least for a few days longer, in the direction we were now holding.|6|237|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
So tempting an opportunity of solving the great problem in regard to an Antarctic continent had never yet been afforded to man, and I confess that I felt myself bursting with indignation at the timid and ill-timed suggestions of our commander.|7|237|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I believe, indeed, that what I could not refrain from saying to him on this head had the effect of inducing him to push on.|8|237|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
While, therefore, I cannot but lament the most unfortunate and bloody events which immediately arose from my advice, I must still be allowed to feel some degree of gratification at having been instrumental, however remotely, in opening to the eye of science one of the most intensely exciting secrets which has ever engrossed its attention.|9|237|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
January 18.|0|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–This morning* we continued to the southward, with the same pleasant weather as before.|1|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The sea was entirely smooth, the air tolerably warm and from the northeast, the temperature of the water fifty-three.|2|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We now again got our sounding-gear in order, and, with a hundred and fifty fathoms of line, found the current setting toward the pole at the rate of a mile an hour.|3|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This constant tendency to the southward, both in the wind and current, caused some degree of speculation, and even of alarm, in different quarters of the schooner, and I saw distinctly that no little impression had been made upon the mind of Captain Guy.|4|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He was exceedingly sensitive to ridicule, however, and I finally succeeded in laughing him out of his apprehensions.|5|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The variation was now very trivial.|6|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In the course of the day we saw several large whales of the right species, and innumerable flights of the albatross passed over the vessel.|7|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We also picked up a bush, full of red berries, like those of the hawthorn, and the carcass of a singular-looking land-animal.|8|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was three feet in length, and but six inches in height, with four very short legs, the feet armed with long claws of a brilliant scarlet, and resembling coral in substance.|9|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The body was covered with a straight silky hair, perfectly white.|10|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The tail was peaked like that of a rat, and about a foot and a half long.|11|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The head resembled a cat's, with the exception of the ears–these were flopped like the ears of a dog.|12|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The teeth were of the same brilliant scarlet as the claws.|13|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
* The terms morning and evening, which I have made use of to avoid confusion in my narrative, as far as possible, must not, of course, be taken in their ordinary sense.|0|239|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For a long time past we had had no night at all, the daylight being continual.|1|239|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The dates throughout are according to nautical time, and the bearing must be understood as per compass.|2|239|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I would also remark, in this place, that I cannot, in the first portion of what is here written, pretend to strict accuracy in respect to dates, or latitudes and longitudes, having kept no regular journal until after the period of which this first portion treats.|3|239|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In many instances I have relied altogether upon memory.|4|239|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
January 19.|0|240|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–To-day, being in latitude 83 degrees 20', longitude 43 degrees 5' W. (the sea being of an extraordinarily dark colour), we again saw land from the masthead, and, upon a closer scrutiny, found it to be one of a group of very large islands.|1|240|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The shore was precipitous, and the interior seemed to be well wooded, a circumstance which occasioned us great joy.|2|240|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In about four hours from our first discovering the land we came to anchor in ten fathoms, sandy bottom, a league from the coast, as a high surf, with strong ripples here and there, rendered a nearer approach of doubtful expediency.|3|240|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The two largest boats were now ordered out, and a party, well armed (among whom were Peters and myself), proceeded to look for an opening in the reef which appeared to encircle the island.|4|240|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
After searching about for some time, we discovered an inlet, which we were entering, when we saw four large canoes put off from the shore, filled with men who seemed to be well armed.|5|240|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We waited for them to come up, and, as they moved with great rapidity, they were soon within hail.|6|240|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Captain Guy now held up a white handkerchief on the blade of an oar, when the strangers made a full stop, and commenced a loud jabbering all at once, intermingled with occasional shouts, in which we could distinguish the words Anamoo-moo!|7|240|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
and Lama-Lama!|8|240|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They continued this for at least half an hour, during which we had a good opportunity of observing their appearance.|9|240|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In the four canoes, which might have been fifty feet long and five broad, there were a hundred and ten savages in all.|0|241|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They were about the ordinary stature of Europeans, but of a more muscular and brawny frame.|1|241|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Their complexion a jet black, with thick and long woolly hair.|2|241|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They were clothed in skins of an unknown black animal, shaggy and silky, and made to fit the body with some degree of skill, the hair being inside, except where turned out about the neck, wrists, and ankles.|3|241|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Their arms consisted principally of clubs, of a dark, and apparently very heavy wood.|4|241|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Some spears, however, were observed among them, headed with flint, and a few slings.|5|241|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The bottoms of the canoes were full of black stones about the size of a large egg.|6|241|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When they had concluded their harangue (for it was clear they intended their jabbering for such), one of them who seemed to be the chief stood up in the prow of his canoe, and made signs for us to bring our boats alongside of him.|0|242|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This hint we pretended not to understand, thinking it the wiser plan to maintain, if possible, the interval between us, as their number more than quadrupled our own.|1|242|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Finding this to be the case, the chief ordered the three other canoes to hold back, while he advanced toward us with his own.|2|242|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As soon as he came up with us he leaped on board the largest of our boats, and seated himself by the side of Captain Guy, pointing at the same time to the schooner, and repeating the word Anamoo-moo!|3|242|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
and Lama-Lama!|4|242|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We now put back to the vessel, the four canoes following at a little distance.|5|242|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon getting alongside, the chief evinced symptoms of extreme surprise and delight, clapping his hands, slapping his thighs and breast, and laughing obstreperously.|0|243|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
His followers behind joined in his merriment, and for some minutes the din was so excessive as to be absolutely deafening.|1|243|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Quiet being at length restored, Captain Guy ordered the boats to be hoisted up, as a necessary precaution, and gave the chief (whose name we soon found to be Too-wit) to understand that we could admit no more than twenty of his men on deck at one time.|2|243|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
With this arrangement he appeared perfectly satisfied, and gave some directions to the canoes, when one of them approached, the rest remaining about fifty yards off.|3|243|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Twenty of the savages now got on board, and proceeded to ramble over every part of the deck, and scramble about among the rigging, making themselves much at home, and examining every article with great inquisitiveness.|4|243|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was quite evident that they had never before seen any of the white race–from whose complexion, indeed, they appeared to recoil.|0|244|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They believed the Jane to be a living creature, and seemed to be afraid of hurting it with the points of their spears, carefully turning them up.|1|244|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Our crew were much amused with the conduct of Too-wit in one instance.|2|244|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The cook was splitting some wood near the galley, and, by accident, struck his axe into the deck, making a gash of considerable depth.|3|244|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The chief immediately ran up, and pushing the cook on one side rather roughly, commenced a half whine, half howl, strongly indicative of sympathy in what he considered the sufferings of the schooner, patting and smoothing the gash with his hand, and washing it from a bucket of seawater which stood by.|4|244|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This was a degree of ignorance for which we were not prepared, and for my part I could not help thinking some of it affected.|5|244|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When the visitors had satisfied, as well as they could, their curiosity in regard to our upper works, they were admitted below, when their amazement exceeded all bounds.|0|245|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Their astonishment now appeared to be far too deep for words, for they roamed about in silence, broken only by low ejaculations.|1|245|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The arms afforded them much food for speculation, and they were suffered to handle and examine them at leisure.|2|245|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I do not believe that they had the least suspicion of their actual use, but rather took them for idols, seeing the care we had of them, and the attention with which we watched their movements while handling them.|3|245|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At the great guns their wonder was redoubled.|4|245|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They approached them with every mark of the profoundest reverence and awe, but forbore to examine them minutely.|5|245|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There were two large mirrors in the cabin, and here was the acme of their amazement.|6|245|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Too-wit was the first to approach them, and he had got in the middle of the cabin, with his face to one and his back to the other, before he fairly perceived them.|7|245|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon raising his eyes and seeing his reflected self in the glass, I thought the savage would go mad; but, upon turning short round to make a retreat, and beholding himself a second time in the opposite direction, I was afraid he would expire upon the spot.|8|245|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
No persuasion could prevail upon him to take another look; throwing himself upon the floor, with his face buried in his hands, he remained thus until we were obliged to drag him upon deck.|9|245|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The whole of the savages were admitted on board in this manner, twenty at a time, Too-wit being suffered to remain during the entire period.|0|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We saw no disposition to thievery among them, nor did we miss a single article after their departure.|1|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Throughout the whole of their visit they evinced the most friendly manner.|2|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There were, however, some points in their demeanour which we found it impossible to understand; for example, we could not get them to approach several very harmless objects–such as the schooner's sails, an egg, an open book, or a pan of flour.|3|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We endeavoured to ascertain if they had among them any articles which might be turned to account in the way of traffic, but found great difficulty in being comprehended.|4|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We made out, nevertheless, what greatly astonished us, that the islands abounded in the large tortoise of the Gallipagos, one of which we saw in the canoe of Too-wit.|5|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We saw also some biche de mer in the hands of one of the savages, who was greedily devouring it in its natural state.|6|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
These anomalies–for they were such when considered in regard to the latitude–induced Captain Guy to wish for a thorough investigation of the country, in the hope of making a profitable speculation in his discovery.|7|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For my own part, anxious as I was to know something more of these islands, I was still more earnestly bent on prosecuting the voyage to the southward without delay.|8|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We had now fine weather, but there was no telling how long it would last; and being already in the eighty-fourth parallel, with an open sea before us, a current setting strongly to the southward, and the wind fair, I could not listen with any patience to a proposition of stopping longer than was absolutely necessary for the health of the crew and the taking on board a proper supply of fuel and fresh provisions.|9|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I represented to the captain that we might easily make this group on our return, and winter here in the event of being blocked up by the ice.|10|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He at length came into my views (for in some way, hardly known to myself, I had acquired much influence over him), and it was finally resolved that, even in the event of our finding biche de mer, we should only stay here a week to recruit, and then push on to the southward while we might.|11|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Accordingly we made every necessary preparation, and, under the guidance of Too-wit, got the Jane through the reef in safety, coming to anchor about a mile from the shore, in an excellent bay, completely landlocked, on the southeastern coast of the main island, and in ten fathoms of water, black sandy bottom.|12|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At the head of this bay there were three fine springs (we were told) of good water, and we saw abundance of wood in the vicinity.|13|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The four canoes followed us in, keeping, however, at a respectful distance.|14|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Too-wit himself remained on board, and, upon our dropping anchor, invited us to accompany him on shore, and visit his village in the interior.|15|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To this Captain Guy consented; and ten savages being left on board as hostages, a party of us, twelve in all, got in readiness to attend the chief.|16|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We took care to be well armed, yet without evincing any distrust.|17|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The schooner had her guns run out, her boarding-nettings up, and every other proper precaution was taken to guard against surprise.|18|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Directions were left with the chief mate to admit no person on board during our absence, and, in the event of our not appearing in twelve hours, to send the cutter, with a swivel, around the island in search of us.|19|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At every step we took inland the conviction forced itself upon us that we were in a country differing essentially from any hitherto visited by civilized men.|0|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We saw nothing with which we had been formerly conversant.|1|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The trees resembled no growth of either the torrid, the temperate, of the northern frigid zones, and were altogether unlike those of the lower southern latitudes we had already traversed.|2|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The very rocks were novel in their mass, their color, and their stratification; and the streams themselves, utterly incredible as it may appear, had so little in common with those of other climates, that we were scrupulous of tasting them, and, indeed, had difficulty in bringing ourselves to believe that their qualities were purely those of nature.|3|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At a small brook which crossed our path (the first we had reached) Too-wit and his attendants halted to drink.|4|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On account of the singular character of the water, we refused to taste it, supposing it to be polluted; and it was not until some time afterward we came to understand that such was the appearance of the streams throughout the whole group.|5|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I am at a loss to give a distinct idea of the nature of this liquid, and cannot do so without many words.|6|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Although it flowed with rapidity in all declivities where common water would do so, yet never, except when falling in a cascade, had it the customary appearance of limpidity.|7|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was, nevertheless, in point of fact, as perfectly limpid as any limestone water in existence, the difference being only in appearance.|8|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At first sight, and especially in cases where little declivity was found, it bore re.|9|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
semblance, as regards consistency, to a thick infusion of gum arabic in common water.|10|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But this was only the least remarkable of its extraordinary qualities.|11|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was not colourless, nor was it of any one uniform colour–presenting to the eye, as it flowed, every possible shade of purple; like the hues of a changeable silk.|12|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This variation in shade was produced in a manner which excited as profound astonishment in the minds of our party as the mirror had done in the case of Too-wit.|13|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon collecting a basinful, and allowing it to settle thoroughly, we perceived that the whole mass of liquid was made up of a number of distinct veins, each of a distinct hue; that these veins did not commingle; and that their cohesion was perfect in regard to their own particles among themselves, and imperfect in regard to neighbouring veins.|14|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon passing the blade of a knife athwart the veins, the water closed over it immediately, as with us, and also, in withdrawing it, all traces of the passage of the knife were instantly obliterated.|15|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
If, however, the blade was passed down accurately between the two veins, a perfect separation was effected, which the power of cohesion did not immediately rectify.|16|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The phenomena of this water formed the first definite link in that vast chain of apparent miracles with which I was destined to be at length encircled.|17|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We were nearly three hours in reaching the village, it being more than nine miles in the interior, and the path lying through a rugged country.|0|248|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As we passed along, the party of Too-wit (the whole hundred and ten savages of the canoes) was momentarily strengthened by smaller detachments, of from two to six or seven, which joined us, as if by accident, at different turns of the road.|1|248|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There appeared so much of system in this that I could not help feeling distrust, and I spoke to Captain Guy of my apprehensions.|2|248|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was now too late, however, to recede, and we concluded that our best security lay in evincing a perfect confidence in the good faith of Too-wit.|3|248|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We accordingly went on, keeping a wary eye upon the manoeuvres of the savages, and not permitting them to divide our numbers by pushing in between.|4|248|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In this way, passing through a precipitous ravine, we at length reached what we were told was the only collection of habitations upon the island.|5|248|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As we came in sight of them, the chief set up a shout, and frequently repeated the word Klock-klock, which we sup.|6|248|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
posed to be the name of the village, or perhaps the generic name for villages.|7|248|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The dwellings were of the most miserable description imaginable, and, unlike those of even the lowest of the savage races with which mankind are acquainted, were of no uniform plan.|0|249|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Some of them (and these we found belonged to the Wampoos or Yampoos, the great men of the land) consisted of a tree cut down at about four feet from the root, with a large black skin thrown over it, and hanging in loose folds upon the ground.|1|249|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Under this the savage nestled.|2|249|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Others were formed by means of rough limbs of trees, with the withered foliage upon them, made to recline, at an angle of forty-five degrees, against a bank of clay, heaped up, without regular form, to the height of five or six feet.|3|249|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Others, again, were mere holes dug in the earth perpendicularly, and covered over with similar branches, these being removed when the tenant was about to enter, and pulled on again when he had entered.|4|249|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A few were built among the forked limbs of trees as they stood, the upper limbs being partially cut through, so as to bend over upon the lower, thus forming thicker shelter from the weather.|5|249|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The greater number, however, consisted of small shallow caverns, apparently scratched in the face of a precipitous ledge of dark stone, resembling fuller's earth, with which three sides of the village were bounded.|6|249|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At the door of each of these primitive caverns was a small rock, which the tenant carefully placed before the entrance upon leaving his residence, for what purpose I could not ascertain, as the stone itself was never of sufficient size to close up more than a third of the opening.|7|249|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This village, if it were worthy of the name, lay in a valley of some depth, and could only be approached from the southward, the precipitous ledge of which I have already spoken cutting off all access in other directions.|0|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Through the middle of the valley ran a brawling stream of the same magical-looking water which has been described.|1|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We saw several strange animals about the dwellings, all appearing to be thoroughly domesticated.|2|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The largest of these creatures resembled our common hog in the structure of the body and snout; the tail, however, was bushy, and the legs slender as those of the antelope.|3|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Its motion was exceedingly awkward and indecisive, and we never saw it attempt to run.|4|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We noticed also several animals very similar in appearance, but of a greater length of body, and covered with a black wool.|5|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There were a great variety of tame fowls running about, and these seemed to constitute the chief food of the natives.|6|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To our astonishment we saw black albatross among these birds in a state of entire domestication, going to sea periodically for food, but always returning to the village as a home, and using the southern shore in the vicinity as a place of incubation.|7|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There they were joined by their friends the pelicans as usual, but these latter never followed them to the dwellings of the savages.|8|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Among the other kinds of tame fowls were ducks, differing very little from the canvass-back of our own country, black gannets, and a large bird not unlike the buzzard in appearance, but not carnivorous.|9|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Of fish there seemed to be a great abundance.|10|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We saw, during our visit, a quantity of dried salmon, rock cod, blue dolphins, mackerel, blackfish, skate, conger eels, elephantfish, mullets, soles, parrotfish, leather-jackets, gurnards, hake, flounders, paracutas, and innumerable other varieties.|11|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We noticed, too, that most of them were similar to the fish about the group of Lord Auckland Islands, in a latitude as low as fifty-one degrees south.|12|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The Gallipago tortoise was also very plentiful.|13|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We saw but few wild animals, and none of a large size, or of a species with which we were familiar.|14|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
One or two serpents of a formidable aspect crossed our path, but the natives paid them little attention, and we concluded that they were not venomous.|15|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As we approached the village with Too-wit and his party, a vast crowd of the people rushed out to meet us, with loud shouts, among which we could only distinguish the everlasting Anamoo-moo!|0|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
and Lama-Lama!|1|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We were much surprised at perceiving that, with one or two exceptions, these new comers were entirely naked, and skins being used only by the men of the canoes.|2|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
All the weapons of the country seemed also to be in the possession of the latter, for there was no appearance of any among the villagers.|3|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There were a great many women and children, the former not altogether wanting in what might be termed personal beauty.|4|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They were straight, tall, and well formed, with a grace and freedom of carriage not to be found in civilized society.|5|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Their lips, however, like those of the men, were thick and clumsy, so that, even when laughing, the teeth were never disclosed.|6|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Their hair was of a finer texture than that of the males.|7|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Among these naked villagers there might have been ten or twelve who were clothed, like the party of Too-wit, in dresses of black skin, and armed with lances and heavy clubs.|8|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
These appeared to have great influence among the rest, and were always addressed by the title Wampoo.|9|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
These, too, were the tenants of the black skin palaces.|10|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
That of Too-wit was situated in the centre of the village, and was much larger and somewhat better constructed than others of its kind.|11|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The tree which formed its support was cut off at a distance of twelve feet or thereabouts from the root, and there were several branches left just below the cut, these serving to extend the covering, and in this way prevent its flapping about the trunk.|12|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The covering, too, which consisted of four very large skins fastened together with wooden skewers, was secured at the bottom with pegs driven through it and into the ground.|13|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The floor was strewed with a quantity of dry leaves by way of carpet.|14|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To this hut we were conducted with great solemnity, and as many of the natives crowded in after us as possible.|0|252|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Too-wit seated himself on the leaves, and made signs that we should follow his example.|1|252|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This we did, and presently found ourselves in a situation peculiarly uncomfortable, if not indeed critical.|2|252|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We were on the ground, twelve in number, with the savages, as many as forty, sitting on their hams so closely around us that, if any disturbance had arisen, we should have found it impossible to make use of our arms, or indeed to have risen to our feet.|3|252|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The pressure was not only inside the tent, but outside, where probably was every individual on the whole island, the crowd being prevented from trampling us to death only by the incessant exertions and vociferations of Too-wit.|4|252|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Our chief security lay, however, in the presence of Too-wit himself among us, and we resolved to stick by him closely, as the best chance of extricating ourselves from the dilemma, sacrificing him immediately upon the first appearance of hostile design.|5|252|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
After some trouble a certain degree of quiet was restored, when the chief addressed us in a speech of great length, and very nearly resembling the one delivered in the canoes, with the exception that the Anamoo-moos!|0|253|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
were now somewhat more strenuously insisted upon than the Lama-Lamas!|1|253|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We listened in profound silence until the conclusion of this harangue, when Captain Guy replied by assuring the chief of his eternal friendship and goodwill, concluding what he had to say be a present of several strings of blue beads and a knife.|2|253|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At the former the monarch, much to our surprise, turned up his nose with some expression of contempt, but the knife gave him the most unlimited satisfaction, and he immediately ordered dinner.|3|253|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This was handed into the tent over the heads of the attendants, and consisted of the palpitating entrails of a specials of unknown animal, probably one of the slim-legged hogs which we had observed in our approach to the village.|4|253|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Seeing us at a loss how to proceed, he began, by way of setting us an example, to devour yard after yard of the enticing food, until we could positively stand it no longer, and evinced such manifest symptoms of rebellion of stomach as inspired his majesty with a degree of astonishment only inferior to that brought about by the looking-glasses.|5|253|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We declined, however, partaking of the delicacies before us, and endeavoured to make him understand that we had no appetite whatever, having just finished a hearty dejeuner.|6|253|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When the monarch had made an end of his meal, we commenced a series of cross-questioning in every ingenious manner we could devise, with a view of discovering what were the chief productions of the country, and whether any of them might be turned to profit.|0|254|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At length he seemed to have some idea of our meaning, and offered to accompany us to a part of coast where he assured us the biche de mer (pointing to a specimen of that animal) was to be found in great abundance.|1|254|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We were glad of this early opportunity of escaping from the oppression of the crowd, and signified our eagerness to proceed.|2|254|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We now left the tent, and, accompanied by the whole population of the village, followed the chief to the southeastern extremity of the island, nor far from the bay where our vessel lay at anchor.|3|254|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We waited here for about an hour, until the four canoes were brought around by some of the savages to our station.|4|254|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
the whole of our party then getting into one of them, we were paddled along the edge of the reef before mentioned, and of another still farther out, where we saw a far greater quantity of biche de mer than the oldest seamen among us had ever seen in those groups of the lower latitudes most celebrated for this article of commerce.|5|254|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We stayed near these reefs only long enough to satisfy ourselves that we could easily load a dozen vessels with the animal if necessary, when we were taken alongside the schooner, and parted with Too-wit, after obtaining from him a promise that he would bring us, in the course of twenty-four hours, as many of the canvass-back ducks and Gallipago tortoises as his canoes would hold.|6|254|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In the whole of this adventure we saw nothing in the demeanour of the natives calculated to create suspicion, with the single exception of the systematic manner in which their party was strengthened during our route from the schooner to the village.|7|254|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The chief was as good as his word, and we were soon plentifully sup.|0|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
plied with fresh provisions.|1|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We found the tortoises as fine as we had ever seen, and the ducks surpassed our best species of wild fowl, being exceedingly tender, juicy, and well-flavoured.|2|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Besides these, the savages brought us, upon our making them comprehend our wishes, a vast quantity of brown celery and scurvy grass, with a canoe-load of fresh fish and some dried.|3|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The celery was a treat indeed, and the scurvy grass proved of incalculable benefit in restoring those of our men who had shown symptoms of disease.|4|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In a very short time we had not a single person on the sick-list.|5|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We had also plenty of other kinds of fresh provisions, among which may be mentioned a species of shellfish resembling the mussel in shape, but with the taste of an oyster.|6|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Shrimps, too, and prawns were abundant, and albatross and other birds' eggs with dark shells.|7|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We took in, too, a plentiful stock of the flesh of the hog which I have mentioned before.|8|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Most of the men found it a palpatable food, but I thought it fishy and otherwise disagreeable.|9|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In return for these good things we presented the natives with blue beads, brass trinkets, nails, knives, and pieces of red cloth, they being fully delighted in the exchange.|10|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We established a regular market on shore, just under the guns of the schooner, where our barterings were carried on with every appearance of good faith, and a degree of order which their conduct at the village of Klock-klock had not led us to expect from the savages.|11|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Matters went on thus very amicably for several days, during which parties of the natives were frequently on board the schooner, and parties of our men frequently on shore, making long excursions into the interior, and receiving no molestation whatever.|0|256|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Finding the ease with which the vessel might be loaded with biche de mer, owing to the friendly disposition of the islanders, and the readiness with which they would render us assistance in collecting it, Captain Guy resolved to enter into negotiations with Too-wit for the erection of suitable houses in which to cure the article, and for the services of himself and tribe in gathering as much as possible, while he himself took advantage of the fine weather to prosecute his voyage to the southward.|1|256|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon mentioning this project to the chief he seemed very willing to enter into an agreement.|2|256|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A bargain was accordingly struck, perfectly satisfactory to both parties, by which it was arranged that, after making the necessary preparations, such as laying off the proper grounds, erecting a portion of the buildings, and doing some other work in which the whole of our crew would be required, the schooner should proceed on her route, leaving three of her men on the island to superintend the fulfilment of the project, and instruct the natives in drying the biche de mer.|3|256|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In regard to terms, these were made to depend upon the exertions of the savages in our absence.|4|256|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They were to receive a stipulated quantity of blue beads, knives, red cloth, and so forth, for every certain number of piculs of the biche de mer which should be ready on our return.|5|256|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A description of the nature of this important article of commerce, and the method of preparing it, may prove of some interest to my readers, and I can find no more suitable place than this for introducing an account of it.|0|257|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The following comprehensive notice of the substance is taken from a modern history of a voyage to the South Seas.|1|257|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"""It is that mollusca from the Indian Seas which is known to commerce by the French name bouche de mer (a nice morsel from the sea)."|0|258|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
If I am not much mistaken, the celebrated Cuvier calls it gasteropeda pulmonifera.|1|258|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It is abundantly gathered in the coasts of the Pacific islands, and gathered especially for the Chinese market, where it commands a great price, perhaps as much as their much-talked-of edible birds' nests, which are properly made up of the gelatinous matter picked up by a species of swallow from the body of these molluscae.|2|258|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They have no shell, no legs, nor any prominent part, except an absorbing and an excretory, opposite organs; but, by their elastic wings, like caterpillars or worms, they creep in shallow waters, in which, when low, they can be seen by a kind of swallow, the sharp bill of which, inserted in the soft animal, draws a gummy and filamentous substance, which, by drying, can be wrought into the solid walls of their nest.|3|258|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Hence the name of gasteropeda pulmonifera.|4|258|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"""This mollusca is oblong, and of different sizes, from three to eighteen inches in length; and I have seen a few that were not less than two feet long."|0|259|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They were nearly round, a little flattish on one side, which lies next to the bottom of the sea; and they are from one to eight inches thick.|1|259|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They crawl up into shallow water at particular seasons of the year, probably for the purpose of gendering, as we often find them in pairs.|2|259|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It is when the sun has the most power on the water, rendering it tepid, that they approach the shore; and they often go up into places so shallow that, on the tide's receding, they are left dry, exposed to the beat of the sun.|3|259|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But they do not bring forth their young in shallow water, as we never see any of their progeny, and full-grown ones are always observed coming in from deep water.|4|259|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They feed principally on that class of zoophytes which produce the coral.|5|259|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"""The biche de mer is generally taken in three or four feet of water; after which they are brought on shore, and split at one end with a knife, the incision being one inch or more, according to the size of the mollusca."|0|260|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Through this opening the entrails are forced out by pressure, and they are much like those of any other small tenant of the deep.|1|260|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The article is then washed, and afterward boiled to a certain degree, which must not be too much or too little.|2|260|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They are then buried in the ground for four hours, then boiled again for a short time, after which they are dried, either by the fire or the sun.|3|260|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Those cured by the sun are worth the most; but where one picul (133 1/3 lbs.|4|260|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
) can be cured that way, I can cure thirty piculs by the fire.|5|260|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When once properly cured, they can be kept in a dry place for two or three years without any risk; but they should be examined once in every few months, say four times a year, to see if any dampness is likely to affect them.|6|260|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"""The Chinese, as before stated, consider biche de mer a very great luxury, believing that it wonderfully strengthens and nourishes the system, and renews the exhausted system of the immoderate voluptuary."|0|261|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"The first quality commands a high price in Canton, being worth ninety dollars a picul; the second quality, seventy-five dollars; the third, fifty dollars; the fourth, thirty dollars; the fifth, twenty dollars; the sixth, twelve dollars; the seventh, eight dollars; and the eighth, four dollars; small cargoes, however, will often bring more in Manilla, Singapore, and Batavia""."|1|261|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
An agreement having been thus entered into, we proceeded immediately to land everything necessary for preparing the buildings and clearing the ground.|0|262|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A large flat space near the eastern shore of the bay was selected, where there was plenty of both wood and water, and within a convenient distance of the principal reefs on which the biche de mer was to be procured.|1|262|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We now all set to work in good earnest, and soon, to the great astonishment of the savages, had felled a sufficient number of trees for our purpose, getting them quickly in order for the framework of the houses, which in two or three days were so far under way that we could safely trust the rest of the work to the three men whom we intended to leave behind.|2|262|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
These I believe), who volunteered their services in this respect.|3|262|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
By the last of the month we had everything in readiness for departure.|0|263|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We had agreed, however, to pay a formal visit of leave-taking to the village, and Too-wit insisted so pertinaciously upon our keeping the promise that we did not think it advisable to run the risk of offending him by a final refusal.|1|263|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I believe that not one of us had at this time the slightest suspicion of the good faith of the savages.|2|263|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They had uniformly behaved with the greatest decorum, aiding us with alacrity in our work, offering us their commodities, frequently without price, and never, in any instance, pilfering a single article, although the high value they set upon the goods we had with us was evident by the extravagant demonstrations of joy always manifested upon our making them a present.|3|263|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The women especially were most obliging in every respect, and, upon the whole, we should have been the most suspicious of human beings had we entertained a single thought of perfidy on the part of a people who treated us so well.|4|263|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A very short while sufficed to prove that this apparent kindness of disposition was only the result of a deeply laid plan for our destruction, and that the islanders for whom we entertained such inordinate feelings of esteem, were among the most barbarous, subtle, and bloodthirsty wretches that ever contaminated the face of the globe.|5|263|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was on the first of February that we went on shore for the purpose of visiting the village.|0|264|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Although, as said before, we entertained not the slightest suspicion, still no proper precaution was neglected.|1|264|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Six men were left in the schooner, with instructions to permit none of the savages to approach the vessel during our absence, under any pretence whatever, and to remain constantly on deck.|2|264|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The boarding-nettings were up, the guns double-shotted with grape and canister, and the swivels loaded with canisters of musket-balls.|3|264|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
She lay, with her anchor apeak, about a mile from the shore, and no canoe could approach her in any direction without being distinctly seen and exposed to the full fire of our swivels immediately.|4|264|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The six men being left on board, our shore-party consisted of thirty.|0|265|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
two persons in all.|1|265|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We were armed to the teeth, having with us muskets, pistols, and cutlasses; besides, each had a long kind of seaman's knife, somewhat resembling the bowie knife now so much used throughout our western and southern country.|2|265|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A hundred of the black skin warriors met us at the landing for the purpose of accompanying us on our way.|3|265|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We noticed, however, with some surprise, that they were now entirely without arms; and, upon questioning Too-wit in relation to this circumstance, he merely answered that Mattee non we pa pa si–meaning that there was no need of arms where all were brothers.|4|265|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We took this in good part, and proceeded.|5|265|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We had passed the spring and rivulet of which I before spoke, and were now entering upon a narrow gorge leading through the chain of soapstone hills among which the village was situated.|0|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This gorge was very rocky and uneven, so much so that it was with no little difficulty we scrambled through it on our first visit to Klock-klock.|1|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The whole length of the ravine might have been a mile and a half, or probably two miles.|2|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It wound in every possible direction through the hills (having apparently formed, at some remote period, the bed of a torrent), in no instance proceeding more than twenty yards without an abrupt turn.|3|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The sides of this dell would have averaged, I am sure, seventy or eighty feet in perpendicular altitude throughout the whole of their extent, and in some portions they arose to an astonishing height, overshadowing the pass so completely that but little of the light of day could penetrate.|4|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The general width was about forty feet, and occasionally it diminished so as not to allow the passage of more than five or six persons abreast.|5|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In short, there could be no place in the world better adapted for the consummation of an ambuscade, and it was no more than natural that we should look carefully to our arms as we entered upon it.|6|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
When I now think of our egregious folly, the chief subject of astonishment seems to be, that we should have ever ventured, under any circumstances, so completely into the power of unknown savages as to permit them to march both before and behind us in our progress through this ravine.|7|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Yet such was the order we blindly took up, trusting foolishly to the force of our party, the unarmed condition of Too-wit and his men, the certain efficacy of our firearms (whose effect was yet a secret to the natives), and, more than all, to the long-sustained pretension of friendship kept up by these infamous wretches.|8|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Five or six of them went on before, as if to lead the way, ostentatiously busying themselves in removing the larger stones and rubbish from the path.|9|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Next came our own party.|10|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We walked closely together, taking care only to prevent separation.|11|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Behind followed the main body of the savages, observing unusual order and decorum.|12|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Dirk Peters, a man named Wilson Allan, and myself were on the right of our companions, examining, as we went along, the singular stratification of the precipice which overhung us.|0|267|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A fissure in the soft rock attracted our attention.|1|267|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was about wide enough for one person to enter without squeezing, and extended back into the hill some eighteen or twenty feet in a straight course, sloping afterward to the left.|2|267|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The height of the opening, is far as we could see into it from the main gorge, was perhaps sixty or seventy feet.|3|267|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There were one or two stunted shrubs growing from the crevices, bearing a species of filbert which I felt some curiosity to examine, and pushed in briskly for that purpose, gathering five or six of the nuts at a grasp, and then hastily retreating.|4|267|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As I turned, I found that Peters and Allan had followed me.|5|267|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I desired them to go back, as there was not room for two persons to pass, saying they should have some of my nuts.|6|267|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They accordingly turned, and were scrambling back, Allan being close to the mouth of the fissure, when I was suddenly aware of a concussion resembling nothing I had ever before experienced, and which impressed me with a vague conception, if indeed I then thought of anything, that the whole foundations of the solid globe were suddenly rent asunder, and that the day of universal dissolution was at hand.|7|267|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As soon as I could collect my scattered senses, I found myself nearly suffocated, and grovelling in utter darkness among a quantity of loose earth, which was also falling upon me heavily in every direction, threatening to bury me entirely.|0|268|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Horribly alarmed at this idea, I struggled to gain my feet, and at last succeeded.|1|268|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I then remained motionless for some moments, endeavouring to conceive what had happened to me, and where I was.|2|268|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Presently I heard a deep groan just at my ear, and afterward the smothered voice of Peters calling to me for aid in the name of God.|3|268|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I scrambled one or two paces forward, when I fell directly over the head and shoulders of my companion, who, I soon discovered, was buried in a loose mass of earth as far as his middle, and struggling desperately to free himself from the pressure.|4|268|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I tore the dirt from around him with all the energy I could command, and at length succeeded in getting him out.|5|268|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As soon as we sufficiently recovered from our fright and surprise to be capable of conversing rationally, we both came to the conclusion that the walls of the fissure in which we had ventured had, by some convulsion of nature, or probably from their own weight, caved in overhead, and that we were consequently lost for ever, being thus entombed alive.|0|269|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For a long time we gave up supinely to the most intense agony and despair, such as cannot be adequately imagined by those who have never been in a similar position.|1|269|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I firmly believed that no incident ever occurring in the course of human events is more adapted to inspire the supremeness of mental and bodily distress than a case like our own, of living inhumation.|2|269|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The blackness of darkness which envelops the victim, the terrific oppression of lungs, the stifling fumes from the damp earth, unite with the ghastly considerations that we are beyond the remotest confines of hope, and that such is the allotted portion of the dead, to carry into the human heart a degree of appalling awe and horror not to be tolerated–never to be conceived.|3|269|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At length Peters proposed that we should endeavour to ascertain precisely the extent of our calamity, and grope about our prison; it being barely possible, he observed, that some opening might yet be left us for escape.|0|270|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I caught eagerly at this hope, and, arousing myself to exertion, attempted to force my way through the loose earth.|1|270|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Hardly had I advanced a single step before a glimmer of light became perceptible, enough to convince me that, at all events, we should not immediately perish for want of air.|2|270|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We now took some degree of heart, and encouraged each other to hope for the best.|3|270|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having scrambled over a bank of rubbish which impeded our farther progress in the direction of the light, we found less difficulty in advancing and also experienced some relief from the excessive oppression of lungs which had tormented us.|4|270|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Presently we were enabled to obtain a glimpse of the objects around, and discovered that we were near the extremity of the straight portion of the fissure, where it made a turn to the left.|5|270|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A few struggles more, and we reached the bend, when to our inexpressible joy, there appeared a long seam or crack extending upward a vast distance, generally at an angle of about forty-five degrees, although sometimes much more precipitous.|6|270|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We could not see through the whole extent of this opening; but, as a good deal of light came down it, we had little doubt of finding at the top of it (if we could by any means reach the top) a clear passage into the open air.|7|270|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I now called to mind that three of us had entered the fissure from the main gorge, and that our companion, Allan, was still missing; we determined at once to retrace our steps and look for him.|0|271|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
After a long search, and much danger from the farther caving in of the earth above us, Peters at length cried out to me that he had hold of our companion's foot, and that his whole body was deeply buried beneath the rubbish beyond the possibility of extricating him.|1|271|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I soon found that what he said was too true, and that, of course, life had been long extinct.|2|271|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
With sorrowful hearts, therefore, we left the corpse to its fate, and again made our way to the bend.|3|271|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The breadth of the seam was barely sufficient to admit us, and, after one or two ineffectual efforts at getting up, we began once more to despair.|0|272|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I have before said that the chain of hills through which ran the main gorge was composed of a species of soft rock resembling soap.|1|272|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
stone.|2|272|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The sides of the cleft we were now attempting to ascend were of the same material, and so excessively slippery, being wet, that we could get but little foothold upon them even in their least precipitous parts; in some places, where the ascent was nearly perpendicular, the difficulty was, of course, much aggravated; and, indeed, for some time we thought insurmountable.|3|272|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We took courage, however, from despair, and what, by dint of cutting steps in the soft stone with our bowie knives, and swinging at the risk of our lives, to small projecting points of a harder species of slaty rock which now and then protruded from the general mass, we at length reached a natural platform, from which was perceptible a patch of blue sky, at the extremity of a thickly-wooded ravine.|4|272|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Looking back now, with somewhat more leisure, at the passage through which we had thus far proceeded, we clearly saw from the appearance of its sides, that it was of late formation, and we concluded that the concussion, whatever it was, which had so unexpectedly overwhelmed us, had also, at the same moment, laid open this path for escape.|5|272|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Being quite exhausted with exertion, and indeed, so weak that we were scarcely able to stand or articulate, Peters now proposed that we should endeavour to bring our companions to the rescue by firing the pistols which still remained in our girdles–the muskets as well as cutlasses had been lost among the loose earth at the bottom of the chasm.|6|272|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Subsequent events proved that, had we fired, we should have sorely repented it, but luckily a half suspicion of foul play had by this time arisen in my mind, and we forbore to let the savages know of our whereabouts.|7|272|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
After having reposed for about an hour, we pushed on slowly up the ravine, and had gone no great way before we heard a succession of tremendous yells.|0|273|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At length we reached what might be called the surface of the ground; for our path hitherto, since leaving the platform, had lain beneath an archway of high rock and foliage, at a vast distance overhead.|1|273|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
With great caution we stole to a narrow opening, through which we had a clear sight of the surrounding country, when the whole dreadful secret of the concussion broke upon us in one moment and at one view.|2|273|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The spot from which we looked was not far from the summit of the highest peak in the range of the soapstone hills.|0|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The gorge in which our party of thirty-two had entered ran within fifty feet to the left of us.|1|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But, for at least one hundred yards, the channel or bed of this gorge was entirely filled up with the chaotic ruins of more than a million tons of earth and stone that had been artificially tumbled within it.|2|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The means by which the vast mass had been precipitated were not more simple than evident, for sure traces of the murderous work were yet remaining.|3|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In several spots along the top of the eastern side of the gorge (we were now on the western) might be seen stakes of wood driven into the earth.|4|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In these spots the earth had not given way, but throughout the whole extent of the face of the precipice from which the mass had fAllan, it was clear, from marks left in the soil resembling those made by the drill of the rock blaster, that stakes similar to those we saw standing had been inserted, at not more than a yard apart, for the length of perhaps three hundred feet, and ranging at about ten feet back from the edge of the gulf.|5|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Strong cords of grape vine were attached to the stakes still remaining on the hill, and it was evident that such cords had also been attached to each of the other stakes.|6|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I have already spoken of the singular stratification of these soapstone hills; and the description just given of the narrow and deep fissure through which we effected our escape from inhumation will afford a further conception of its nature.|7|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This was such that almost every natural convulsion would be sure to split the soil into perpendicular layers or ridges running parallel with one another, and a very moderate exertion of art would be sufficient for effecting the same purpose.|8|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Of this stratification the savages had availed themselves to accomplish their treacherous ends.|9|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There can be no doubt that, by the continuous line of stakes, a partial rupture of the soil had been brought about probably to the depth of one or two feet, when by means of a savage pulling at the end of each of the cords (these cords being attached to the tops of the stakes, and extending back from the edge of the cliff), a vast leverage power was obtained, capable of hurling the whole face of the hill, upon a given signal, into the bosom of the abyss below.|10|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The fate of our poor companions was no longer a matter of uncertainty.|11|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We alone had escaped from the tempest of that overwhelming destruction.|12|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We were the only living white men upon the island.|13|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Our situation, as it now appeared, was scarcely less dreadful than when we had conceived ourselves entombed forever.|0|275|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We saw before us no prospect but that of being put to death by the savages, or of dragging out a miserable existence in captivity among them.|1|275|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We might, to be sure, conceal ourselves for a time from their observation among the fastnesses of the hills, and, as a final resort, in the chasm from which we had just issued; but we must either perish in the long polar winter through cold and famine, or be ultimately discovered in our efforts to obtain relief.|2|275|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The whole country around us seemed to be swarming with savages, crowds of whom, we now perceived, had come over from the islands to the southward on flat rafts, doubtless with a view of lending their aid in the capture and plunder of the Jane.|0|276|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The vessel still lay calmly at anchor in the bay, those on board being apparently quite unconscious of any danger awaiting them.|1|276|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
How we longed at that moment to be with them!|2|276|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
either to aid in effecting their escape, or to perish with them in attempting a defence.|3|276|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We saw no chance even of warning them of their danger without bringing immediate destruction upon our own heads, with but a remote hope of benefit to them.|4|276|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A pistol fired might suffice to apprise them that something wrong had occurred; but the report could not possibly inform them that their only prospect of safety lay in getting out of the harbour forthwith–nor tell them no principles of honour now bound them to remain, that their companions were no longer among the living.|5|276|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon hearing the discharge they could not be more thoroughly prepared to meet the foe, who were now getting ready to attack, than they already were, and always had been.|6|276|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
No good, therefore, and infinite harm, would result from our firing, and after mature deliberation, we forbore.|7|276|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Our next thought was to attempt to rush toward the vessel, to seize one of the four canoes which lay at the head of the bay, and endeavour to force a passage on board.|0|277|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But the utter impossibility of succeeding in this desperate task soon became evident.|1|277|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The country, as I said before, was literally swarming with the natives, skulking among the bushes and recesses of the hills, so as not to be observed from the schooner.|2|277|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In our immediate vicinity especially, and blockading the sole path by which we could hope to attain the shore at the proper point were stationed the whole party of the black skin warriors, with Too-wit at their head, and apparently only waiting for some re-enforcement to commence his onset upon the Jane.|3|277|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The canoes, too, which lay at the head of the bay, were manned with savages, unarmed, it is true, but who undoubtedly had arms within reach.|4|277|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We were forced, therefore, however unwillingly, to remain in our place of concealment, mere spectators of the conflict which presently ensued.|5|277|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In about half an hour we saw some sixty or seventy rafts, or flatboats, with outriggers, filled with savages, and coming round the southern bight of the harbor.|0|278|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They appeared to have no arms except short clubs, and stones which lay in the bottom of the rafts.|1|278|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Immediately afterward another detachment, still larger, appeared in an opposite direction, and with similar weapons.|2|278|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The four canoes, too, were now quickly filled with natives, starting up from the bushes at the head of the bay, and put off swiftly to join the other parties.|3|278|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Thus, in less time than I have taken to tell it, and as if by magic, the Jane saw herself surrounded by an immense multitude of desperadoes evidently bent upon capturing her at all hazards.|4|278|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
That they would succeed in so doing could not be doubted for an instant.|0|279|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The six men left in the vessel, however resolutely they might engage in her defence, were altogether unequal to the proper management of the guns, or in any manner to sustain a contest at such odds.|1|279|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I could hardly imagine that they would make resistance at all, but in this was deceived; for presently I saw them get springs upon the cable, and bring the vessel's starboard broadside to bear upon the canoes, which by this time were within pistol range, the rafts being nearly a quarter of a mile to windward.|2|279|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Owing to some cause unknown, but most probably to the agitation of our poor friends at seeing themselves in so hopeless a situation, the discharge was an entire failure.|3|279|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Not a canoe was hit or a single savage injured, the shots striking short and ricocheting over their heads.|4|279|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The only effect produced upon them was astonishment at the unexpected report and smoke, which was so excessive that for some moments I almost thought they would abandon their design entirely, and return to the shore.|5|279|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
And this they would most likely have done had our men followed up their broadside by a discharge of small arms, in which, as the canoes were now so near at hand, they could not have failed in doing some execution, sufficient, at least, to deter this party from a farther advance, until they could have given the rafts also a broadside.|6|279|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But, in place of this, they left the canoe party to recover from their panic, and, by looking about them, to see that no injury had been sustained, while they flew to the larboard to get ready for the rafts.|7|279|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The discharge to larboard produced the most terrible effect.|0|280|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The star and double-headed shot of the large guns cut seven or eight of the rafts completely asunder, and killed, perhaps, thirty or forty of the savages outright, while a hundred of them, at least, were thrown into the water, the most of them dreadfully wounded.|1|280|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The remainder, frightened out of their senses, commenced at once a precipitate retreat, not even waiting to pick up their maimed companions, who were swimming about in every direction, screaming and yelling for aid.|2|280|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This great success, however, came too late for the salvation of our devoted people.|3|280|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The canoe party were already on board the schooner to the number of more than a hundred and fifty, the most of them having succeeded in scrambling up the chains and over the boarding-netting even before the matches had been applied to the larboard guns.|4|280|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Nothing now could withstand their brute rage.|5|280|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Our men were borne down at once, overwhelmed, trodden under foot, and absolutely torn to pieces in an instant.|6|280|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Seeing this, the savages on the rafts got the better of their fears, and came up in shoals to the plunder.|0|281|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In five minutes the Jane was a pitiable scene indeed of havoc and tumultuous outrage.|1|281|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The decks were split open and ripped up; the cordage, sails, and everything movable on deck demolished as if by magic, while, by dint of pushing at the stern, towing with the canoes, and hauling at the sides, as they swam in thousands around the vessel, the wretches finally forced her on shore (the cable having been slipped), and delivered her over to the good offices of Too-wit, who, during the whole of the engagement, had maintained, like a skilful general, his post of security and reconnaissance among the hills, but, now that the victory was completed to his satisfaction, condescended to scamper down with his warriors of the black skin, and become a partaker in the spoils.|2|281|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Too-wit's descent left us at liberty to quit our hiding place and reconnoitre the hill in the vicinity of the chasm.|0|282|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At about fifty yards from the mouth of it we saw a small spring of water, at which we slaked the burning thirst that now consumed us.|1|282|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Not far from the spring we discovered several of the filbert-bushes which I mentioned before.|2|282|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon tasting the nuts we found them palatable, and very nearly resembling in flavour the common English filbert.|3|282|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We collected our hats full immediately, deposited them within the ravine, and returned for more.|4|282|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
While we were busily employed in gathering these, a rustling in the bushes alarmed us, and we were upon the point of stealing back to our covert, when a large black bird of the bittern species strugglingly and slowly arose above the shrubs.|5|282|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I was so much startled that I could do nothing, but Peters had sufficient presence of mind to run up to it before it could make its escape, and seize it by the neck.|6|282|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Its struggles and screams were tremendous, and we had thoughts of letting it go, lest the noise should alarm some of the savages who might be still lurking in the neighbourhood.|7|282|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A stab with a bowie knife, however, at length brought it to the ground, and we dragged it into the ravine, congratulating ourselves that, at all events, we had thus obtained a supply of food enough to last us for a week.|8|282|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We now went out again to look about us, and ventured a considerable distance down the southern declivity of the hill, but met with nothing else which could serve us for food.|0|283|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We therefore collected a quantity of dry wood and returned, seeing one or two large parties of the natives on their way to the village, laden with the plunder of the vessel, and who, we were apprehensive, might discover us in passing beneath the hill.|1|283|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Our next care was to render our place of concealment as secure as possible, and with this object, we arranged some brushwood over the aperture which I have before spoken of as the one through which we saw the patch of blue sky, on reaching the platform from the interior of the chasm.|0|284|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We left only a very small opening just wide enough to admit of our seeing the, bay, without the risk of being discovered from below.|1|284|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having done this, we congratulated ourselves upon the security of the position; for we were now completely excluded from observation, as long as we chose to remain within the ravine itself, and not venture out upon the hill, We could perceive no traces of the savages having ever been within this hollow; but, indeed, when we came to reflect upon the probability that the fissure through which we attained it had been only just now created by the fall of the cliff opposite, and that no other way of attaining it could be perceived, we were not so much rejoiced at the thought of being secure from molestation as fearful lest there should be absolutely no means left us for descent.|2|284|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We resolved to explore the summit of the hill thoroughly, when a good opportunity should offer.|3|284|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In the meantime we watched the motions of the savages through our loophole.|4|284|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They had already made a complete wreck of the vessel, and were now preparing to set her on fire.|0|285|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In a little while we saw the smoke ascending in huge volumes from her main hatchway, and, shortly afterward, a dense mass of flame burst up from the forecastle.|1|285|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The rigging, masts and what remained of the sails caught immediately, and the fire spread rapidly along the decks.|2|285|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Still a great many of the savages retained their stations about her, hammering with large stones, axes, and cannon balls at the bolts and other iron and copper work.|3|285|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the beach, and in canoes and rafts, there were not less, altogether, in the immediate vicinity of the schooner, than ten thousand natives, besides the shoals of them who, laden with booty, were making their way inland and over to the neighbouring islands.|4|285|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We now anticipated a catastrophe, and were not disappointed.|5|285|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
First of all there came a smart shock (which we felt as distinctly where we were as if we had been slightly galvanized), but unattended with any visible signs of an explosion.|6|285|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The savages were evidently startled, and paused for an instant from their labours and yellings.|7|285|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They were upon the point of recommencing, when suddenly a mass of smoke puffed up from the decks, resembling a black and heavy thundercloud–then, as if from its bowels, arose a tall stream of vivid fire to the height, apparently, of a quarter of a mile–then there came a sudden circular expansion of the flame–then the whole atmosphere was magically crowded, in a single instant, with a wild chaos of wood, and metal, and human limbs-and, lastly, came the concussion in its fullest fury, which hurled us impetuously from our feet, while the hills echoed and re-echoed the tumult, and a dense shower of the minutest fragments of the ruins tumbled headlong in every direction around us.|8|285|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The havoc among the savages far exceeded our utmost expectation, and they had now, indeed, reaped the full and perfect fruits of their treachery.|0|286|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Perhaps a thousand perished by the explosion, while at least an equal number were desperately mangled.|1|286|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The whole surface of the bay was literally strewn with the struggling and drowning wretches, and on shore matters were even worse.|2|286|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They seemed utterly appalled by the suddenness and completeness of their discomfiture, and made no efforts at assisting one another.|3|286|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At length we observed a total change in their demeanour.|4|286|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"From absolute stupor, they appeared to be, all at once, aroused to the highest pitch of excitement, and rushed wildly about, going to and from a certain point on the beach, with the strangest expressions of mingled horror, rage, and intense curiosity depicted on their countenances, and shouting, at the top of their voices, ""Tekeli-li!"|5|286|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"Tekeli-li""!"|6|286|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Presently we saw a large body go off into the hills, whence they returned in a short time, carrying stakes of wood.|0|287|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
These they brought to the station where the crowd was the thickest, which now separated so as to afford us a view of the object of all this excitement.|1|287|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We perceived something white lying upon the ground, but could not immediately make out what it was.|2|287|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At length we saw that it was the carcass of the strange animal with the scarlet teeth and claws which the schooner had picked up at sea on the eighteenth of January.|3|287|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Captain Guy had had the body preserved for the purpose of stuffing the skin and taking it to England.|4|287|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I remember he had given some directions about it just before our making the island, and it had been brought into the cabin and stowed away in one of the lockers.|5|287|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It had now been thrown on shore by the explosion; but why it had occasioned so much concern among the savages was more than we could comprehend.|6|287|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Although they crowded around the carcass at a little distance, none of them seemed willing to approach it closely.|7|287|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"By-and-by the men with the stakes drove them in a circle around it, and no sooner was this arrangement completed, than the whole of the vast assemblage rushed into the interior of the island, with loud screams of ""Tekeli-li!"|8|287|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"Tekeli-li""!"|9|287|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
During the six or seven days immediately following we remained in our hiding-place upon the hill, going out only occasionally, and then with the greatest precaution, for water and filberts.|0|288|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We had made a kind of penthouse on the platform, furnishing it with a bed of dry leaves, and placing in it three large flat stones, which served us for both fireplace and table.|1|288|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We kindled a fire without difficulty by rubbing two pieces of dry wood together, the one soft, the other hard.|2|288|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The bird we had taken in such good season proved excellent eating, although somewhat tough.|3|288|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was not an oceanic fowl, but a species of bittern, with jet black and grizzly plumage, and diminutive wings in proportion to its bulk.|4|288|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We afterward saw three of the same kind in the vicinity of the ravine, apparently seeking for the one we had captured; but, as they never alighted, we had no opportunity of catching them.|5|288|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As long as this fowl lasted we suffered nothing from our situation, but it was now entirely consumed, and it became absolutely necessary that we should look out for provision.|0|289|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The filberts would not satisfy the cravings of hunger, afflicting us, too, with severe gripings of the bowels, and, if freely indulged in, with violent headache.|1|289|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We had seen several large tortoises near the seashore to the eastward of the hill, and perceived they might be easily taken, if we could get at them without the observation of the natives.|2|289|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was resolved, therefore, to make an attempt at descending.|3|289|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We commenced by going down the southern declivity, which seemed to offer the fewest difficulties, but had not proceeded a hundred yards before (as we had anticipated from appearances on the hilltop) our progress was entirely arrested by a branch of the gorge in which our companions had perished.|0|290|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We now passed along the edge of this for about a quarter of a mile, when we were again stopped by a precipice of immense depth, and, not being able to make our way along the brink of it, we were forced to retrace our steps by the main ravine.|1|290|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We now pushed over to the eastward, but with precisely similar fortune.|0|291|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
After an hour's scramble, at the risk of breaking our necks, we discovered that we had merely descended into a vast pit of black granite, with fine dust at the bottom, and whence the only egress was by the rugged path in which we had come down.|1|291|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Toiling again up this path, we now tried the northern edge of the hill.|2|291|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Here we were obliged to use the greatest possible caution in our manoeuvres, as the least indiscretion would expose us to the full view of the savages in the village.|3|291|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We crawled along, therefore, on our hands and knees, and, occasionally, were even forced to throw ourselves at full length, dragging our bodies along by means of the shrubbery.|4|291|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In this careful manner we had proceeded but a little way, when we arrived at a chasm far deeper than any we had yet seen, and leading directly into the main gorge.|5|291|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Thus our fears were fully confirmed, and we found ourselves cut off entirely from access to the world below.|6|291|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Thoroughly exhausted by our exertions, we made the best of our way back to the platform, and throwing ourselves upon the bed of leaves, slept sweetly and soundly for some hours.|7|291|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For several days after this fruitless search we were occupied in exploring every part of the summit of the hill, in order to inform ourselves of its actual resources.|0|292|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We found that it would afford us no food, with the exception of the unwholesome filberts, and a rank species of scurvy grass, which grew in a little patch of not more than four rods square, and would be soon exhausted.|1|292|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the fifteenth of February, as near as I can remember, there was not a blade of this left, and the nuts were growing scarce; our situation, therefore, could hardly be more lamentable.|2|292|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
* On the sixteenth we again went round the walls of our prison, in hope of finding some avenue of escape; but to no purpose.|3|292|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We also descended the chasm in which we had been overwhelmed, with the faint expectation of discovering, through this channel, some opening to the main ravine.|4|292|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Here, too, we were disappointed, although we found and brought up with us a musket.|5|292|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
* This day was rendered remarkable by our observing in the south several huge wreaths of the grayish vapour I have spoken of.|0|293|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the seventeenth we set out with the determination of examining more thoroughly the chasm of black granite into which we had made our way in the first search.|0|294|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We remembered that one of the fissures in the sides of this pit had been but partially looked into, and we were anxious to explore it, although with no expectation of discovering here any opening.|1|294|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We found no great difficulty in reaching the bottom of the hollow as before, and were now sufficiently calm to survey it with some attention.|0|295|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was, indeed, one of the most singular-looking places imaginable, and we could scarcely bring ourselves to believe it altogether the work of nature.|1|295|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The pit, from its eastern to its western extremity, was about five hundred yards in length, when all its windings were threaded; the distance from east to west in a straight line not being more (I should suppose, having no means of accurate examination) than forty or fifty yards.|2|295|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon first descending into the chasm, that is to say, for a hundred feet downward from the summit of the hill, the sides of the abyss bore little resemblance to each other, and, apparently, had at no time been connected, the one surface being of the soapstone, and the other of marl, granulated with some metallic matter.|3|295|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The average breadth or interval between the two cliffs was probably here sixty feet, but there seemed to be no regularity of formation.|4|295|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Passing down, however, beyond the limit spoken of, the interval rapidly contracted, and the sides began to run parallel, although, for some distance farther, they were still dissimilar in their material and form of surface.|5|295|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon arriving within fifty feet of the bottom, a perfect regularity commenced.|6|295|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The sides were now entirely uniform in substance, in colour, and in lateral direction, the material being a very black and shining granite, and the distance between the two sides, at all points facing each other, exactly twenty yards.|7|295|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The precise formation of the chasm will be best understood by means of a delineation taken upon the spot; for I had luckily with me a pocketbook and pencil, which I preserved with great care through a long series of subsequent adventure, and to which I am indebted for memoranda of many subjects which would otherwise have been crowded from my remembrance.|8|295|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This figure (see fig.|0|296|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
1) gives the general outlines of the chasm, without the minor cavities in the sides, of which there were several, each cavity having a corresponding protuberance opposite.|1|296|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The bottom of the gulf was covered to the depth of three or four inches with a powder almost impalpable, beneath which we found a continuation of the black granite.|2|296|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To the right, at the lower extremity, will be noticed the appearance of a small opening; this is the fissure alluded to above, and to examine which more minutely than before was the object of our second visit.|3|296|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We now pushed into it with vigor, cutting away a quantity of brambles which impeded us, and removing a vast heap of sharp flints somewhat resembling arrowheads in shape.|4|296|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We were encouraged to persevere, however, by perceiving some little light proceeding from the farther end.|5|296|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We at length squeezed our way for about thirty feet, and found that the aperture was a low and regularly formed arch, having a bottom of the same impalpable powder as that in the main chasm.|6|296|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A strong light now broke upon us, and, turning a short bend, we found ourselves in another lofty chamber, similar to the one we had left in every respect but longitudinal form.|7|296|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Its general figure is here given.|8|296|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax

2.|10|296|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The total length of this chasm, commencing at the opening a and proceeding round the curve b to the extremity d, is five hundred and fifty yards.|0|297|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At c we discovered a small aperture similar to the one through which we had issued from the other chasm, and this was choked up in the same manner with brambles and a quantity of the white arrowhead flints.|1|297|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We forced our way through it, finding it about forty feet long, and emerged into a third chasm.|2|297|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This, too, was precisely like the first, except in its longitudinal shape, which was thus.|3|297|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
(See fig.|4|297|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
3.|5|297|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We found the entire length of the third chasm three hundred and twenty yards.|0|298|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At the point a was an opening about six feet wide, and extending fifteen feet into the rock, where it terminated in a bed of marl, there being no other chasm beyond, as we had expected.|1|298|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We were about leaving this fissure, into which very little light was admitted, when Peters called my attention to a range of singular-looking indentures in the surface of the marl forming the termination of the cul-de-sac.|2|298|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
With a very slight exertion of the imagination, the left, or most northern of these indentures might have been taken for the intentional, although rude, representation of a human figure standing erect, with outstretched arm.|3|298|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The rest of them bore also some little resemblance to alphabetical characters, and Peters was willing, at all events, to adopt the idle opinion that they were really such.|4|298|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I convinced him of his error, finally, by directing his attention to the floor of the fissure, where, among the powder, we picked up, piece by piece, several large flakes of the marl, which had evidently been broken off by some convulsion from the surface where the indentures were found, and which had projecting points exactly fitting the indentures; thus proving them to have been the work of nature.|5|298|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Fig.|6|298|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
4 presents an accurate copy of the whole.|7|298|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
After satisfying ourselves that these singular caverns afforded us no means of escape from our prison, we made our way back, dejected and dispirited, to the summit of the hill.|0|299|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Nothing worth mentioning occurred during the next twenty-four hours, except that, in examining the ground to the eastward of the third chasm, we found two triangular holes of great depth, and also with black granite sides.|1|299|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Into these holes we did not think it worth while to attempt descending, as they had the appearance of mere natural wells, without outlet.|2|299|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They were each about twenty yards in circumference, and their shape, as well as relative position in regard to the third chasm, is shown in figure 5.|3|299|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On the twentieth of the month, finding it altogether impossible to subsist any longer upon the filberts, the use of which occasioned us the most excruciating torment, we resolved to make a desperate attempt at descending the southern declivity of the hill.|0|300|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The face of the precipice was here of the softest species of soapstone, although nearly perpendicular throughout its whole extent (a depth of a hundred and fifty feet at the least), and in many places even overarching.|1|300|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
After long search we discovered a narrow ledge about twenty feet below the brink of the gulf; upon this Peters contrived to leap, with what assistance I could render him by means of our pocket-handkerchiefs tied together.|2|300|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
With somewhat more difficulty I also got down; and we then saw the possibility of descending the whole way by the process in which we had clambered up from the chasm when we had been buried by the fall of the hill–that is, by cutting steps in the face of the soapstone with our knives.|3|300|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The extreme hazard of the attempt can scarcely be conceived; but, as there was no other resource, we determined to undertake it.|4|300|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Upon the ledge where we stood there grew some filbert bushes; and to one of these we made fast an end of our rope of handkerchiefs.|0|301|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The other end being tied round Peters' waist, I lowered him down over the edge of the precipice until the handkerchiefs were stretched tight.|1|301|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He now proceeded to dig a deep hole in the soapstone (as far in as eight or ten inches), sloping away the rock above to the height of a foot, or thereabout, so as to allow of his driving, with the butt of a pistol, a tolerably strong peg into the levelled surface.|2|301|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I then drew him up for about four feet when he made a hole similar to the one below, driving in a peg as before and having thus a resting place for both feet and hands.|3|301|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I now unfastened the handkerchiefs from the bush, throwing him the end, which he tied to the peg in the uppermost hole, letting himself down gently to a station about three feet lower than he had yet been–that is, to the full extent of the handkerchiefs.|4|301|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Here he dug another hole, and drove another peg.|5|301|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He then drew himself up, so as to rest his feet in the hole just cut, taking hold with his hands upon the peg in the one above.|6|301|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was now necessary to untie the handkerchiefs from the topmost peg, with the view of fastening them to the second; and here he found that an error had been committed in cutting the holes at so great a distance apart.|7|301|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
However, after one or two unsuccessful and dangerous attempts at reaching the knot (having to hold on with his left hand while he laboured to undo the fastening with his right), he at length cut the string, leaving six inches of it affixed to the peg.|8|301|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Tying the handkerchiefs now to the second peg, he descended to a station below the third, taking care not to go too far down.|9|301|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
By these means (means which I should never have conceived of myself, and for which we were indebted altogether to Peters' ingenuity and resolution) my companion finally succeeded, with the occasional aid of projections in the cliff, in reaching the bottom without accident.|10|301|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was some time before I could summon sufficient resolution to follow him; but I did at length attempt it.|0|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peters had taken off his shirt before descending, and this, with my own, formed the rope necessary for the adventure.|1|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
After throwing down the musket found in the chasm, I fastened this rope to the bushes, and let myself down rapidly, striving, by the vigour of my movements, to banish the trepidation which I could overcome in no other manner.|2|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This answered sufficiently well for the first four or five steps; but presently I found my imagination growing terribly excited by thoughts of the vast depths yet to be descended, and the precarious nature of the pegs and soapstone holes which were my only support.|3|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was in vain I endeavoured to banish these reflections, and to keep my eyes steadily bent upon the flat surface of the cliff before me.|4|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The more earnestly I struggled not to think, the more intensely vivid became my conceptions, and the more horribly distinct.|5|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At length arrived that crisis of fancy, so fearful in all similar cases, the crisis in which we begin to anticipate the feelings with which we shall fall- to picture to ourselves the sickness, and dizziness, and the last struggle, and the half swoon, and the final bitterness of the rushing and headlong descent.|6|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
And now I found these fancies creating their own realities, and all imagined horrors crowding upon me in fact.|7|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I felt my knees strike violently together, while my fingers were gradually but certainly relaxing their grasp.|8|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"There was a ringing in my ears, and I said, ""This is my knell of death""!"|9|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
And now I was consumed with the irrepressible desire of looking below.|10|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I could not, I would not, confine my glances to the cliff; and, with a wild, indefinable emotion, half of horror, half of a relieved oppression, I threw my vision far down into the abyss.|11|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
For one moment my fingers clutched convulsively upon their hold, while, with the movement, the faintest possible idea of ultimate escape wandered, like a shadow, through my mind–in the next my whole soul was pervaded with a longing to fall; a desire, a yearning, a passion utterly uncontrollable.|12|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I let go at once my grasp upon the and, turning half round from the precipice, remained tottering for an instant against its naked face.|13|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But now there came a spinning of the brain; a shrill-sounding and phantom voice screamed within my ears; a dusky, fiendish, and filmy figure stood immediately beneath me; and, sighing, I sunk down with a bursting heart, and plunged within its arms.|14|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I had swooned, and Peters had caught me as I fell.|0|303|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He had observed my proceedings from his station at the bottom of the cliff; and perceiving my imminent danger, had endeavoured to inspire me with courage by every suggestion he could devise; although my confusion of mind had been so great as to prevent my hearing what he said, or being conscious that he had even spoken to me at all.|1|303|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At length, seeing me totter, he hastened to ascend to my rescue, and arrived just in time for my preservation.|2|303|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Had I fAllan with my full weight, the rope of linen would inevitably have snapped, and I should have been precipitated into the abyss; as it was, he contrived to let me down gently, so as to remain suspended without danger until animation returned.|3|303|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This was in about fifteen minutes.|4|303|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On recovery, my trepidation had entirely vanished; I felt a new being, and, with some little further aid from my companion, reached the bottom also in safety.|5|303|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We now found ourselves not far from the ravine which had proved the tomb of our friends, and to the southward of the spot where the hill had fAllan.|0|304|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The place was one of singular wildness, and its aspect brought to my mind the descriptions given by travellers of those dreary regions marking the site of degraded Babylon.|1|304|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Not to speak of the ruins of the disrupted cliff, which formed a chaotic barrier in the vista to the northward, the surface of the ground in every other direction was strewn with huge tumuli, apparently the wreck of some gigantic structures of art; although, in detail, no semblance of art could be detected.|2|304|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Scoria were abundant, and large shapeless blocks of the black granite, intermingled with others of marl,* and both granulated with metal.|3|304|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Of vegetation there were no traces whatsoever throughout the whole of the desolate area within sight.|4|304|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Several immense scorpions were seen, and various reptiles not elsewhere to be found in the high latitudes.|5|304|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
* The marl was also black; indeed, we noticed no light-coloured substances of any kind upon the island.|0|305|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As food was our most immediate object, we resolved to make our way to the seacoast, distant not more than half a mile, with a view of catching turtle, several of which we had observed from our place of concealment on the hill.|0|306|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We had proceeded some hundred yards, threading our route cautiously between the huge rocks and tumuli, when, upon turning a corner, five savages sprung upon us from a small cavern, felling Peters to the ground with a blow from a club.|1|306|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As he fell the whole party rushed upon him to secure their victim, leaving me time to recover from my astonishment.|2|306|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I still had the musket, but the barrel had received so much injury in being thrown from the precipice that I cast it aside as useless, preferring to trust my pistols, which had been carefully preserved in order.|3|306|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
With these I advanced upon the assailants, firing one after the other in quick succession.|4|306|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Two savages fell, and one, who was in the act of thrusting a spear into Peters, sprung to his feet without accomplishing his purpose.|5|306|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
My companion being thus released, we had no further difficulty.|6|306|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He had his pistols also, but prudently declined using them, confiding in his great personal strength, which far exceeded that of any person I have ever known.|7|306|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Seizing a club from one of the savages who had fAllan, he dashed out the brains of the three who remained, killing each instantaneously with a single blow of the weapon, and leaving us completely masters of the field.|8|306|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
So rapidly had these events passed, that we could scarcely believe in their reality, and were standing over the bodies of the dead in a species of stupid contemplation, when we were brought to recollection by the sound of shouts in the distance.|0|307|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was clear that the savages had been alarmed by the firing, and that we had little chance of avoiding discovery.|1|307|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To regain the cliff, it would be necessary to proceed in the direction of the shouts; and even should we succeed in arriving at its base, we should never be able to ascend it without being seen.|2|307|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Our situation was one of the greatest peril, and we were hesitating in which path to commence a flight, when one of the savages whom I had shot, and supposed dead, sprang briskly to his feet, and attempted to make his escape.|3|307|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We overtook him, however, before he had advanced many paces, and were about to put him to death, when Peters suggested that we might derive some benefit from forcing him to accompany us in our attempt to escape.|4|307|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We therefore dragged him with us, making him understand that we would shoot him if he offered resistance.|5|307|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In a few minutes he was perfectly submissive, and ran by our sides as we pushed in among the rocks, making for the seashore.|6|307|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
So far, the irregularities of the ground we had been traversing hid the sea, except at intervals, from our sight, and, when we first had it fairly in view, it was perhaps, two hundred yards distant.|0|308|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As we emerged into the open beach we saw, to our great dismay, an immense crowd of the natives pouring from the village, and from all visible quarters of the island, making toward us with gesticulations of extreme fury, and howling like wild beasts.|1|308|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We were upon the point of turning upon our steps, and trying to secure a retreat among the fastnesses of the rougher ground, when I discovered the bows of two canoes projecting from behind a large rock which ran out into the water.|2|308|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Toward these we now ran with all speed, and, reaching them, found them unguarded, and without any other freight than three of the large Gallipago turtles and the usual supply of paddles for sixty rowers.|3|308|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We instantly took possession of one of them, and, forcing our captive on board, pushed out to sea with an the strength we could command.|4|308|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We had not made, however, more than fifty yards from the shore before we became sufficiently calm to perceive the great oversight of which we had been guilty in leaving the other canoe in the power of the savages, who, by this time, were not more than twice as far from the beach as ourselves, and were rapidly advancing to the pursuit.|0|309|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
No time was now to be lost.|1|309|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Our hope was, at best, a forlorn one, but we had none other.|2|309|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was very doubtful whether, with the utmost exertion, we could get back in time to anticipate them in taking possession of the canoe; but yet there was a chance that we could.|3|309|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We might save ourselves if we succeeded, while not to make the attempt was to resign ourselves to inevitable butchery.|4|309|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The canoe was modelled with the bow and stern alike, and, in place of turning it round, we merely changed our position in paddling.|0|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
As soon as the savages perceived this they redoubled their yells, as well as their speed, and approached with inconceivable rapidity.|1|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We pulled, however, with all the energy of desperation, and arrived at the contested point before more than one of the natives had attained it.|2|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This man paid dearly for his superior agility, Peters shooting him through the head with a pistol as he approached the shore.|3|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The foremost among the rest of his party were probably some twenty or thirty paces distant as we seized upon the canoe.|4|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We at first endeavoured to pull her into the deep water, beyond the reach of the savages, but, finding her too firmly aground, and there being no time to spare, Peters, with one or two heavy strokes from the butt of the musket, succeeded in dashing out a large portion of the bow and of one side.|5|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We then pushed off.|6|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Two of the natives by this time had got hold of our boat, obstinately refusing to let go, until we were forced to despatch them with our knives.|7|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We were now clear off, and making great way out to sea.|8|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The main body of the savages, upon reaching the broken canoe, set up the most tremendous yell of rage and disappointment conceivable.|9|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In truth, from every thing I could see of these wretches, they appeared to be the most wicked, hypocritical, vindictive, bloodthirsty, and altogether fiendish race of men upon the face of the globe.|10|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It is clear we should have had no mercy had we fAllan into their hands.|11|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They made a mad attempt at following us in the fractured canoe, but, finding it useless, again vented their rage in a series of hideous vociferations, and rushed up into the hills.|12|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We were thus relieved from immediate danger, but our situation was still sufficiently gloomy.|0|311|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We knew that four canoes of the kind we had were at one time in the possession of the savages, and were not aware of the fact (afterward ascertained from our captive) that two of these had been blown to pieces in the explosion of the Jane Guy.|1|311|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We calculated, therefore, upon being yet pursued, as soon as our enemies could get round to the bay (distant about three miles) where the boats were usually laid up.|2|311|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Fearing this, we made every exertion to leave the island behind us, and went rapidly through the water, forcing the prisoner to take a paddle.|3|311|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In about half an hour, when we had gained, probably, five or six miles to the southward, a large fleet of the flat-bottomed canoes or rafts were seen to emerge from the bay evidently with the design of pursuit.|4|311|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Presently they put back, despairing to overtake us.|5|311|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We now found ourselves in the wide and desolate Antarctic Ocean, in a latitude exceeding eighty-four degrees, in a frail canoe, and with no provision but the three turtles.|0|313|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The long polar winter, too, could not be considered as far distant, and it became necessary that we should deliberate well upon the course to be pursued.|1|313|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
There were six or seven islands in sight belonging to the same group, and distant from each other about five or six leagues; but upon neither of these had we any intention to venture.|2|313|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In coming from the northward in the Jane Guy we had been gradually leaving behind us the severest regions of ice–this, however little it may be in accordance with the generally received notions respecting the Antarctic, was a fact experience would not permit us to deny.|3|313|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To attempt, therefore, getting back would be folly–especially at so late a period of the season.|4|313|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Only one course seemed to be left open for hope.|5|313|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We resolved to steer boldly to the southward, where there was at least a probability of discovering lands, and more than a probability of finding a still milder climate.|6|313|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
So far we had found the Antarctic, like the Arctic Ocean, peculiarly free from violent storms or immoderately rough water, but our canoe was, at best, of frail structure, although large, and we set busily to work with a view of rendering her as safe as the limited means in our possession would admit.|0|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The body of the boat was of no better material than bark–the bark of a tree unknown.|1|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The ribs were of a tough osier, well adapted to the purpose for which it was used.|2|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We had fifty feet room from stern to stern, from four to six in breadth, and in depth throughout four feet and a half–the boats thus differing vastly in shape from those of any other inhabitants of the Southern Ocean with whom civilized nations are acquainted.|3|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We never did believe them the workmanship of the ignorant islanders who owned them; and some days after this period discovered, by questioning our captive, that they were in fact made by the natives of a group to the southwest of the country where we found them, having fAllan accidentally into the hands of our barbarians.|4|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
What we could do for the security of our boat was very little indeed.|5|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Several wide rents were discovered near both ends, and these we contrived to patch up with pieces of woollen jacket.|6|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
With the help of the superfluous paddles, of which there were a great many, we erected a kind of framework about the bow, so as to break the force of any seas which might threaten to fill us in that quarter.|7|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We also set up two paddle blades for masts, placing them opposite each other, one by each gunwale, thus saving the necessity of a yard.|8|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To these masts we attached a sail made of our shirts–doing this with some difficulty, as here we could get no assistance from our prisoner whatever, although he had been willing enough to labour in all the other operations.|9|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The sight of the linen seemed to affect him in a very singular manner.|10|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"He could not be prevailed upon to touch it or go near it, shuddering when we attempted to force him, and shrieking out, ""Tekeli-li""!"|11|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having completed our arrangements in regard to the security of the canoe, we now set sail to the south southeast for the present, with the view of weathering the most southerly of the group in sight.|0|315|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This being done, we turned the bow full to the southward.|1|315|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The weather could by no means be considered disagreeable.|2|315|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We had a prevailing and very gentle wind from the northward, a smooth sea, and continual daylight.|3|315|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
No ice whatever was to be seen; nor did I ever see one particle of this after leaving the parallel of Bennet's Islet.|4|315|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Indeed, the temperature of the water was here far too warm for its existence in any quantity.|5|315|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Having killed the largest of our tortoises, and obtained from him not only food but a copious supply of water, we continued on our course, without any incident of moment, for perhaps seven or eight days, during which period we must have proceeded a vast distance to the southward, as the wind blew constantly with us, and a very strong current set continually in the direction we were pursuing.|6|315|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
March 1.|0|316|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
*–Many unusual phenomena now indicated that we were entering upon a region of novelty and wonder.|1|316|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A high range of light gray vapour appeared constantly in the southern horizon, flaring up occasionally in lofty streaks, now darting from east to west, now from west to east, and again presenting a level and uniform summit–in short, having all the wild variations of the Aurora Borealis.|2|316|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The average height of this vapour, as apparent from our station, was about twenty-five degrees.|3|316|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The temperature of the sea seemed to be increasing momentarily, and there was a very perceptible alteration in its colour.|4|316|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
* For obvious reasons I cannot pretend to strict accuracy in these dates.|0|317|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They are given principally with a view to perspicuity of narration, and as set down in my pencil memorandum.|1|317|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
March 2.|0|318|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
–To-day by repeated questioning of our captive, we came to the knowledge of many particulars in regard to the island of the massacre, its inhabitants, and customs–but with these how can I now detain the reader?|1|318|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I may say, however, that we learned there were eight islands in the group–that they were governed by a common king, named Tsalemon or Psalemoun, who resided in one of the smallest of the islands; that the black skins forming the dress of the warriors came from an animal of huge size to be found only in a valley near the court of the king–that the inhabitants of the group fabricated no other boats than the flat-bottomed rafts; the four canoes being all of the kind in their possession, and these having been obtained, by mere accident, from some large island in the southwest–that his own name was Nu-Nu–that he had no knowledge of Bennet's Islet–and that the appellation of the island he had left was Tsalal.|2|318|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The commencement of the words Tsalemon and Tsalal was given with a prolonged hissing sound, which we found it impossible to imitate, even after repeated endeavours, and which was precisely the same with the note of the black bittern we had eaten up on the summit of the hill.|3|318|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax

–The heat of the water was now truly remarkable, and in colour was undergoing a rapid change, being no longer transparent, but of a milky consistency and hue.|1|319|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
In our immediate vicinity it was usually smooth, never so rough as to endanger the canoe–but we were frequently surprised at perceiving, to our right and left, at different distances, sudden and extensive agitations of the surface–these, we at length noticed, were always preceded by wild flickerings in the region of vapour to the southward.|2|319|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax

Nu-Nu was seated at my elbow, and the linen accidentally flaring in his face, he became violently affected with convulsions.|2|320|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax

–The wind had entirely ceased, but it was evident that we were still hurrying on to the southward, under the influence of a powerful current.|1|321|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
And now, indeed, it would seem reasonable that we should experience some alarm at the turn events were taking–but we felt none.|2|321|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The countenance of Peters indicated nothing of this nature, although it wore at times an expression I could not fathom.|3|321|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The polar winter appeared to be coming on–but coming without its terrors.|4|321|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax

–The gray vapour had now arisen many more degrees above the horizon, and was gradually losing its grayness of tint.|1|322|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The heat of the water was extreme, even unpleasant to the touch, and its milky hue was more evident than ever.|2|322|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
To-day a violent agitation of the water occurred very close to the canoe.|3|322|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It was attended, as usual, with a wild flaring up of the vapour at its summit, and a momentary division at its base.|4|322|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
A fine white powder, resembling ashes–but certainly not such–fell over the canoe and over a large surface of the water, as the flickering died away among the vapour and the commotion subsided in the sea.|5|322|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Nu-Nu now threw himself on his face in the bottom of the boat, and no persuasions could induce him to arise.|6|322|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax

–This day we questioned Nu-Nu concerning the motives of his countrymen in destroying our companions; but he appeared to be too utterly overcome by terror to afford us any rational reply.|1|323|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He still obstinately lay in the bottom of the boat; and, upon reiterating the questions as to the motive, made use only of idiotic gesticulations, such as raising with his forefinger the upper lip, and displaying the teeth which lay beneath it.|2|323|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
These were black.|3|323|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax

I would have picked it up, but there came over me a sudden listlessness, and I forbore.|2|324|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The heat of the water still increased, and the hand could no longer be endured within it.|3|324|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peters spoke little, and I knew not what to think of his apathy.|4|324|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax

–The whole ashy material fell now continually around us, and in vast quantities.|1|325|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The range of vapour to the southward had arisen prodigiously in the horizon, and began to assume more distinctness of form.|2|325|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
I can liken it to nothing but a limitless cataract, rolling silently into the sea from some immense and far-distant rampart in the heaven, The gigantic curtain ranged along the whole extent of the southern horizon.|3|325|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It emitted no sound.|4|325|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax

We were nearly overwhelmed by the white ashy shower which settled upon us and upon the canoe, but melted into the water as it fell.|2|326|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The summit of the cataract was utterly lost in the dimness and the distance.|3|326|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Yet we were evidently approaching it with a hideous velocity.|4|326|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
At intervals there were visible in it wide, yawning, but momentary rents, and from out these rents, within which was a chaos of flitting and indistinct images, there came rushing and mighty, but soundless winds, tearing up the enkindled ocean in their course.|5|326|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
March 22.|0|327|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax

Many gigantic and pallidly white birds flew continuously now from beyond the veil, and their scream was the eternal Tekeli-li!|2|327|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
as they retreated from our vision.|3|327|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Hereupon Nu-Nu stirred in the bottom of the boat; but upon touching him, we found his spirit departed.|4|327|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
And now we rushed into the embraces of the cataract, where a chasm threw itself open to receive us.|5|327|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But there arose in our pathway a shrouded human figure, very far larger in its proportions than any dweller among men.|6|327|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
And the hue of the skin of the figure was of the perfect whiteness of the snow.|7|327|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The circumstances connected with the late sudden and distressing death of Mr. Pym are already well known to the public through the medium of the daily press.|0|329|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
It is feared that the few remaining chapters which were to have completed his narrative, and which were retained by him, while the above were in type, for the purpose of revision, have been irrecoverably lost through the accident by which he perished himself.|1|329|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This, however, may prove not to be the case, and the papers, if ultimately found, will be given to the public.|2|329|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
No means have been left untried to remedy the deficiency.|0|330|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The gentleman whose name is mentioned in the preface, and who, from the statement there made, might be supposed able to fill the vacuum, has declined the task–this for satisfactory reasons connected with the general inaccuracy of the details afforded him, and his disbelief in the entire truth of the latter portions of the narration.|1|330|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Peters, from whom some information might be expected, is still alive, and a resident of Illinois, but cannot be met with at present.|2|330|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
He may hereafter be found, and will, no doubt, afford material for a conclusion of Mr. Pym's account.|3|330|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The loss of the two or three final chapters (for there were but two or three) is the more deeply to be regretted, as, it cannot be doubted, they contained matter relative to the Pole itself, or at least to regions in its very near proximity; and as, too, the statements of the author in relation to these regions may shortly be verified or contradicted by means of the governmental expedition now preparing for the Southern Ocean.|0|331|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
On one point in the Narrative some remarks may be well offered; and it would afford the writer of this appendix much pleasure if what he may here observe should have a tendency to throw credit, in any degree, upon the very singular pages now published.|0|332|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
We allude to the chasms found in the island of Tsalal, and to the whole of the figures presented in Chapter XXIII.|1|332|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Mr. Pym has given the figures of the chasm without comment, and speaks decidedly of the indentures found at the extremity of the most easterly of these chasms as having but a fanciful resemblance to alphabetical characters, and, in short, as being positively not such.|0|333|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This assertion is made in a manner so simple, and sustained by a species of demonstration so conclusive (viz.|1|333|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
, the fitting of the projections of the fragments found among the dust into the indentures upon the wall), that we are forced to believe the writer in earnest; and no reasonable reader should suppose otherwise.|2|333|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
But as the facts in relation to all the figures are most singular (especially when taken in connexion with statements made in the body of the narrative), it may be as well to say a word or two concerning them all–this, too, the more especially as the facts in question have, beyond doubt, escaped the attention of Mr. Poe.|3|333|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"Figure 1, then figure 2, figure 3, and figure 5, when conjoined with one another in the precise order which the chasms themselves presented, and when deprived of the small lateral branches or arches (which, it will be remembered, served only as means of communication between the main chambers, and were of totally distinct character), constitute an Ethiopian verbal root–the root (SEE ILLUSTRATION) ""To be shady""–whence all the inflections of shadow or darkness."|0|334|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"In regard to the ""left or most northwardly"" of the indentures in figure 4, it is more than probable that the opinion of Peters was correct, and that the hieroglyphical appearance was really the work of art, and intended as the representation of a human form."|0|335|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The delineation is before the reader, and he may, or may not, perceive the resemblance suggested; but the rest of the indentures afford strong confirmation of Peters' idea.|1|335|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"The upper range is evidently the Arabic verbal root (SEE ILLUSTRATION) ""To be white,"" whence all the inflections of brilliancy and whiteness."|2|335|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The lower range is not so immediately perspicuous.|3|335|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"The characters are somewhat broken and disjointed; nevertheless, it cannot be doubted that, in their perfect state, they formed the full Egyptian word (SEE ILLUSTRATION), ""The region of the south""."|4|335|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"It should be observed that these interpretations confirm the opinion of Peters in regard to the ""most northwardly"" of the figures."|5|335|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
The arm is outstretched towards the south.|6|335|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Conclusions such as these open a wide field for speculation and exciting conjecture.|0|336|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
They should be regarded, perhaps, in connexion with some of the most faintly-detailed incidents of the narrative; although in no visible manner is this chain of connexion complete.|1|336|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Tekeli-li!|2|336|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
was the cry of the affrighted natives of Tsalal upon discovering the carcass of the white animal picked up at sea.|3|336|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This also was the shuddering exclamation of the captive Tsalalian upon encountering the white materials in possession of Mr. Pym.|4|336|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
This also was the shriek of the swift-flying, white, and gigantic birds which issued from the vapoury white curtain of the South.|5|336|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
Nothing white was to be found at Tsalal, and nothing otherwise in the subsequent voyage to the region beyond.|6|336|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax
"It is not impossible that ""Tsalal,"" the appellation of the island of the chasms, may be found, upon minute philological scrutiny, to betray either some alliance with the chasms themselves, or some reference to the Ethiopian characters so mysteriously written in their windings."|7|336|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|February 1837|Adventure / Hoax

In getting my books, I have been always solicitous of an ample margin; this not so much through any love of the thing in itself, however agreeable, as for the facility it affords me of pencilling suggested thoughts, agreements, and differences of opinion, or brief critical comments in general.|0|1|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Where what I have to note is too much to be included within the narrow limits of a margin, I commit it to a slip of paper, and deposit it between the leaves; taking care to secure it by an imperceptible portion of gum tragacanth paste.|1|1|Marginalia|1846|Essay
All this may be whim; it may be not only a very hackneyed, but a very idle practice;–yet I persist in it still; and it affords me pleasure; which is profit, in despite of Mr. Bentham, with Mr. Mill on his back.|0|2|Marginalia|1846|Essay
"This making of notes, however, is by no means the making of mere memorandum–a custom which has its disadvantages, beyond doubt ""Ce que je mets sur papier,"" says Bernadine de St. Pierre, ""je remets de ma memoire et par consequence je l'oublie;""–and, in fact, if you wish to forget anything upon the spot, make a note that this thing is to be remembered."|0|3|Marginalia|1846|Essay
But the purely marginal jottings, done with no eye to the Memorandum Book, have a distinct complexion, and not only a distinct purpose, but none at all; this it is which imparts to them a value.|0|4|Marginalia|1846|Essay
"They have a rank somewhat above the chance and desultory comments of literary chit-chat–for these latter are not unfrequently ""talk for talk's sake,"" hurried out of the mouth; while the marginalia are deliberately pencilled, because the mind of the reader wishes to unburthen itself of a thought;–however flippant–however silly–however trivial–still a thought indeed, not merely a thing that might have been a thought in time, and under more favorable circumstances."|1|4|Marginalia|1846|Essay
In the marginalia, too, we talk only to ourselves; we therefore talk freshly–boldly- originally–with abandonnement–without conceit–much after the fashion of Jeremy Taylor, and Sir Thomas Browne, and Sir William Temple, and the anatomical Burton, and that most logical analogist, Butler, and some other people of the old day, who were too full of their matter to have any room for their manner, which, being thus left out of question, was a capital manner, indeed,–a model of manners, with a richly marginalic air.|2|4|Marginalia|1846|Essay

"It compels us (whatever diffuseness of idea we may clandestinely entertain), into Montesquieu-ism, into Tacitus-ism (here I leave out of view the concluding portion of the ""Annals"")–or even into Carlyle-ism–a thing which, I have been told, is not to be confounded with your ordinary affectation and bad grammar."|1|5|Marginalia|1846|Essay

Here the minute and perplexed incidents of the descent into the pyramid, are detailed, in verse, with quite as much precision and intelligibility as could be attained even by the coolest prose of Mr. Jeremy Bentham.|5|14|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Moore has vivacity; verbal and constructive dexterity; a musical ear not sufficiently cultivated; a vivid fancy; an epigrammatic spirit; and a fine taste–as far as it goes.|0|15|Marginalia|1846|Essay
I am not sure that Tennyson is not the greatest of poets.|0|17|Marginalia|1846|Essay
"The uncertainty attending the public conception of the term ""poet"" alone prevents me from demonstrating that he is."|1|17|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Other bards produce effects which are, now and then, otherwise produced than by what we call poems; but Tennyson an effect which only a poem does.|2|17|Marginalia|1846|Essay
His alone are idiosyncratic poems.|3|17|Marginalia|1846|Essay
"By the enjoyment or non-enjoyment of the ""Morte D'Arthur"" or of the ""Oenone,"" I would test any one's ideal sense."|4|17|Marginalia|1846|Essay
There are passages in his works which rivet a conviction I had long entertained, that the indefinite is an element in the true poiesis.|0|18|Marginalia|1846|Essay
"Why do some persons fatigue themselves in attempts to unravel such fantasy-pieces as the ""Lady of Shalott""?"|1|18|Marginalia|1846|Essay
"As well unweave the ""ventum textilem""."|2|18|Marginalia|1846|Essay
If the author did not deliberately propose to himself a suggestive indefinitiveness of meaning with the view of bringing about a definitiveness of vague and therefore of spiritual effect–this, at least, arose from the silent analytical promptings of that poetic genius which, in its supreme development, embodies all orders of intellectual capacity.|3|18|Marginalia|1846|Essay
I know that indefinitiveness is an element of the true music–I mean of the true musical expression.|0|19|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Give to it any undue decision–imbue it with any very determinate tone–and you deprive it at once of its ethereal, its ideal, its intrinsic and essential character.|1|19|Marginalia|1846|Essay
You dispel its luxury of dream.|2|19|Marginalia|1846|Essay
You dissolve the atmosphere of the mystic upon which it floats.|3|19|Marginalia|1846|Essay
You exhaust it of its breath of fiery.|4|19|Marginalia|1846|Essay
It now becomes a tangible and easily appreciable idea–a thing of the earth, earthy.|5|19|Marginalia|1846|Essay
It has not, indeed, lost its power to please, but all which I consider the distinctiveness of that power.|6|19|Marginalia|1846|Essay
And to the uncultivated talent, or to the unimaginative apprehension, this deprivation of its most delicate air will be, not unfrequently, a recommendation.|7|19|Marginalia|1846|Essay
A determinateness of expression is sought–and often by composers who should know better–is sought as a beauty rather than rejected as a blemish.|8|19|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Thus we have, even from high authorities, attempts at absolute imitation in music.|9|19|Marginalia|1846|Essay
"Who can forget the silliness of the ""Battle of Prague""?"|10|19|Marginalia|1846|Essay

"""Vocal music,"" says L'Abbate Gravina, who would have said the same thing of instrumental, ""ought to imitate the natural language of the human feelings and passions, rather than the warblings of canary birds, which our singers, now-a-days, affect so vastly to mimic with their quaverings and boasted cadences""."|12|19|Marginalia|1846|Essay
"This is true only so far as the ""rather"" is concerned."|13|19|Marginalia|1846|Essay
If any music must imitate anything, it were assuredly better to limit the imitation as Gravina suggests.|14|19|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Tennyson's shorter pieces abound in minute rhythmical lapses sufficient to asure me that–in common with all poets living or dead–he has neglected to make precise investigation of the principles of metre; but, on the other hand, so perfect is his rhythmical instinct in general that, like the present Viscount Canterbury, he seems to see with his ear.|0|20|Marginalia|1846|Essay
The increase, within a few years, of the magazine literature, is by no means to be regarded as indicating what some critics would suppose it to indicate–a downward tendency in American taste or in American letters.|0|22|Marginalia|1846|Essay
It is but a sign of the times, an indication of an era in which men are forced upon the curt, the condensed, the well-digested in place of the voluminous–in a word, upon journalism in lieu of dissertation.|1|22|Marginalia|1846|Essay
We need now the light artillery rather than the peace-makers of the intellect.|2|22|Marginalia|1846|Essay
I will not be sure that men at present think more profoundly than half a century ago, but beyond question they think with more rapidity, with more skill, with more tact, with more of method and less of excrescence in the thought.|3|22|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Besides all this, they have a vast increase in the thinking material; they have more facts, more to think about.|4|22|Marginalia|1846|Essay
For this reason, they are disposed to put the greatest amount of thought in the smallest compass and disperse it with the utmost attainable rapidity.|5|22|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Hence the journalism of the age; hence, in especial, magazines.|6|22|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Too many we cannot have, as a general proposition; but we demand that they have sufficient merit to render them noticeable in the beginning, and that they continue in existence sufficiently long to permit us a fair estimation of their value.|7|22|Marginalia|1846|Essay

Much has been said, of late, about the necessity of maintaining a proper nationality in American Letters; but what this nationality is, or what is to be gained by it, has never been distinctly understood.|0|24|Marginalia|1846|Essay
That an American should confine himself to American themes, or even prefer them, is rather a political than a literary idea–and at best is a questionable point.|1|24|Marginalia|1846|Essay
"We would do well to bear in mind that ""distance lends enchantment to the view""."|2|24|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Ceteris paribus, a foreign theme is, in a strictly literary sense, to be preferred.|3|24|Marginalia|1846|Essay
After all, the world at large is the only legitimate stage for the autorial histrio.|4|24|Marginalia|1846|Essay
But of the need of that nationality which defends our own literature, sustains our own men of letters, upholds our own dignity, and depends upon our own resources, there can not be the shadow of a doubt.|0|25|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Yet here is the very point at which we are most supine.|1|25|Marginalia|1846|Essay
"We complain of our want of International Copyright on the ground that this want justifies our publishers in inundating us with British opinion in British books; and yet when these very publishers, at their own obvious risk, and even obvious loss, do publish an American book, we turn up our noses at it with supreme contempt (this is a general thing) until it (the American book) has been dubbed ""readable"" by some literate Cockney critic."|2|25|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Is it too much to say that, with us, the opinion of Washington Irving–of Prescott- of Bryant–is a mere nullity in comparison with that of any anonymous sub-sub-editor of the Spectator, the Athenaeum, or the London Punch?|3|25|Marginalia|1846|Essay
It is not saying too much to say this.|4|25|Marginalia|1846|Essay
It is a solemn- an absolutely awful fact.|5|25|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Every publisher in the country will admit it to be a fact.|6|25|Marginalia|1846|Essay
There is not a more disgusting spectacle under the sun than our subserviency to British criticism.|7|25|Marginalia|1846|Essay
It is disgusting, first because it is truckling, servile, pusilanimous–secondly, because of its gross irrationality.|8|25|Marginalia|1846|Essay
We know the British to bear us little but ill will–we know that, in no case, do they utter unbiased opinions of American books–we know that in the few instances in which our writers have been treated with common decency in England, these writers have either openly paid homage to English institutions, or have had lurking at the bottom of their hearts a secret principle at war with Democracy:–we know all this, and yet, day after day, submit our necks to the degrading yoke of the crudest opinion that emanates from the fatherland.|9|25|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Now if we must have nationality, let it be a nationality that will throw off this yoke.|10|25|Marginalia|1846|Essay
The chief of the rhapsodists who have ridden us to death like the Old Man of the Mountain, is the ignorant and egotistical Wilson.|0|26|Marginalia|1846|Essay
We use the term rhapsodists with perfect deliberation; for, Macaulay, and Dilke, and one or two others, excepted, there is not in Great Britain a critic who can be fairly considered worthy the name.|1|26|Marginalia|1846|Essay
The Germans and even the French, are infinitely superior.|2|26|Marginalia|1846|Essay
As regards Wilson, no man ever penned worse criticism or better rhodomontade.|3|26|Marginalia|1846|Essay
"That he is ""egotistical"" his works show to all men, running as they read."|4|26|Marginalia|1846|Essay
"That he is ""ignorant"" let his absurd and continuous school-boy blunders about Homer bear witness."|5|26|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Not long ago we ourselves pointed out a series of similar inanities in his review of Miss Barret's [sic] poems–a series, we say, of gross blunders, arising from sheer ignorance–and we defy him or any one to answer a single syllable of what we then advanced.|6|26|Marginalia|1846|Essay
And yet this is the man whose simple dictum (to our shame be it spoken) has the power to make or to mar any American reputation!|0|27|Marginalia|1846|Essay
"In the last number of Blackwood, he has a continuation of the dull ""Specimens of the British Critics,"" and makes occasion wantonly to insult one of the noblest of our poets, Mr. Lowell."|1|27|Marginalia|1846|Essay
The point of the whole attack consists in the use of slang epithets and phrases of the most ineffably vulgar description.|2|27|Marginalia|1846|Essay
"""Squabashes"" is a pet term."|3|27|Marginalia|1846|Essay

Now were these indecencies perpetrated by an American critic, that critic would be sent to Coventry by the whole press of the country, but since it is Wilson who insults, we, as in duty bound, not only submit to the insult, but echo it, as an excellent jest, throughout the length and breadth of the land.|8|27|Marginalia|1846|Essay

"Some Frenchman–possibly Montaigne–says: ""People talk about thinking, but for my part I never think except when I sit down to write""."|0|29|Marginalia|1846|Essay
It is this never thinking, unless when we sit down to write, which is the cause of so much indifferent composition.|1|29|Marginalia|1846|Essay
But perhaps there is something more involved in the Frenchman's observation than meets the eye.|2|29|Marginalia|1846|Essay
It is certain that the mere act of inditing tends, in a great degree, to the logicalisation of thought.|3|29|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Whenever, on account of its vagueness, I am dissatisfied with a conception of the brain, I resort forthwith to the pen, for the purpose of obtaining, through its aid, the necessary form, consequence, and precision.|4|29|Marginalia|1846|Essay
How very commonly we hear it remarked that such and such thoughts are beyond the compass of words!|0|30|Marginalia|1846|Essay
I do not believe that any thought, properly so called, is out of the reach of language.|1|30|Marginalia|1846|Essay
I fancy, rather, that where difficulty in expression is experienced, there is, in the intellect which experiences it, a want either of deliberateness or of method.|2|30|Marginalia|1846|Essay
For my own part, I have never had a thought which I could not set down in words, with even more distinctness than that with which I conceived it:–as I have before observed, the thought is logicalised by the effort at (written) expression.|3|30|Marginalia|1846|Essay
There is, however, a class of fancies, of exquisite delicacy, which are not thoughts, and to which, as yet, I have found it absolutely impossible to adapt language.|0|31|Marginalia|1846|Essay
I use the word fancies at random, and merely because I must use some word; but the idea commonly attached to the term is not even remotely applicable to the shadows of shadows in question.|1|31|Marginalia|1846|Essay
They seem to me rather psychal than intellectual.|2|31|Marginalia|1846|Essay
They arise in the soul (alas, how rarely!|3|31|Marginalia|1846|Essay
) only at its epochs of most intense tranquillity–when the bodily and mental health are in perfection–and at those mere points of time where the confines of the waking world blend with those of the world of dreams.|4|31|Marginalia|1846|Essay
"I am aware of these ""fancies"" only when I am upon the very brink of sleep, with the consciousness that I am so."|5|31|Marginalia|1846|Essay
"I have satisfied myself that this condition exists but for an inappreciable point of time–yet it is crowded with these ""shadows of shadows""; and for absolute thought there is demanded time's endurance."|6|31|Marginalia|1846|Essay
"These ""fancies"" have in them a pleasurable ecstasy, as far beyond the most pleasurable of the world of wakefulness, or of dreams, as the Heaven of the Northman theology is beyond its Hell."|0|32|Marginalia|1846|Essay
I regard the visions, even as they arise, with an awe which, in some measure moderates or tranquillises the ecstasy–I so regard them, through a conviction (which seems a portion of the ecstasy itself) that this ecstasy, in itself, is of a character supernal to the Human Nature–is a glimpse of the spirit's outer world; and I arrive at this conclusion–if this term is at all applicable to instantaneous intuition–by a perception that the delight experienced has, as its element, but the absoluteness of novelty.|1|32|Marginalia|1846|Essay
I say the absoluteness- for in the fancies–let me now term them psychal impressions–there is really nothing even approximate in character to impressions ordinarily received.|2|32|Marginalia|1846|Essay
It is as if the five senses were supplanted by five myriad others alien to mortality.|3|32|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Now, so entire is my faith in the power of words, that at times I have believed it possible to embody even the evanescence of fancies such as I have attempted to describe.|0|33|Marginalia|1846|Essay
In experiments with this end in view, I have proceeded so far as, first, to control (when the bodily and mental health are good), the existence of the condition:- that is to say, I can now (unless when ill), be sure that the condition will supervene, if I so wish it, at the point of time already described: of its supervention until lately I could never be certain even under the most favorable circumstances.|1|33|Marginalia|1846|Essay
I mean to say, merely, that now I can be sure, when all circumstances are favorable, of the supervention of the condition, and feel even the capacity of inducing or compelling it:–the favorable circumstances, however, are not the less rare–else had I compelled already the Heaven into the Earth.|2|33|Marginalia|1846|Essay
I have proceeded so far, secondly, as to prevent the lapse from the Point of which I speak–the point of blending between wakefulness and sleep–as to prevent at will, I say, the lapse from this border–ground into the dominion of sleep.|0|34|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Not that I can continue the condition–not that I can render the point more than a point–but that I can startle myself from the point into wakefulness; and thus transfer the point itself into the realm of Memory–convey its impressions, or more properly their recollections, to a situation where (although still for a very brief period) I can survey them with the eye of analysis.|1|34|Marginalia|1846|Essay
For these reasons–that is to say, because I have been enabled to accomplish thus much–I do not altogether despair of embodying in words at least enough of the fancies in question to convey to certain classes of intellect, a shadowy conception of their character.|0|35|Marginalia|1846|Essay
In saying this I am not to be understood as supposing that the fancies or psychal impressions to which I allude are confined to my individual self–are not, in a word, common to all mankind–for on this point it is quite impossible that I should form an opinion–but nothing can be more certain than that even a partial record of the impressions would startle the universal intellect of mankind, by the supremeness of the novelty of the material employed, and of its consequent suggestions.|0|36|Marginalia|1846|Essay
In a word–should I ever write a paper on this topic, the world will be compelled to acknowledge that, at last, I have done an original thing.|1|36|Marginalia|1846|Essay
In general, our first impressions are true ones–the chief difficulty is in making sure which are the first.|0|38|Marginalia|1846|Essay
In early youth we read a poem, for instance, and are enraptured with it.|1|38|Marginalia|1846|Essay
At manhood we are assured by our reason that we had no reason to be enraptured.|2|38|Marginalia|1846|Essay
But some years elapse, and we return to our primitive admiration, just as a matured judgment enables us precisely to see what and why we admired.|3|38|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Thus, as individuals, we think in cycles, and may, from the frequency, or infrequency of our revolutions about the various thought-centres, form an accurate estimate of the advance of our thought toward maturity.|0|39|Marginalia|1846|Essay
It is really wonderful to observe how closely, in all the essentials of truth, the child–opinion coincides with that of the man proper–of the man at his best.|1|39|Marginalia|1846|Essay
And as with individuals so, perhaps, with mankind.|0|40|Marginalia|1846|Essay
When the world begins to return, frequently, to its first impressions, we shall then be warranted in looking for the millennium–or whatever it is:- we may safely take it for granted that we are attaining our maximum of wit, and of the happiness which is thence to ensue.|1|40|Marginalia|1846|Essay
The indications of such a return are, at present, like the visits of angels–but we have them now and then–in the case, for example, of credulity.|2|40|Marginalia|1846|Essay
The philosophic, of late days, are distinguished by that very facility in belief which was the characteristic of the illiterate half a century ago.|3|40|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Skepticism in regard to apparent miracles, is not, as formerly, an evidence either of superior wisdom or knowledge.|4|40|Marginalia|1846|Essay
In a word, the wise now believe–yesterday they would not believe–and day before yesterday (in the time of Strabo, for example) they believed, exclusively, anything and everything:–here, then, is one of the indicative cycles of discretion.|5|40|Marginalia|1846|Essay
I mention Strabo merely as an exception to the rule of his epoch–(just as one in a hurry for an illustration, might describe Mr. So and So to be as witty or as amiable as Mr. This and That is not–for so rarely did men reject in Strabo's time, and so much more rarely did they err by rejection, that the skepticism of this philosopher must be regarded as one of the most remarkable anomalies on record.|6|40|Marginalia|1846|Essay
I have not the slightest faith in Carlyle.|0|41|Marginalia|1846|Essay
In ten years–possibly in five–he will be remembered only as a butt for sarcasm.|1|41|Marginalia|1846|Essay
His linguistic Euphuisms might very well have been taken as prima facie evidence of his philosophic ones; they were the froth which indicated, first, the shallowness, and secondly, the confusion of the waters.|2|41|Marginalia|1846|Essay
I would blame no man of sense for leaving the works of Carlyle unread merely on account of these Euphuisms; for it might be shown a priori that no man capable of producing a definite impression upon his age or race, could or would commit himself to such inanities and insanities.|3|41|Marginalia|1846|Essay
The book about 'Hero-Worship'–is it possible that it ever excited a feeling beyond contempt?|4|41|Marginalia|1846|Essay
No hero-worshipper can possess anything within himself.|5|41|Marginalia|1846|Essay
That man is no man who stands in awe of his fellow-man.|6|41|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Genius regards genius with respect–with even enthusiastic admiration–but there is nothing of worship in the admiration, for it springs from a thorough cognizance of the one admired–from a perfect sympathy, the result of the cognizance; and it is needless to say, that sympathy and worship are antagonistic.|7|41|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Your hero-worshippers, for example–what do they know about Shakespeare?|8|41|Marginalia|1846|Essay
They worship him–rant about him–lecture about him–about him, him and nothing else–for no other reason than that he is utterly beyond their comprehension.|9|41|Marginalia|1846|Essay
They have arrived at an idea of his greatness from the pertinacity with which men have called him great.|10|41|Marginalia|1846|Essay
As for their own opinion about him–they really have none at all.|11|41|Marginalia|1846|Essay
In general the very smallest of mankind are the class of men-worshippers.|12|41|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Not one out of this class have ever accomplished anything beyond a very contemptible mediocrity.|13|41|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Carlyle, however, has rendered an important service (to posterity, at least) in pushing rant and cant to that degree of excess which inevitably induces reaction.|0|42|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Had he not appeared we might have gone on for yet another century, Emerson-izing in prose, Wordsworth-izing in poetry, and Fourier-izing in philosophy, Wilson-izing in criticism- Hudson-izing and Tom O'Bedlam-izing in everything.|1|42|Marginalia|1846|Essay
The author of the 'Sartor Resartus,' however, has overthrown the various arguments of his own order, by a personal reductio ad absurdum.|2|42|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Yet an Olympiad, perhaps, and the whole horde will be swept bodily from the memory of man–or be remembered only when we have occasion to talk of such fantastic tricks as, erewhile, were performed by the Abderites.|3|42|Marginalia|1846|Essay
If any ambitious man have a fancy a revolutionize, at one effort, the universal world of human thought, human opinion, and human sentiment, the opportunity is his own–the road to immortal renown lies straight, open, and unencumbered before him.|0|44|Marginalia|1846|Essay
All that he has to do is to write and publish a very little book.|1|44|Marginalia|1846|Essay
"Its title should be simple–a few plain words–""My Heart Laid Bare""."|2|44|Marginalia|1846|Essay
But–this little book must be true to its title.|3|44|Marginalia|1846|Essay
Now, is it not very singular that, with the rabid thirst for notoriety which distinguishes so many of mankind–so many, too, who care not a fig what is thought of them after death, there should not be found one man having sufficient hardihood to write this little book?|0|45|Marginalia|1846|Essay
To write, I say.|1|45|Marginalia|1846|Essay
There are ten thousand men who, if the book were once written, would laugh at the notion of being disturbed by its publication during their life, and who could not even conceive why they should object to its being published after their death.|2|45|Marginalia|1846|Essay
But to write it–there is the rub.|3|45|Marginalia|1846|Essay
No man dare write it.|4|45|Marginalia|1846|Essay
No man ever will dare write it.|5|45|Marginalia|1846|Essay

"What makes the matter worse, the critique is from the pen of one who, although undeservedly, holds, himself, some position as a poet:–and what makes the matter worst, the attack is anonymous, and (while ostensibly commending) most zealously endeavors to damn the young writer ""with faint praise""."|1|47|Marginalia|1846|Essay
In his whole life, the author of the criticism never published a poem, long or short, which could compare, either in the higher merits, or in the minor morals of the Muse, with the worst of Mr. Taylor's compositions.|2|47|Marginalia|1846|Essay

"In fact, the ""rhetoric"" of Mr. Taylor, in the sense intended by the critic, is Mr. Taylor's distinguishing excellence."|1|50|Marginalia|1846|Essay
He is, unquestionably, the most terse, glowing, and vigorous of all our poets, young or old–in point, I mean, of expression.|2|50|Marginalia|1846|Essay
"His sonorous, well-balanced rhythm puts me often in mind of Campbell (in spite of our anonymous friend's implied sneer at ""mere jingling of rhymes, brilliant and successful for the moment,"") and his rhetoric in general is of the highest order:–By ""rhetoric, I intend the mode generally in which thought is presented."|3|50|Marginalia|1846|Essay

Now the Wissahiccon is of so remarkable a loveliness that, were it flowing in England, it would be the theme of every bard, and the common topic of every tongue, if, indeed, its banks were not parcelled off in lots, at an exorbitant price, as building-sites for the villas of the opulent.|1|8|Morning On The Wissahiccon|1844|Essay

"The Wissahiccon, however, should be visited, not like ""fair Melrose,"" by moonlight, or even in cloudy weather, but amid the brightest glare of a noonday sun; for the narrowness of the gorge through which it flows, the height of the hills on either hand, and the density of the foliage, conspire to produce a gloominess, if not an absolute dreariness of effect, which, unless relieved by a bright general light, detracts from the mere beauty of the scene."|5|10|Morning On The Wissahiccon|1844|Essay

Full Particulars of the Voyage!|4|1|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The subjoined jeu d'esprit with the preceding heading in magnificent capitals, well interspersed with notes of admiration, was originally published, as matter of fact, in the New York Sun, a daily newspaper, and therein fully subserved the purpose of creating indigestible aliment for the quidnuncs during the few hours intervening between a couple of the Charleston mails.|0|2|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
"The rush for the ""sole paper which had the news"" was something beyond even the prodigious; and, in fact, if (as some assert) the Victoria did not absolutely accomplish the voyage recorded it will be difficult to assign a reason why she should not have accomplished it."|1|2|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax

The Atlantic has been actually crossed in a Balloon!|2|3|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
and this too without difficulty;without any great apparent danger;with thorough control of the machine;and in the inconceivably brief period of seventy-five hours from shore to shore!|3|3|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
"By the energy of an agent at Charleston, S. C., we are enabled to be the first to furnish the public with a detailed account of this most extraordinary voyage, which was performed between Saturday, the 6th instant, at 11 A.M. and 2 P.M., on Tuesday, the 9th instant, by Sir Everard Bringhurst; Mr. Osborne, a nephew of Lord Bentinck's; Mr. Monck Mason and Mr. Robert Holland, the well-known aeronauts; Mr. Harrison Ainsworth, author of ""Jack Sheppard,"" etc."|4|3|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
; and Mr. Henson the projector of the late unsuccessful flying machine;with two seamen from Woolwich;in all, eight persons.|5|3|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The particulars furnished below may be relied on as authentic and accurate in every respect, as, with a slight exception, they are copied verbatim from the joint diaries of Mr. Monck Mason and Mr. Harrison Ainsworth, to whose politeness our agent is also indebted for much verbal information respecting the balloon itself, its construction, and other matters of interest.|6|3|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The only alteration in the MS.|7|3|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
received, has been made for the purpose of throwing the hurried account of our agent, Mr. Forsyth, into a connected and intelligible form.|8|3|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
Two very decided failures, of late,;those of Mr. Henson and Sir George Cayley,;had much weakened the public interest in the subject of aerial navigation.|0|5|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
Mr. Henson's scheme (which at first was considered very feasible even by men of science) was founded upon the principle of an inclined plane, started from an eminence by an extrinsic force, applied and continued by the revolution of impinging vanes, in form and number resembling the vanes of a windmill.|1|5|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
But, in all the experiments made with models at the Adelaide Gallery, it was found that the operation of these fins not only did not propel the machine, but actually impeded its flight.|2|5|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The only propelling force it ever exhibited, was the mere impetus acquired from the descent of the inclined plane, and this impetus carried the machine farther when the vanes were at rest, than when they were in motion;a fact which sufficiently demonstrates their inutility, and in the absence of the propelling, which was also the sustaining power, the whole fabric would necessarily descend.|3|5|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
This consideration led Sir George Cayley to think only of adapting a propeller to some machine having of itself an independent power of support;in a word, to a balloon; the idea, however, being novel, or original, with Sir George, only so far as regards the mode of its application to practice.|4|5|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
He exhibited a model of his invention at the Polytechnic Institution.|5|5|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The propelling principle, or power, was here, also, applied to interrupted surfaces, or vanes, put in revolution.|6|5|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
These vanes were four in number, but were found entirely ineffectual in moving the balloon, or in aiding its ascending power.|7|5|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The whole project was thus a complete failure.|8|5|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
It was at this juncture that Mr. Monck Mason (whose voyage from Dover to Weilburg in the balloon Nassau occasioned so much excitement in 1837) conceived the idea of employing the principle of the Archimedean screw for the purpose of propulsion through the air- rightly attributing the failure of Mr. Henson's scheme, and of Sir George Cayley's to the interruption of surface in the independent vanes.|0|6|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
He made the first public experiment at Willis's Rooms, but afterward removed his model to the Adelaide Gallery.|1|6|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
Like Sir George Cayley's balloon, his own was an ellipsoid.|0|7|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
Its length was 13 feet 6 inches;height, 6 feet 8 inches.|1|7|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
It contained about 320 cubic feet of gas, which, if pure hydrogen, would support 21 pounds upon its first inflation, before the gas has time to deteriorate or escape.|2|7|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The weight of the whole machine and apparatus was 17 pounds;leaving about 4 pounds to spare.|3|7|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
Beneath the centre of the balloon, was a frame of light wood, about 9 feet long, and rigged on to the balloon itself with a net-work in the customary manner.|4|7|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
From this framework was suspended a wicker basket or car.|5|7|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The screw consists of an axis of hollow brass tube, 18 inches in length, through which, upon a semi-spiral inclined at 15 degrees, pass a series of steel-wire radii, 2 feet long, and thus projecting a foot on either side.|0|8|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
These radii are connected at the outer extremities by 2 bands of flattened wire; the whole in this manner forming the framework of the screw, which is completed by a covering of oiled silk cut into gores, and tightened so as to present a tolerably uniform surface.|1|8|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
At each end of its axis this screw is supported by pillars of hollow brass tube descending from the hoop.|2|8|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
In the lower ends of these tubes are holes in which the pivots of the axis revolve.|3|8|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
From the end of the axis which is next the car, proceeds a shaft of steel, connecting the screw with the pinion of a piece of spring machinery fixed in the car.|4|8|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
By the operation of this spring, the screw is made to revolve with great rapidity, communicating a progressive motion to the whole.|5|8|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
By means of the rudder, the machine was readily turned in any direction.|6|8|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The spring was of great power, compared with its dimensions, being capable of raising 45 pounds upon a barrel of 4 inches diameter, after the first turn, and gradually increasing as it was wound up.|7|8|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
It weighed, altogether, eight pounds six ounces.|8|8|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The rudder was a light frame of cane covered with silk, shaped somewhat like a battledoor, and was about 3 feet long, and at the widest, one foot.|9|8|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
Its weight was about 2 ounces.|10|8|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
It could be turned flat, and directed upward or downward, as well as to the right or left-, and thus enabled the aeronaut to transfer the resistance of the air which in an inclined position it must generate in its passage, to any side upon which he might desire to act; thus determining the balloon in the opposite direction.|11|8|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
This model (which, through want of time, we have necessarily described in an imperfect manner) was put in action at the Adelaide Gallery, where it accomplished a velocity of 5 miles per hour; although, strange to say, it excited very little interest in comparison with the previous complex machine of Mr. Henson;so resolute is the world to despise anything which carries with it an air of simplicity.|0|9|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
To accomplish the great desideratum of aerial navigation, it was very generally supposed that some exceedingly complicated application must be made of some unusually profound principle in dynamics.|1|9|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
So well satisfied, however, was Mr. Mason of the ultimate success of his invention, that he determined to construct immediately, if possible, a balloon of sufficient capacity to test the question by a voyage of some extent; the original design being to cross the British Channel, as before, in the Nassau balloon.|0|10|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
To carry out his views, he solicited and obtained the patronage of Sir Everard Bringhurst and Mr. Osborne, two gentlemen well known for scientific acquirement, and especially for the interest they have exhibited in the progress of aerostation.|1|10|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The project, at the desire of Mr. Osborne, was kept a profound secret from the public;the only persons entrusted with the design being those actually engaged in the construction of the machine, which was built (under the superintendence of Mr. Mason, Mr. Holland, Sir Everard Bringhurst, and Mr. Osborne) at the seat of the latter gentleman near Penstruthal, in Wales.|2|10|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
Mr. Henson, accompanied by his friend Mr. Ainsworth, was admitted to a private view of the balloon, on Saturday last; when the two gentlemen made final arrangements to be included in the adventure.|3|10|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
We are not informed for what reason the two seamen were also included in the party;but in the course of a day or two, we shall put our readers in possession of the minutest particulars respecting this extraordinary voyage.|4|10|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The balloon is composed of silk, varnished with the liquid gum caoutchouc.|0|11|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
It is of vast dimensions, containing more than 40,000 cubic feet of gas; but as coal gas was employed in place of the more expensive and inconvenient hydrogen, the supporting power of the machine, when fully inflated, and immediately after inflation, is not more than about 2500 pounds.|1|11|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The coal gas is not only much less costly, but is easily procured and managed.|2|11|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
For its introduction into common use for purposes of aerostation, we are indebted to Mr. Charles Green.|0|12|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
Up to his discovery, the process of inflation was not only exceedingly expensive, but uncertain.|1|12|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
Two and even three days have frequently been wasted in futile attempts to procure a sufficiency of hydrogen to fill a balloon, from which it had great tendency to escape, owing to its extreme subtlety, and its affinity for the surrounding atmosphere.|2|12|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
In a balloon sufficiently perfect to retain its contents of coal gas unaltered, in quantity or amount, for six months, an equal quantity of hydrogen could not be maintained in equal purity for six weeks.|3|12|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The supporting power being estimated at 2500 pounds, and the united weights of the party amounting only to about 1200, there was left a surplus of 1300, of which again 1200 was exhausted by ballast, arranged in bags of different sizes, with their respective weights marked upon them;by cordage, barometers, telescopes, barrels containing provision for a fortnight, water-casks, cloaks, carpet-bags, and various other indispensable matters, including a coffee-warmer, contrived for warming coffee by means of slack-lime, so as to dispense altogether with fire, if it should be judged prudent to do so.|0|13|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
All these articles, with the exception of the ballast, and a few trifles, were suspended from the hoop overhead.|1|13|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The car is much smaller and lighter, in proportion, than the one appended to the model.|2|13|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
It is formed of a light wicker, and is wonderfully strong for so frail looking a machine.|3|13|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
Its rim is about 4 feet deep.|4|13|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The rudder is also very much larger, in proportion, than that of the model; and the screw is considerably smaller.|5|13|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The balloon is furnished besides with a grapnel, and a guide-rope, which latter is of the most indispensable importance.|6|13|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
A few words, in explanation, will here be necessary for such of our readers as are not conversant with the details of aerostation.|7|13|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
As soon as the balloon quits the earth, it is subjected to the influence of many circumstances tending to create a difference in its weight; augmenting or diminishing its ascending power.|0|14|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
For example, there may be a deposition of dew upon the silk, to the extent, even, of several hundred pounds; ballast has then to be thrown out, or the machine may descend.|1|14|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
This ballast being discarded, and a clear sunshine evaporating the dew, and at the same time expanding the gas in the silk, the whole will again rapidly ascend.|2|14|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
To check this ascent, the only recourse is (or rather was, until Mr. Green's invention of the guide-rope) the permission of the escape of gas from the valve; but, in the loss of gas, is a proportionate general loss of ascending power; so that, in a comparatively brief period, the best-constructed balloon must necessarily exhaust all its resources, and come to the earth.|3|14|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
This was the great obstacle to voyages of length.|4|14|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The guide-rope remedies the difficulty in the simplest manner conceivable.|0|15|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
It is merely a very long rope which is suffered to trail from the car, and the effect of which is to prevent the balloon from changing its level in any material degree.|1|15|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
If, for example, there should be a deposition of moisture upon, the silk, and the machine begins to descend in consequence, there will be no necessity for discharging ballast to remedy the increase of weight, for it is remedied, or counteracted, in an exactly just proportion, by the deposit on the ground of just so much of the end of the rope as is necessary.|2|15|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
If, on the other hand, any circumstances should cause undue levity, and consequent ascent, this levity is immediately counteracted by the additional weight of rope upraised from the earth.|3|15|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
Thus, the balloon can neither ascend nor descend, except within very narrow limits, and its resources, either in gas or ballast, remain comparatively unimpaired.|4|15|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
When passing over an expanse of water, it becomes necessary to employ small kegs of copper or wood, filled with liquid ballast of a lighter nature than water.|5|15|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
These float, and serve all the purposes of a mere rope on land.|6|15|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
Another most important office of the guide-rope, is to point out the direction of the balloon.|7|15|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The rope drags, either on land or sea, while the balloon is free; the latter, consequently, is always in advance, when any progress whatever is made, a comparison, therefore, by means of the compass, of the relative positions of the two objects, will always indicate the course.|8|15|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
In the same way, the angle formed by the rope with the vertical axis of the machine, indicates the velocity.|9|15|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
When there is no angle;in other words, when the rope hangs perpendicularly, the whole apparatus is stationary; but the larger the angle, that is to say, the farther the balloon precedes the end of the rope, the greater the velocity; and the converse.|10|15|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
As the original design was to cross the British Channel, and alight as near Paris as possible, the voyagers had taken the precaution to prepare themselves with passports directed to all parts of the Continent, specifying the nature of the expedition, as in the case of the Nassau voyage, and entitling the adventurers to exemption from the usual formalities of office; unexpected events, however, rendered these passports superfluous.|0|16|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The inflation was commenced very quietly at day-break, on Saturday morning, the 6th instant in the courtyard of Wheal-Vor House, Mr. Osborne's seat, about a mile from Penstruthal, in North Wales; and at 7 minutes past 11, everything being ready for departure, the balloon was set free, rising gently but steadily, in a direction nearly South; no use being made, for the first half hour, of either the screw or the rudder.|0|17|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
We proceed now with the journal, as transcribed by Mr. Forsyth from the joint MSS.|1|17|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
of Mr. Monck Mason and Mr. Ainsworth.|2|17|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The body of the journal, as given, is in the handwriting of Mr. Mason, and a P. S. is appended, each day, by Mr. Ainsworth, who has in preparation, and will shortly give the public a more minute and, no doubt, a thrillingly interesting account of the voyage.|3|17|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
Saturday, April the 6th.|0|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
;Every preparation likely to embarrass us having been made overnight, we commenced the inflation this morning at daybreak; but owing to a thick fog which encumbered the folds of the silk and rendered it unmanageable, we did not get through before nearly eleven o'clock.|1|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
Cut loose, then, in high spirits, and rose gently but steadily, with a light breeze at North, which bore us in the direction of the Bristol Channel.|2|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
Found the ascending force greater than we had expected; and as we arose higher and so got clear of the cliffs, and more in the sun's rays, our ascent became very rapid.|3|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
I did not wish, however, to lose gas at so early a period of the adventure, and so concluded to ascend for the present.|4|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
We soon ran out our guide-rope; but even when we had raised it clear of the earth, we still went up very rapidly.|5|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The balloon was unusually steady, and looked beautifully.|6|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
In about 10 minutes after starting, the barometer indicated an altitude of 15,000 feet.|7|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The weather was remarkably fine, and the view of the subjacent country;a most romantic one when seen from any point;was now especially sublime.|8|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The numerous deep gorges presented the appearance of lakes, on account of the dense vapors with which they were filled, and the pinnacles and crags to the South East, piled in inextricable confusion, resembling nothing so much as the giant cities of Eastern fable.|9|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
We were rapidly approaching the mountains in the South, but our elevation was more than sufficient to enable us to pass them in safety.|10|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
In a few minutes we soared over them in fine style; and Mr. Ainsworth, with the seamen, was surprised at their apparent want of altitude when viewed from the car, the tendency of great elevation in a balloon being to reduce inequalities of the surface below, to nearly a dead level.|11|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
At half-past eleven still proceeding nearly South, we obtained our first view of the Bristol Channel; and, in fifteen minutes afterward, the line of breakers on the coast appeared immediately beneath us, and we were fairly out at sea.|12|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
We now resolved to let off enough gas to bring our guide-rope, with the buoys affixed, into the water.|13|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
This was immediately done, and we commenced a gradual descent.|14|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
In about 20 minutes our first buoy dipped, and at the touch of the second soon afterward, we remained stationary as to elevation.|15|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
We were all now anxious to test the efficiency of the rudder and screw, and we put them both into requisition forthwith, for the purpose of altering our direction more to the eastward, and in a line for Paris.|16|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
By means of the rudder we instantly effected the necessary change of direction, and our course was brought nearly at right angles to that of the wind; when we set in motion the spring of the screw, and were rejoiced to find it propel us readily as desired.|17|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
Upon this we gave nine hearty cheers, and dropped in the sea a bottle, inclosing a slip of parchment with a brief account of the principle of the invention.|18|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
Hardly, however, had we done with our rejoicings, when an unforeseen accident occurred which discouraged us in no little degree.|19|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The steel rod connecting the spring with the propeller was suddenly jerked out of place, at the car end, (by a swaying of the car through some movement of one of the two seamen we had taken up,) and in an instant hung dangling out of reach, from the pivot of the axis of the screw.|20|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
While we were endeavoring to regain it, our attention being completely absorbed, we became involved in a strong current of wind from the East, which bore us, with rapidly increasing force, toward the Atlantic.|21|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
We soon found ourselves driving out to sea at the rate of not less, certainly, than 50 or 60 miles an hour, so that we came up with Cape Clear, at some 40 miles to our North, before we had secured the rod, and had time to think what we were about.|22|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
It was now that Mr. Ainsworth made an extraordinary but, to my fancy, a by no means unreasonable or chimerical proposition, in which he was instantly seconded by Mr. Holland-viz.|23|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
: that we should take advantage of the strong gale which bore us on, and in place of beating back to Paris, make an attempt to reach the coast of North America.|24|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
After slight reflection, I gave a willing assent to this bold proposition, which (strange to say) met with objection from the two seamen only.|25|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
As the stronger party, however, we overruled their fears, and kept resolutely upon our course.|26|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
We steered due West; but as the trailing of the buoys materially impeded our progress, and we had the balloon abundantly at command, either for ascent or descent, we first threw out fifty pounds of ballast, and then wound up (by means of a windlass) so much of the rope as brought it quite clear of the sea.|27|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
We perceived the effect of this manoeuvre immediately, in a vastly increased rate of progress; and, as the gale freshened, we flew with a velocity nearly inconceivable; the guide-rope flying out behind the car, like a streamer from a vessel.|28|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
It is needless to say that a very short time sufficed us to lose sight of the coast.|29|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
We passed over innumerable vessels of all kinds, a few of which were endeavoring to beat up, but the most of them lying to.|30|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
We occasioned the greatest excitement on board all;an excitement greatly relished by ourselves, and especially by our two men, who, now under the influence of a dram of Geneva, seemed resolved to give all scruple, or fear, to the wind.|31|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
Many of the vessels fired signal guns; and in all we were saluted with loud cheers (which we heard with surprising distinctness) and the waving of caps and handkerchiefs.|32|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
We kept on in this manner throughout the day with no material incident, and, as the shades of night closed around us, we made a rough estimate of the distance traversed.|33|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
It could not have been less than 500 miles, and was probably much more.|34|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The propeller was kept in constant operation, and, no doubt, aided our progress materially.|35|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
As the sun went down, the gale freshened into an absolute hurricane, and the ocean beneath was clearly visible on account of its phosphorescence.|36|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The wind was from the East all night, and gave us the brightest omen of success.|37|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
We suffered no little from cold, and the dampness of the atmosphere was most unpleasant; but the ample space in the car enabled us to lie down, and by means of cloaks and a few blankets we did sufficiently well.|38|19|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
Sunday, the 7th.|0|20|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
[Mr. Mason's MS.|1|20|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
] This morning the gale, by 10, had subsided to an eight;or nine;knot breeze (for a vessel at sea), and bears us, perhaps, 30 miles per hour, or more.|2|20|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
It has veered, however, very considerably to the North; and now, at sundown, we are holding our course due West, principally by the screw and rudder, which answer their purposes to admiration.|3|20|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
I regard the project as thoroughly successful, and the easy navigation of the air in any direction (not exactly in the teeth of a gale) as no longer problematical.|4|20|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
We could not have made head against the strong wind of yesterday, but, by ascending, we might have got out of its influence, if requisite.|5|20|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
Against a pretty stiff breeze, I feel convinced, we can make our way with the propeller.|6|20|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
At noon, today, ascended to an elevation of nearly 25,000 feet, (about the height of Cotopaxi) by discharging ballast.|7|20|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
Did this to search for a more direct current, but found none so favorable as the one we are now in.|8|20|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
We have an abundance of gas to take us across this small pond, even should the voyage last 3 weeks.|9|20|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
I have not the slightest fear for the result.|10|20|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The difficulty has been strangely exaggerated and misapprehended.|11|20|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
I can choose my current, and should I find all currents against me, I can make very tolerable headway with the propeller.|12|20|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
We have had no incidents worth recording.|13|20|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax

[Mr. Mason's MS.|1|21|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
] This morning we had again some little trouble with the rod of the propeller, which must be entirely remodelled, for fear of serious accident;I mean the steel rod, not the vanes.|2|21|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The latter could not be improved.|3|21|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The wind has been blowing steadily and strongly from the North-East all day; and so far fortune seems bent upon favoring us.|4|21|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
Just before day, we were all somewhat alarmed at some odd noises and concussions in the balloon, accompanied with the apparent rapid subsidence of the whole machine.|5|21|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
These phenomena were occasioned by the expansion of the gas, through increase of heat in the atmosphere, and the consequent disruption of the minute particles of ice with which the network had become encrusted during the night.|6|21|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
Threw down several bottles to the vessels below.|7|21|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax

Some particulars of the descent were communicated, however, by Mr. Ainsworth to Mr. Forsyth.|1|23|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
It was nearly dead calm when the voyagers first came in view of the coast, which was immediately recognized by both the seamen, and by Mr. Osborne.|2|23|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The latter gentleman having acquaintances at Fort Moultrie, it was immediately resolved to descend in its vicinity.|3|23|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The balloon was brought over the beach (the tide being out and the sand hard, smooth, and admirably adapted for a descent), and the grapnel let go, which took firm hold at once.|4|23|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The inhabitants of the Island, and of the Fort, thronged out, of course, to see the balloon; but it was with the greatest difficulty that any one could be made to credit the actual voyage;the crossing of the Atlantic.|5|23|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
The grapnel caught at 2 P.M. precisely; and thus the whole voyage was completed in 75 hours; or rather less, counting from shore to shore.|6|23|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
No serious accident occurred.|7|23|The Balloon-Hoax|April 13, 1844|Hoax
