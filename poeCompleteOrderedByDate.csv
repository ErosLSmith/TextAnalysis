0|Pestis eram vivus–moriens tua mors ero. 0|0|0|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
1|HORROR and fatality have been stalking abroad in all ages. 39|0|1|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
2|Why then give a date to this story I have to tell? 97|1|1|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
3|Let it suffice to say, that at the period of which I speak, there existed, in the interior of Hungary, a settled although hidden belief in the doctrines of the Metempsychosis. 147|2|1|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
4|Of the doctrines themselves–that is, of their falsity, or of their probability–I say nothing. 322|3|1|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
5|"I assert, however, that much of our incredulity–as La Bruyere says of all our unhappiness–""vient de ne pouvoir etre seuls"". 415"|4|1|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
6|Upon the succession of a proprietor so young, with a character so well known, to a fortune so unparalleled, little speculation was afloat in regard to his probable course of conduct. 538|0|10|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
7|And, indeed, for the space of three days, the behavior of the heir out-heroded Herod, and fairly surpassed the expectations of his most enthusiastic admirers. 720|1|10|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
8|Shameful debaucheries–flagrant treacheries–unheard-of atrocities–gave his trembling vassals quickly to understand that no servile submission on their part–no punctilios of conscience on his own–were thenceforward to prove any security against the remorseless fangs of a petty Caligula. 878|2|10|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
9|On the night of the fourth day, the stables of the castle Berlifitzing were discovered to be on fire; and the unanimous opinion of the neighborhood added the crime of the incendiary to the already hideous list of the Baron's misdemeanors and enormities. 1163|3|10|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
10|But during the tumult occasioned by this occurrence, the young nobleman himself sat apparently buried in meditation, in a vast and desolate upper apartment of the family palace of Metzengerstein. 1416|0|11|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
11|The rich although faded tapestry hangings which swung gloomily upon the walls, represented the shadowy and majestic forms of a thousand illustrious ancestors. 1611|1|11|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
12|Here, rich-ermined priests, and pontifical dignitaries, familiarly seated with the autocrat and the sovereign, put a veto on the wishes of a temporal king, or restrained with the fiat of papal supremacy the rebellious sceptre of the Arch-enemy. 1769|2|11|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
13|There, the dark, tall statures of the Princes Metzengerstein–their muscular war-coursers plunging over the carcasses of fAllan foes–startled the steadiest nerves with their vigorous expression; and here, again, the voluptuous and swan-like figures of the dames of days gone by, floated away in the mazes of an unreal dance to the strains of imaginary melody. 2013|3|11|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
14|But as the Baron listened, or affected to listen, to the gradually increasing uproar in the stables of Berlifitzing–or perhaps pondered upon some more novel, some more decided act of audacity–his eyes became unwittingly rivetted to the figure of an enormous, and unnaturally colored horse, represented in the tapestry as belonging to a Saracen ancestor of the family of his rival. 2371|0|12|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
15|The horse itself, in the foreground of the design, stood motionless and statue-like–while farther back, its discomfited rider perished by the dagger of a Metzengerstein. 2751|1|12|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
16|On Frederick's lip arose a fiendish expression, as he became aware of the direction which his glance had, without his consciousness, assumed. 2920|0|13|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
17|Yet he did not remove it. 3061|1|13|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
18|On the contrary, he could by no means account for the overwhelming anxiety which appeared falling like a pall upon his senses. 3086|2|13|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
19|It was with difficulty that he reconciled his dreamy and incoherent feelings with the certainty of being awake. 3212|3|13|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
20|The longer he gazed the more absorbing became the spell–the more impossible did it appear that he could ever withdraw his glance from the fascination of that tapestry. 3323|4|13|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
21|But the tumult without becoming suddenly more violent, with a compulsory exertion he diverted his attention to the glare of ruddy light thrown full by the flaming stables upon the windows of the apartment. 3490|5|13|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
22|The action, however, was but momentary, his gaze returned mechanically to the wall. 3695|0|14|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
23|To his extreme horror and astonishment, the head of the gigantic steed had, in the meantime, altered its position. 3778|1|14|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
24|The neck of the animal, before arched, as if in compassion, over the prostrate body of its lord, was now extended, at full length, in the direction of the Baron. 3892|2|14|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
25|The eyes, before invisible, now wore an energetic and human expression, while they gleamed with a fiery and unusual red; and the distended lips of the apparently enraged horse left in full view his gigantic and disgusting teeth. 4053|3|14|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
26|Stupefied with terror, the young nobleman tottered to the door. 4281|0|15|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
27|As he threw it open, a flash of red light, streaming far into the chamber, flung his shadow with a clear outline against the quivering tapestry, and he shuddered to perceive that shadow–as he staggered awhile upon the threshold–assuming the exact position, and precisely filling up the contour, of the relentless and triumphant murderer of the Saracen Berlifitzing. 4344|1|15|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
28|To lighten the depression of his spirits, the Baron hurried into the open air. 4709|0|16|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
29|At the principal gate of the palace he encountered three equerries. 4787|1|16|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
30|With much difficulty, and at the imminent peril of their lives, they were restraining the convulsive plunges of a gigantic and fiery-colored horse. 4854|2|16|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
31|"""Whose horse? 5001"|0|17|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
32|"Where did you get him""? 5014"|1|17|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
33|demanded the youth, in a querulous and husky tone of voice, as he became instantly aware that the mysterious steed in the tapestried chamber was the very counterpart of the furious animal before his eyes. 5037|2|17|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
34|"""He is your own property, sire,"" replied one of the equerries, ""at least he is claimed by no other owner. 5241"|0|18|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
35|We caught him flying, all smoking and foaming with rage, from the burning stables of the Castle Berlifitzing. 5346|1|18|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
36|Supposing him to have belonged to the old Count's stud of foreign horses, we led him back as an estray. 5455|2|18|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
37|But the grooms there disclaim any title to the creature; which is strange, since he bears evident marks of having made a narrow escape from the flames. 5558|3|18|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
38|"""The letters W. V. B. are also branded very distinctly on his forehead,"" interrupted a second equerry, ""I supposed them, of course, to be the initials of Wilhelm Von Berlifitzing–but all at the castle are positive in denying any knowledge of the horse"". 5709"|0|19|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
39|But there are some points in the Hungarian superstition which were fast verging to absurdity. 5962|0|2|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
40|They–the Hungarians–differed very essentially from their Eastern authorities. 6055|1|2|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
41|"For example, ""The soul,"" said the former–I give the words of an acute and intelligent Parisian–""ne demeure qu'un seul fois dans un corps sensible: au reste–un cheval, un chien, un homme meme, n'est que la ressemblance peu tangible de ces animaux"". 6132"|2|2|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
42|"""Extremely singular""! 6379"|0|20|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
43|said the young Baron, with a musing air, and apparently unconscious of the meaning of his words. 6400|1|20|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
44|"""He is, as you say, a remarkable horse–a prodigious horse! 6496"|2|20|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
45|"although, as you very justly observe, of a suspicious and untractable character, let him be mine, however,"" he added, after a pause, ""perhaps a rider like Frederick of Metzengerstein, may tame even the devil from the stables of Berlifitzing"". 6554"|3|20|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
46|"""You are mistaken, my lord; the horse, as I think we mentioned, is not from the stables of the Count. 6796"|0|21|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
47|"If such had been the case, we know our duty better than to bring him into the presence of a noble of your family"". 6897"|1|21|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
48|"""True""! 7011"|0|22|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
49|observed the Baron, dryly, and at that instant a page of the bedchamber came from the palace with a heightened color, and a precipitate step. 7018|1|22|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
50|He whispered into his master's ear an account of the sudden disappearance of a small portion of the tapestry, in an apartment which he designated; entering, at the same time, into particulars of a minute and circumstantial character; but from the low tone of voice in which these latter were communicated, nothing escaped to gratify the excited curiosity of the equerries. 7159|2|22|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
51|The young Frederick, during the conference, seemed agitated by a variety of emotions. 7531|0|23|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
52|He soon, however, recovered his composure, and an expression of determined malignancy settled upon his countenance, as he gave peremptory orders that a certain chamber should be immediately locked up, and the key placed in his own possession. 7616|1|23|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
53|"""Have you heard of the unhappy death of the old hunter Berlifitzing""? 7858"|0|24|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
54|said one of his vassals to the Baron, as, after the departure of the page, the huge steed which that nobleman had adopted as his own, plunged and curvetted, with redoubled fury, down the long avenue which extended from the chateau to the stables of Metzengerstein. 7927|1|24|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
55|"""No""! 8191"|0|25|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
56|"said the Baron, turning abruptly toward the speaker, ""dead! 8196"|1|25|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
57|"say you""? 8255"|2|25|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
58|"""It is indeed true, my lord; and, to a noble of your name, will be, I imagine, no unwelcome intelligence"". 8264"|0|26|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
59|A rapid smile shot over the countenance of the listener. 8370|0|27|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
60|"""How died he""? 8426"|1|27|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
61|"""In his rash exertions to rescue a favorite portion of his hunting stud, he has himself perished miserably in the flames"". 8440"|0|28|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
62|"""I-n-d-e-e-d-""! 8562"|0|29|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
63|ejaculated the Baron, as if slowly and deliberately impressed with the truth of some exciting idea. 8577|1|29|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
64|The families of Berlifitzing and Metzengerstein had been at variance for centuries. 8676|0|3|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
65|Never before were two houses so illustrious, mutually embittered by hostility so deadly. 8759|1|3|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
66|"Indeed at the era of this history, it was observed by an old crone of haggard and sinister appearance, that ""fire and water might sooner mingle than a Berlifitzing clasp the hand of a Metzengerstein"". 8847"|2|3|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
67|"The origin of this enmity seems to be found in the words of an ancient prophecy–""A lofty name shall have a fearful fall when, as the rider over his horse, the mortality of Metzengerstein shall triumph over the immortality of Berlifitzing"". 9047"|3|3|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
68|"""Indeed;"" repeated the vassal. 9286"|0|30|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
69|"""Shocking""! 9316"|0|31|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
70|said the youth, calmly, and turned quietly into the chateau. 9327|1|31|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
71|From this date a marked alteration took place in the outward demeanor of the dissolute young Baron Frederick Von Metzengerstein. 9387|0|32|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
72|Indeed, his behavior disappointed every expectation, and proved little in accordance with the views of many a manoeuvering mamma; while his habits and manner, still less than formerly, offered any thing congenial with those of the neighboring aristocracy. 9515|1|32|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
73|He was never to be seen beyond the limits of his own domain, and, in this wide and social world, was utterly companionless–unless, indeed, that unnatural, impetuous, and fiery-colored horse, which he henceforward continually bestrode, had any mysterious right to the title of his friend. 9770|2|32|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
74|Numerous invitations on the part of the neighborhood for a long time, however, periodically came in. 10057|0|33|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
75|"""Will the Baron honor our festivals with his presence""? 10157"|1|33|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
76|"""Will the Baron join us in a hunting of the boar""? 10212"|2|33|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
77|"–""Metzengerstein does not hunt;"" ""Metzengerstein will not attend,"" were the haughty and laconic answers. 10262"|3|33|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
78|These repeated insults were not to be endured by an imperious nobility. 10366|0|34|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
79|Such invitations became less cordial–less frequent–in time they ceased altogether. 10437|1|34|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
80|"The widow of the unfortunate Count Berlifitzing was even heard to express a hope ""that the Baron might be at home when he did not wish to be at home, since he disdained the company of his equals; and ride when he did not wish to ride, since he preferred the society of a horse"". 10519"|2|34|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
81|This to be sure was a very silly explosion of hereditary pique; and merely proved how singularly unmeaning our sayings are apt to become, when we desire to be unusually energetic. 10797|3|34|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
82|The charitable, nevertheless, attributed the alteration in the conduct of the young nobleman to the natural sorrow of a son for the untimely loss of his parents–forgetting, however, his atrocious and reckless behavior during the short period immediately succeeding that bereavement. 10976|0|35|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
83|Some there were, indeed, who suggested a too haughty idea of self-consequence and dignity. 11258|1|35|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
84|Others again (among them may be mentioned the family physician) did not hesitate in speaking of morbid melancholy, and hereditary ill-health; while dark hints, of a more equivocal nature, were current among the multitude. 11348|2|35|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
85|Indeed, the Baron's perverse attachment to his lately-acquired charger–an attachment which seemed to attain new strength from every fresh example of the animal's ferocious and demon-like propensities- at length became, in the eyes of all reasonable men, a hideous and unnatural fervor. 11569|0|36|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
86|In the glare of noon–at the dead hour of night–in sickness or in health–in calm or in tempest–the young Metzengerstein seemed rivetted to the saddle of that colossal horse, whose intractable audacities so well accorded with his own spirit. 11854|1|36|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
87|There were circumstances, moreover, which coupled with late events, gave an unearthly and portentous character to the mania of the rider, and to the capabilities of the steed. 12093|0|37|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
88|The space passed over in a single leap had been accurately measured, and was found to exceed, by an astounding difference, the wildest expectations of the most imaginative. 12268|1|37|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
89|The Baron, besides, had no particular name for the animal, although all the rest in his collection were distinguished by characteristic appellations. 12440|2|37|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
90|His stable, too, was appointed at a distance from the rest; and with regard to grooming and other necessary offices, none but the owner in person had ventured to officiate, or even to enter the enclosure of that particular stall. 12589|3|37|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
91|It was also to be observed, that although the three grooms, who had caught the steed as he fled from the conflagration at Berlifitzing, had succeeded in arresting his course, by means of a chain-bridle and noose–yet no one of the three could with any certainty affirm that he had, during that dangerous struggle, or at any period thereafter, actually placed his hand upon the body of the beast. 12818|4|37|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
92|Instances of peculiar intelligence in the demeanor of a noble and high-spirited horse are not to be supposed capable of exciting unreasonable attention–especially among men who, daily trained to the labors of the chase, might appear well acquainted with the sagacity of a horse–but there were certain circumstances which intruded themselves per force upon the most skeptical and phlegmatic; and it is said there were times when the animal caused the gaping crowd who stood around to recoil in horror from the deep and impressive meaning of his terrible stamp–times when the young Metzengerstein turned pale and shrunk away from the rapid and searching expression of his earnest and human-looking eye. 13212|5|37|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
93|Among all the retinue of the Baron, however, none were found to doubt the ardor of that extraordinary affection which existed on the part of the young nobleman for the fiery qualities of his horse; at least, none but an insignificant and misshapen little page, whose deformities were in everybody's way, and whose opinions were of the least possible importance. 13912|0|38|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
94|He–if his ideas are worth mentioning at all–had the effrontery to assert that his master never vaulted into the saddle without an unaccountable and almost imperceptible shudder, and that, upon his return from every long-continued and habitual ride, an expression of triumphant malignity distorted every muscle in his countenance. 14273|1|38|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
95|One tempestuous night, Metzengerstein, awaking from a heavy slumber, descended like a maniac from his chamber, and, mounting in hot haste, bounded away into the mazes of the forest. 14602|0|39|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
96|An occurrence so common attracted no particular attention, but his return was looked for with intense anxiety on the part of his domestics, when, after some hours' absence, the stupendous and magnificent battlements of the Chateau Metzengerstein, were discovered crackling and rocking to their very foundation, under the influence of a dense and livid mass of ungovernable fire. 14783|1|39|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
97|To be sure the words themselves had little or no meaning. 15161|0|4|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
98|But more trivial causes have given rise–and that no long while ago–to consequences equally eventful. 15218|1|4|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
99|Besides, the estates, which were contiguous, had long exercised a rival influence in the affairs of a busy government. 15318|2|4|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
100|Moreover, near neighbors are seldom friends; and the inhabitants of the Castle Berlifitzing might look, from their lofty buttresses, into the very windows of the palace Metzengerstein. 15436|3|4|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
101|Least of all had the more than feudal magnificence, thus discovered, a tendency to allay the irritable feelings of the less ancient and less wealthy Berlifitzings. 15620|4|4|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
102|What wonder then, that the words, however silly, of that prediction, should have succeeded in setting and keeping at variance two families already predisposed to quarrel by every instigation of hereditary jealousy? 15783|5|4|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
103|The prophecy seemed to imply–if it implied anything–a final triumph on the part of the already more powerful house; and was of course remembered with the more bitter animosity by the weaker and less influential. 15997|6|4|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
104|As the flames, when first seen, had already made so terrible a progress that all efforts to save any portion of the building were evidently futile, the astonished neighborhood stood idly around in silent and pathetic wonder. 16208|0|40|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
105|But a new and fearful object soon rivetted the attention of the multitude, and proved how much more intense is the excitement wrought in the feelings of a crowd by the contemplation of human agony, than that brought about by the most appalling spectacles of inanimate matter. 16432|1|40|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
106|"Up the long avenue of aged oaks which led from the forest to the main entrance of the Chateau Metzengerstein, a steed, bearing an unbonneted and disordered rider, was seen leaping with an impetuosity which outstripped the very Demon of the Tempest, and extorted from every stupefied beholder the ejaculation–""horrible"". 16707"|0|41|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
107|The career of the horseman was indisputably, on his own part, uncontrollable. 17026|0|42|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
108|The agony of his countenance, the convulsive struggle of his frame, gave evidence of superhuman exertion: but no sound, save a solitary shriek, escaped from his lacerated lips, which were bitten through and through in the intensity of terror. 17103|1|42|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
109|One instant, and the clattering of hoofs resounded sharply and shrilly above the roaring of the flames and the shrieking of the winds–another, and, clearing at a single plunge the gate-way and the moat, the steed bounded far up the tottering staircases of the palace, and, with its rider, disappeared amid the whirlwind of chaotic fire. 17345|2|42|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
110|The fury of the tempest immediately died away, and a dead calm sullenly succeeded. 17681|0|43|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
111|A white flame still enveloped the building like a shroud, and, streaming far away into the quiet atmosphere, shot forth a glare of preternatural light; while a cloud of smoke settled heavily over the battlements in the distinct colossal figure of–a horse. 17763|1|43|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
112|Wilhelm, Count Berlifitzing, although loftily descended, was, at the epoch of this narrative, an infirm and doting old man, remarkable for nothing but an inordinate and inveterate personal antipathy to the family of his rival, and so passionate a love of horses, and of hunting, that neither bodily infirmity, great age, nor mental incapacity, prevented his daily participation in the dangers of the chase. 18018|0|5|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
113|Frederick, Baron Metzengerstein, was, on the other hand, not yet Mary, followed him quickly after. 18424|0|6|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
114|Frederick was, at that time, in his fifteenth year. 18522|1|6|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
115|In a city, fifteen years are no long period–a child may be still a child in his third lustrum: but in a wilderness–in so magnificent a wilderness as that old principality, fifteen years have a far deeper meaning. 18573|2|6|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
116|The beautiful Lady Mary! 18785|0|7|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
117|How could she die? 18809|1|7|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
118|–and of consumption! 18827|2|7|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
119|But it is a path I have prayed to follow. 18847|3|7|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
120|I would wish all I love to perish of that gentle disease. 18888|4|7|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
121|How glorious–to depart in the heyday of the young blood–the heart of all passion–the imagination all fire–amid the remembrances of happier days–in the fall of the year- and so be buried up forever in the gorgeous autumnal leaves! 18945|5|7|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
122|Thus died the Lady Mary. 19174|0|8|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
123|The young Baron Frederick stood without a living relative by the coffin of his dead mother. 19198|1|8|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
124|He placed his hand upon her placid forehead. 19289|2|8|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
125|No shudder came over his delicate frame–no sigh from his flinty bosom. 19333|3|8|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
126|Heartless, self-willed and impetuous from his childhood, he had reached the age of which I speak through a career of unfeeling, wanton, and reckless dissipation; and a barrier had long since arisen in the channel of all holy thoughts and gentle recollections. 19403|4|8|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
127|From some peculiar circumstances attending the administration of his father, the young Baron, at the decease of the former, entered immediately upon his vast possessions. 19662|0|9|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
128|Such estates were seldom held before by a nobleman of Hungary. 19832|1|9|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
129|His castles were without number. 19894|2|9|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']

131|The boundary line of his dominions was never clearly defined; but his principal park embraced a circuit of fifty miles. 20001|4|9|Metzengerstein|1832-01-14 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Satire']
132|And stepped at once into a cooler clime. 20120|0|1|The Duc De L'Omelette|1832-03-03 00:00:00|['Humor']

154|Hereupon his Grace rubbed his eyes, yawned, shrugged his shoulders, reflected. 21363|8|13|The Duc De L'Omelette|1832-03-03 00:00:00|['Humor']
155|Having become satisfied of his identity, he took a bird's eye view of his whereabouts. 21441|9|13|The Duc De L'Omelette|1832-03-03 00:00:00|['Humor']
156|The apartment was superb. 21527|0|14|The Duc De L'Omelette|1832-03-03 00:00:00|['Humor']
157|Even De L'Omelette pronounced it bien comme il faut. 21552|1|14|The Duc De L'Omelette|1832-03-03 00:00:00|['Humor']
158|It was not its length nor its breadth,–but its height–ah, that was appalling! 21604|2|14|The Duc De L'Omelette|1832-03-03 00:00:00|['Humor']
159|–There was no ceiling–certainly none- but a dense whirling mass of fiery-colored clouds. 21681|3|14|The Duc De L'Omelette|1832-03-03 00:00:00|['Humor']
160|His Grace's brain reeled as he glanced upward. 21769|4|14|The Duc De L'Omelette|1832-03-03 00:00:00|['Humor']
161|From above, hung a chain of an unknown blood-red metal–its upper end lost, like the city of Boston, parmi les nues. 21815|5|14|The Duc De L'Omelette|1832-03-03 00:00:00|['Humor']
162|From its nether extremity swung a large cresset. 21930|6|14|The Duc De L'Omelette|1832-03-03 00:00:00|['Humor']
163|The Duc knew it to be a ruby; but from it there poured a light so intense, so still, so terrible, Persia never worshipped such–Gheber never imagined such–Mussulman never dreamed of such when, drugged with opium, he has tottered to a bed of poppies, his back to the flowers, and his face to the God Apollo. 21978|7|14|The Duc De L'Omelette|1832-03-03 00:00:00|['Humor']
164|The Duc muttered a slight oath, decidedly approbatory. 22283|8|14|The Duc De L'Omelette|1832-03-03 00:00:00|['Humor']
165|The corners of the room were rounded into niches. 22337|0|15|The Duc De L'Omelette|1832-03-03 00:00:00|['Humor']
166|Three of these were filled with statues of gigantic proportions. 22386|1|15|The Duc De L'Omelette|1832-03-03 00:00:00|['Humor']
167|Their beauty was Grecian, their deformity Egyptian, their tout ensemble French. 22450|2|15|The Duc De L'Omelette|1832-03-03 00:00:00|['Humor']
168|In the fourth niche the statue was veiled; it was not colossal. 22529|3|15|The Duc De L'Omelette|1832-03-03 00:00:00|['Humor']
169|But then there was a taper ankle, a sandalled foot. 22592|4|15|The Duc De L'Omelette|1832-03-03 00:00:00|['Humor']
170|De L'Omelette pressed his hand upon his heart, closed his eyes, raised them, and caught his Satanic Majesty–in a blush. 22643|5|15|The Duc De L'Omelette|1832-03-03 00:00:00|['Humor']

182|O luxury! 23155|9|16|The Duc De L'Omelette|1832-03-03 00:00:00|['Humor']
183|But the Duc's heart is fainting within him. 23164|0|17|The Duc De L'Omelette|1832-03-03 00:00:00|['Humor']
184|He is not, however, as you suppose, dizzy with magnificence, nor drunk with the ecstatic breath of those innumerable censers. 23207|1|17|The Duc De L'Omelette|1832-03-03 00:00:00|['Humor']

189|He could not help imagining that the glorious, the voluptuous, the never-dying melodies which pervaded that hall, as they passed filtered and transmuted through the alchemy of the enchanted window-panes, were the wailings and the howlings of the hopeless and the damned! 23566|1|18|The Duc De L'Omelette|1832-03-03 00:00:00|['Humor']
190|And there, too! 23836|2|18|The Duc De L'Omelette|1832-03-03 00:00:00|['Humor']

407|I know not how it is, but in scrutinizing her strange model and singular cast of spars, her huge size and overgrown suits of canvas, her severely simple bow and antiquated stern, there will occasionally flash across my mind a sensation of familiar things, and there is always mixed up with such indistinct shadows of recollection, an unaccountable memory of old foreign chronicles and ages long ago. 41660|4|16|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']

441|The crew glide to and fro like the ghosts of buried centuries; their eyes have an eager and uneasy meaning; and when their fingers fall athwart my path in the wild glare of the battle-lanterns, I feel as I have never felt before, although I have been all my life a dealer in antiquities, and have imbibed the shadows of fAllan columns at Balbec, and Tadmor, and Persepolis, until my very soul has become a ruin. 46710|1|21|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
442|When I look around me I feel ashamed of my former apprehensions. 47121|0|22|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
443|If I trembled at the blast which has hitherto attended us, shall I not stand aghast at a warring of wind and ocean, to convey any idea of which the words tornado and simoom are trivial and ineffective? 47185|1|22|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
444|All in the immediate vicinity of the ship is the blackness of eternal night, and a chaos of foamless water; but, about a league on either side of us, may be seen, indistinctly and at intervals, stupendous ramparts of ice, towering away into the desolate sky, and looking like the walls of the universe. 47386|2|22|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
445|As I imagined, the ship proves to be in a current; if that appellation can properly be given to a tide which, howling and shrieking by the white ice, thunders on to the southward with a velocity like the headlong dashing of a cataract. 47688|0|23|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
446|To conceive the horror of my sensations is, I presume, utterly impossible; yet a curiosity to penetrate the mysteries of these awful regions, predominates even over my despair, and will reconcile me to the most hideous aspect of death. 47923|0|24|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
447|It is evident that we are hurrying onwards to some exciting knowledge --some never-to-be-imparted secret, whose attainment is destruction. 48158|1|24|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
448|Perhaps this current leads us to the southern pole itself. 48296|2|24|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
449|It must be confessed that a supposition apparently so wild has every probability in its favor. 48354|3|24|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
450|The crew pace the deck with unquiet and tremulous step; but there is upon their countenances an expression more of the eagerness of hope than of the apathy of despair. 48448|0|25|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
451|In the meantime the wind is still in our poop, and, as we carry a crowd of canvas, the ship is at times lifted bodily from out the sea --Oh, horror upon horror! 48615|0|26|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
452|the ice opens suddenly to the right, and to the left, and we are whirling dizzily, in immense concentric circles, round and round the borders of a gigantic amphitheatre, the summit of whose walls is lost in the darkness and the distance. 48775|1|26|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
453|But little time will be left me to ponder upon my destiny --the circles rapidly grow small --we are plunging madly within the grasp of the whirlpool --and amid a roaring, and bellowing, and thundering of ocean and of tempest, the ship is quivering, oh God! 49012|2|26|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
454|and --going down. 49268|3|26|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
455|NOTE. 49285|0|27|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
456|"--The ""MS. 49290"|1|27|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
457|"Found in a Bottle,"" was originally published in 1831 [1833], and it was not until many years afterwards that I became acquainted with the maps of Mercator, in which the ocean is represented as rushing, by four mouths, into the (northern) Polar Gulf, to be absorbed into the bowels of the earth; the Pole itself being represented by a black rock, towering to a prodigious height. 49300"|2|27|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
458|Our vessel was a beautiful ship of about four hundred tons, copper-fastened, and built at Bombay of Malabar teak. 49678|0|3|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
459|She was freighted with cotton-wool and oil, from the Lachadive islands. 49791|1|3|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
460|We had also on board coir, jaggeree, ghee, cocoa-nuts, and a few cases of opium. 49862|2|3|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
461|The stowage was clumsily done, and the vessel consequently crank. 49942|3|3|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
462|We got under way with a mere breath of wind, and for many days stood along the eastern coast of Java, without any other incident to beguile the monotony of our course than the occasional meeting with some of the small grabs of the Archipelago to which we were bound. 50007|0|4|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
463|One evening, leaning over the taffrail, I observed a very singular, isolated cloud, to the N.W. 50273|0|5|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
464|It was remarkable, as well for its color, as from its being the first we had seen since our departure from Batavia. 50368|1|5|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
465|No watch was set, and the crew, consisting principally of Malays, stretched themselves deliberately upon deck. 50483|10|5|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
466|I went below --not without a full presentiment of evil. 50593|11|5|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
467|Indeed, every appearance warranted me in apprehending a Simoom. 50648|12|5|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
468|I told the captain my fears; but he paid no attention to what I said, and left me without deigning to give a reply. 50711|13|5|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
469|My uneasiness, however, prevented me from sleeping, and about midnight I went upon deck. 50826|14|5|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
470|--As I placed my foot upon the upper step of the companion-ladder, I was startled by a loud, humming noise, like that occasioned by the rapid revolution of a mill-wheel, and before I could ascertain its meaning, I found the ship quivering to its centre. 50914|15|5|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
471|In the next instant, a wilderness of foam hurled us upon our beam-ends, and, rushing over us fore and aft, swept the entire decks from stem to stern. 51167|16|5|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
472|I watched it attentively until sunset, when it spread all at once to the eastward and westward, girting in the horizon with a narrow strip of vapor, and looking like a long line of low beach. 51316|2|5|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
473|My notice was soon afterwards attracted by the dusky-red appearance of the moon, and the peculiar character of the sea. 51507|3|5|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
474|The latter was undergoing a rapid change, and the water seemed more than usually transparent. 51626|4|5|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
475|Although I could distinctly see the bottom, yet, heaving the lead, I found the ship in fifteen fathoms. 51719|5|5|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
476|The air now became intolerably hot, and was loaded with spiral exhalations similar to those arising from heat iron. 51822|6|5|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
477|As night came on, every breath of wind died away, an more entire calm it is impossible to conceive. 51937|7|5|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
478|The flame of a candle burned upon the poop without the least perceptible motion, and a long hair, held between the finger and thumb, hung without the possibility of detecting a vibration. 52036|8|5|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
479|However, as the captain said he could perceive no indication of danger, and as we were drifting in bodily to shore, he ordered the sails to be furled, and the anchor let go. 52223|9|5|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
480|The extreme fury of the blast proved, in a great measure, the salvation of the ship. 52396|0|6|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
481|Although completely water-logged, yet, as her masts had gone by the board, she rose, after a minute, heavily from the sea, and, staggering awhile beneath the immense pressure of the tempest, finally righted. 52480|1|6|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
482|By what miracle I escaped destruction, it is impossible to say. 52687|0|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
483|Stunned by the shock of the water, I found myself, upon recovery, jammed in between the stern-post and rudder. 52750|1|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
484|The frame-work of our stern was shattered excessively, and, in almost every respect, we had received considerable injury; but to our extreme Joy we found the pumps unchoked, and that we had made no great shifting of our ballast. 52860|10|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
485|The main fury of the blast had already blown over, and we apprehended little danger from the violence of the wind; but we looked forward to its total cessation with dismay; well believing, that, in our shattered condition, we should inevitably perish in the tremendous swell which would ensue. 53088|11|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
486|But this very just apprehension seemed by no means likely to be soon verified. 53381|12|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
487|For five entire days and nights --during which our only subsistence was a small quantity of jaggeree, procured with great difficulty from the forecastle --the hulk flew at a rate defying computation, before rapidly succeeding flaws of wind, which, without equalling the first violence of the Simoom, were still more terrific than any tempest I had before encountered. 53459|13|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
488|Our course for the first four days was, with trifling variations, S.E. and by S.; and we must have run down the coast of New Holland. 53826|14|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
489|--On the fifth day the cold became extreme, although the wind had hauled round a point more to the northward. 53959|15|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
490|--The sun arose with a sickly yellow lustre, and clambered a very few degrees above the horizon --emitting no decisive light. 54068|16|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
491|--There were no clouds apparent, yet the wind was upon the increase, and blew with a fitful and unsteady fury. 54193|17|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
492|About noon, as nearly as we could guess, our attention was again arrested by the appearance of the sun. 54303|18|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
493|It gave out no light, properly so called, but a dull and sullen glow without reflection, as if all its rays were polarized. 54406|19|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
494|With great difficulty I gained my feet, and looking dizzily around, was, at first, struck with the idea of our being among breakers; so terrific, beyond the wildest imagination, was the whirlpool of mountainous and foaming ocean within which we were engulfed. 54529|2|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
495|Just before sinking within the turgid sea, its central fires suddenly went out, as if hurriedly extinguished by some unaccountable power. 54788|20|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
496|It was a dim, sliver-like rim, alone, as it rushed down the unfathomable ocean. 54925|21|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
497|After a while, I heard the voice of an old Swede, who had shipped with us at the moment of our leaving port. 55004|3|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
498|I hallooed to him with all my strength, and presently he came reeling aft. 55112|4|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
499|We soon discovered that we were the sole survivors of the accident. 55186|5|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
500|All on deck, with the exception of ourselves, had been swept overboard; --the captain and mates must have perished as they slept, for the cabins were deluged with water. 55253|6|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
501|Without assistance, we could expect to do little for the security of the ship, and our exertions were at first paralyzed by the momentary expectation of going down. 55422|7|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
502|Our cable had, of course, parted like pack-thread, at the first breath of the hurricane, or we should have been instantaneously overwhelmed. 55586|8|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
503|We scudded with frightful velocity before the sea, and the water made clear breaches over us. 55726|9|7|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
504|We waited in vain for the arrival of the sixth day --that day to me has not arrived --to the Swede, never did arrive. 55819|0|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
505|Thenceforward we were enshrouded in patchy darkness, so that we could not have seen an object at twenty paces from the ship. 55936|1|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
506|The swell surpassed anything I had imagined possible, and that we were not instantly buried is a miracle. 56060|10|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
507|My companion spoke of the lightness of our cargo, and reminded me of the excellent qualities of our ship; but I could not help feeling the utter hopelessness of hope itself, and prepared myself gloomily for that death which I thought nothing could defer beyond an hour, as, with every knot of way the ship made, the swelling of the black stupendous seas became more dismally appalling. 56165|11|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
508|At times we gasped for breath at an elevation beyond the albatross --at times became dizzy with the velocity of our descent into some watery hell, where the air grew stagnant, and no sound disturbed the slumbers of the kraken. 56550|12|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
509|Eternal night continued to envelop us, all unrelieved by the phosphoric sea-brilliancy to which we had been accustomed in the tropics. 56776|2|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
510|We observed too, that, although the tempest continued to rage with unabated violence, there was no longer to be discovered the usual appearance of surf, or foam, which had hitherto attended us. 56910|3|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
511|All around were horror, and thick gloom, and a black sweltering desert of ebony. 57103|4|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
512|--Superstitious terror crept by degrees into the spirit of the old Swede, and my own soul was wrapped up in silent wonder. 57183|5|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
513|We neglected all care of the ship, as worse than useless, and securing ourselves, as well as possible, to the stump of the mizen-mast, looked out bitterly into the world of ocean. 57305|6|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
514|We had no means of calculating time, nor could we form any guess of our situation. 57484|7|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
515|We were, however, well aware of having made farther to the southward than any previous navigators, and felt great amazement at not meeting with the usual impediments of ice. 57566|8|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
516|In the meantime every moment threatened to be our last --every mountainous billow hurried to overwhelm us. 57739|9|8|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
517|We were at the bottom of one of these abysses, when a quick scream from my companion broke fearfully upon the night. 57845|0|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
518|"""See! 57961"|1|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
519|Her huge hull was of a deep dingy black, unrelieved by any of the customary carvings of a ship. 57966|10|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
520|A single row of brass cannon protruded from her open ports, and dashed from their polished surfaces the fires of innumerable battle-lanterns, which swung to and fro about her rigging. 58061|11|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
521|But what mainly inspired us with horror and astonishment, was that she bore up under a press of sail in the very teeth of that supernatural sea, and of that ungovernable hurricane. 58244|12|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
522|When we first discovered her, her bows were alone to be seen, as she rose slowly from the dim and horrible gulf beyond her. 58424|13|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
523|For a moment of intense terror she paused upon the giddy pinnacle, as if in contemplation of her own sublimity, then trembled and tottered, and --came down. 58547|14|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
524|"see""! 58703"|2|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
525|"cried he, shrieking in my ears, ""Almighty God! 58708"|3|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']

527|"see""! 58758"|5|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
528|As he spoke, I became aware of a dull, sullen glare of red light which streamed down the sides of the vast chasm where we lay, and threw a fitful brilliancy upon our deck. 58763|6|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
529|Casting my eyes upwards, I beheld a spectacle which froze the current of my blood. 58934|7|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
530|At a terrific height directly above us, and upon the very verge of the precipitous descent, hovered a gigantic ship of, perhaps, four thousand tons. 59016|8|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
531|Although upreared upon the summit of a wave more than a hundred times her own altitude, her apparent size exceeded that of any ship of the line or East Indiaman in existence. 59164|9|9|Ms. Found In A Bottle|1833-10-19 00:00:00|['Adventure']
532|Itself, by itself, solely, one everlasting, and single. 59338|0|0|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
533|PLATO: SYMPOS. 59393|1|0|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
534|WITH a feeling of deep yet most singular affection I regarded my friend Morella. 59407|0|1|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
535|Thrown by accident into her society many years ago, my soul from our first meeting, burned with fires it had never before known; but the fires were not of Eros, and bitter and tormenting to my spirit was the gradual conviction that I could in no manner define their unusual meaning or regulate their vague intensity. 59487|1|1|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
536|Yet we met; and fate bound us together at the altar, and I never spoke of passion nor thought of love. 59803|2|1|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
537|She, however, shunned society, and, attaching herself to me alone rendered me happy. 59905|3|1|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
538|It is a happiness to wonder; it is a happiness to dream. 59989|4|1|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

544|But within me is a pledge of that affection- ah, how little! 60235|1|14|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
545|–which thou didst feel for me, Morella. 60295|2|14|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
546|And when my spirit departs shall the child live–thy child and mine, Morella's. 60334|3|14|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
547|But thy days shall be days of sorrow–that sorrow which is the most lasting of impressions, as the cypress is the most enduring of trees. 60412|4|14|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
548|For the hours of thy happiness are over and joy is not gathered twice in a life, as the roses of Paestum twice in a year. 60548|5|14|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
549|"Thou shalt no longer, then, play the Teian with time, but, being ignorant of the myrtle and the vine, thou shalt bear about with thee thy shroud on the earth, as do the Moslemin at Mecca"". 60669"|6|14|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
550|"""Morella""! 60857"|0|15|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
551|"I cried, ""Morella! 60867"|1|15|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
552|"how knowest thou this""? 60885"|2|15|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
553|but she turned away her face upon the pillow and a slight tremor coming over her limbs, she thus died, and I heard her voice no more. 60908|3|15|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
554|Yet, as she had foretold, her child, to which in dying she had given birth, which breathed not until the mother breathed no more, her child, a daughter, lived. 61041|0|16|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
555|And she grew strangely in stature and intellect, and was the perfect resemblance of her who had departed, and I loved her with a love more fervent than I had believed it possible to feel for any denizen of earth. 61200|1|16|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
556|But, ere long the heaven of this pure affection became darkened, and gloom, and horror, and grief swept over it in clouds. 61412|0|17|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
557|I said the child grew strangely in stature and intelligence. 61534|1|17|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
558|Strange, indeed, was her rapid increase in bodily size, but terrible, oh! 61594|2|17|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
559|terrible were the tumultuous thoughts which crowded upon me while watching the development of her mental being. 61667|3|17|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
560|Could it be otherwise, when I daily discovered in the conceptions of the child the adult powers and faculties of the woman? 61778|4|17|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
561|when the lessons of experience fell from the lips of infancy? 61901|5|17|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
562|and when the wisdom or the passions of maturity I found hourly gleaming from its full and speculative eye? 61962|6|17|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
563|When, I say, all this beeame evident to my appalled senses, when I could no longer hide it from my soul, nor throw it off from those perceptions which trembled to receive it, is it to be wondered at that suspicions, of a nature fearful and exciting, crept in upon my spirit, or that my thoughts fell back aghast upon the wild tales and thrilling theories of the entombed Morella? 62068|7|17|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
564|I snatched from the scrutiny of the world a being whom destiny compelled me to adore, and in the rigorous seclusion of my home, watched with an agonizing anxiety over all which concerned the beloved. 62447|8|17|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
565|And as years rolled away, and I gazed day after day upon her holy, and mild, and eloquent face, and poured over her maturing form, day after day did I discover new points of resemblance in the child to her mother, the melancholy and the dead. 62646|0|18|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
566|And hourly grew darker these shadows of similitude, and more full, and more definite, and more perplexing, and more hideously terrible in their aspect. 62888|1|18|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
567|For that her smile was like her mother's I could bear; but then I shuddered at its too perfect identity, that her eyes were like Morella's I could endure; but then they, too, often looked down into the depths of my soul with Morella's own intense and bewildering meaning. 63039|2|18|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
568|And in the contour of the high forehead, and in the ringlets of the silken hair, and in the wan fingers which buried themselves therein, and in the sad musical tones of her speech, and above all–oh, above all, in the phrases and expressions of the dead on the lips of the loved and the living, I found food for consuming thought and horror, for a worm that would not die. 63310|3|18|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
569|Thus passed away two lustra of her life, and as yet my daughter remained nameless upon the earth. 63681|0|19|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
570|"""My child,"" and ""my love,"" were the designations usually prompted by a father's affection, and the rigid seclusion of her days precluded all other intercourse. 63778"|1|19|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
571|What fiend spoke from the recesses of my soul, when amid those dim aisles, and in the silence of the night, I whispered within the ears of the holy man the syllables–Morella? 63937|10|19|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
572|"What more than fiend convulsed the features of my child, and overspread them with hues of death, as starting at that scarcely audible sound, she turned her glassy eyes from the earth to heaven, and falling prostrate on the black slabs of our ancestral vault, responded–""I am here""! 64111"|11|19|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
573|Morella's name died with her at her death. 64392|2|19|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
574|Of the mother I had never spoken to the daughter, it was impossible to speak. 64434|3|19|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
575|Indeed, during the brief period of her existence, the latter had received no impressions from the outward world, save such as might have been afforded by the narrow limits of her privacy. 64511|4|19|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
576|But at length the ceremony of baptism presented to my mind, in its unnerved and agitated condition, a present deliverance from the terrors of my destiny. 64698|5|19|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
577|And at the baptismal font I hesitated for a name. 64851|6|19|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
578|And many titles of the wise and beautiful, of old and modern times, of my own and foreign lands, came thronging to my lips, with many, many fair titles of the gentle, and the happy, and the good. 64900|7|19|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
579|What prompted me then to disturb the memory of the buried dead? 65095|8|19|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
580|What demon urged me to breathe that sound, which in its very recollection was wont to make ebb the purple blood in torrents from the temples to the heart? 65158|9|19|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
581|Morella's erudition was profound. 65312|0|2|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
582|As I hope to live, her talents were of no common order–her powers of mind were gigantic. 65345|1|2|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
583|I felt this, and, in many matters, became her pupil. 65433|2|2|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
584|I soon, however, found that, perhaps on account of her Presburg education, she placed before me a number of those mystical writings which are usually considered the mere dross of the early German literature. 65485|3|2|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
585|These, for what reason I could not imagine, were her favourite and constant study–and that in process of time they became my own, should be attributed to the simple but effectual influence of habit and example. 65692|4|2|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
586|Distinct, coldly, calmly distinct, fell those few simple sounds within my ear, and thence like molten lead rolled hissingly into my brain. 65902|0|20|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
587|Years–years may pass away, but the memory of that epoch never. 66040|1|20|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
588|Nor was I indeed ignorant of the flowers and the vine–but the hemlock and the cypress overshadowed me night and day. 66102|2|20|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
589|And I kept no reckoning of time or place, and the stars of my fate faded from heaven, and therefore the earth grew dark, and its figures passed by me like flitting shadows, and among them all I beheld only–Morella. 66218|3|20|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
590|The winds of the firmament breathed but one sound within my ears, and the ripples upon the sea murmured evermore–Morella. 66432|4|20|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
591|But she died; and with my own hands I bore her to the tomb; and I laughed with a long and bitter laugh as I found no traces of the first in the channel where I laid the second. 66553|5|20|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
592|–Morella. 66729|6|20|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
593|In all this, if I err not, my reason had little to do. 66738|0|3|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
594|My convictions, or I forget myself, were in no manner acted upon by the ideal, nor was any tincture of the mysticism which I read to be discovered, unless I am greatly mistaken, either in my deeds or in my thoughts. 66792|1|3|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
595|Persuaded of this, I abandoned myself implicitly to the guidance of my wife, and entered with an unflinching heart into the intricacies of her studies. 67007|2|3|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
596|And then–then, when poring over forbidden pages, I felt a forbidden spirit enkindling within me- would Morella place her cold hand upon my own, and rake up from the ashes of a dead philosophy some low, singular words, whose strange meaning burned themselves in upon my memory. 67158|3|3|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
597|And then, hour after hour, would I linger by her side, and dwell upon the music of her voice, until at length its melody was tainted with terror, and there fell a shadow upon my soul, and I grew pale, and shuddered inwardly at those too unearthly tones. 67434|4|3|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
598|And thus, joy suddenly faded into horror, and the most beautiful became the most hideous, as Hinnon became Ge-Henna. 67687|5|3|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
599|It is unnecessary to state the exact character of those disquisitions which, growing out of the volumes I have mentioned, formed, for so long a time, almost the sole conversation of Morella and myself. 67803|0|4|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
600|By the learned in what might be termed theological morality they will be readily conceived, and by the unlearned they would, at all events, be little understood. 68004|1|4|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
601|The wild Pantheism of Fichte; the modified Paliggenedia of the Pythagoreans; and, above all, the doctrines of Identity as urged by Schelling, were generally the points of discussion presenting the most of beauty to the imaginative Morella. 68165|2|4|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
602|That identity which is termed personal, Mr. Locke, I think, truly defines to consist in the saneness of rational being. 68404|3|4|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
603|And since by person we understand an intelligent essence having reason, and since there is a consciousness which always accompanies thinking, it is this which makes us all to be that which we call ourselves, thereby distinguishing us from other beings that think, and giving us our personal identity. 68523|4|4|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
604|But the principium indivduationis, the notion of that identity which at death is or is not lost for ever, was to me, at all times, a consideration of intense interest; not more from the perplexing and exciting nature of its consequences, than from the marked and agitated manner in which Morella mentioned them. 68823|5|4|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
605|But, indeed, the time had now arrived when the mystery of my wife's manner oppressed me as a spell. 69134|0|5|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
606|I could no longer bear the touch of her wan fingers, nor the low tone of her musical language, nor the lustre of her melancholy eyes. 69233|1|5|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
607|And she knew all this, but did not upbraid; she seemed conscious of my weakness or my folly, and, smiling, called it fate. 69366|2|5|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
608|She seemed also conscious of a cause, to me unknown, for the gradual alienation of my regard; but she gave me no hint or token of its nature. 69488|3|5|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
609|Yet was she woman, and pined away daily. 69629|4|5|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
610|In time the crimson spot settled steadily upon the cheek, and the blue veins upon the pale forehead became prominent; and one instant my nature melted into pity, but in, next I met the glance of her meaning eyes, and then my soul sickened and became giddy with the giddiness of one who gazes downward into some dreary and unfathomable abyss. 69669|5|5|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
611|Shall I then say that I longed with an earnest and consuming desire for the moment of Morella's decease? 70010|0|6|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
612|I did; but the fragile spirit clung to its tenement of clay for many days, for many weeks and irksome months, until my tortured nerves obtained the mastery over my mind, and I grew furious through delay, and, with the heart of a fiend, cursed the days and the hours and the bitter moments, which seemed to lengthen and lengthen as her gentle life declined, like shadows in the dying of the day. 70114|1|6|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
613|But one autumnal evening, when the winds lay still in heaven, Morella called me to her bedside. 70508|0|7|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
614|There was a dim mist over all the earth, and a warm glow upon the waters, and amid the rich October leaves of the forest, a rainbow from the firmament had surely fAllan. 70603|1|7|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
615|"""It is a day of days,"" she said, as I approached; ""a day of all days either to live or die. 70772"|0|8|Morella|1835-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

806|By late accounts from Rotterdam, that city seems to be in a high state of philosophical excitement. 80783|0|1|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
807|Indeed, phenomena have there occurred of a nature so completely unexpected–so entirely novel–so utterly at variance with preconceived opinions–as to leave no doubt on my mind that long ere this all Europe is in an uproar, all physics in a ferment, all reason and astronomy together by the ears. 80882|1|1|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
808|date), a vast crowd of people, for purposes not specifically mentioned, were assembled in the great square of the Exchange in the well-conditioned city of Rotterdam. 81176|2|1|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
809|The day was warm–unusually so for the season–there was hardly a breath of air stirring; and the multitude were in no bad humor at being now and then besprinkled with friendly showers of momentary duration, that fell from large white masses of cloud which chequered in a fitful manner the blue vault of the firmament. 81341|3|1|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
810|Nevertheless, about noon, a slight but remarkable agitation became apparent in the assembly: the clattering of ten thousand tongues succeeded; and, in an instant afterward, ten thousand faces were upturned toward the heavens, ten thousand pipes descended simultaneously from the corners of ten thousand mouths, and a shout, which could be compared to nothing but the roaring of Niagara, resounded long, loudly, and furiously, through all the environs of Rotterdam. 81657|4|1|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
811|It was late when I reached home, and I went immediately to bed. 82121|0|10|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
812|My mind, however, was too much occupied to sleep, and I lay the whole night buried in meditation. 82184|1|10|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
813|Arising early in the morning, and contriving again to escape the vigilance of my creditors, I repaired eagerly to the bookseller's stall, and laid out what little ready money I possessed, in the purchase of some volumes of Mechanics and Practical Astronomy. 82281|2|10|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
814|Having arrived at home safely with these, I devoted every spare moment to their perusal, and soon made such proficiency in studies of this nature as I thought sufficient for the execution of my plan. 82538|3|10|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
815|In the intervals of this period, I made every endeavor to conciliate the three creditors who had given me so much annoyance. 82737|4|10|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
816|In this I finally succeeded–partly by selling enough of my household furniture to satisfy a moiety of their claim, and partly by a promise of paying the balance upon completion of a little project which I told them I had in view, and for assistance in which I solicited their services. 82861|5|10|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
817|By these means–for they were ignorant men–I found little difficulty in gaining them over to my purpose. 83146|6|10|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
818|Matters being thus arranged, I contrived, by the aid of my wife and with the greatest secrecy and caution, to dispose of what property I had remaining, and to borrow, in small sums, under various pretences, and without paying any attention to my future means of repayment, no inconsiderable quantity of ready money. 83249|0|11|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
819|With the means thus accruing I proceeded to procure at intervals, cambric muslin, very fine, in pieces of twelve yards each; twine; a lot of the varnish of caoutchouc; a large and deep basket of wicker-work, made to order; and several other articles necessary in the construction and equipment of a balloon of extraordinary dimensions. 83564|1|11|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
820|This I directed my wife to make up as soon as possible, and gave her all requisite information as to the particular method of proceeding. 83899|2|11|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
821|In the meantime I worked up the twine into a net-work of sufficient dimensions; rigged it with a hoop and the necessary cords; bought a quadrant, a compass, a spy-glass, a common barometer with some important modifications, and two astronomical instruments not so generally known. 84036|3|11|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
822|I then took opportunities of conveying by night, to a retired situation east of Rotterdam, five iron-bound casks, to contain about fifty gallons each, and one of a larger size; six tinned ware tubes, three inches in diameter, properly shaped, and ten feet in length; a quantity of a particular metallic substance, or semi-metal, which I shall not name, and a dozen demijohns of a very common acid. 84316|4|11|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
823|The gas to be formed from these latter materials is a gas never yet generated by any other person than myself–or at least never applied to any similar purpose. 84713|5|11|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
824|The secret I would make no difficulty in disclosing, but that it of right belongs to a citizen of Nantz, in France, by whom it was conditionally communicated to myself. 84872|6|11|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
825|The same individual submitted to me, without being at all aware of my intentions, a method of constructing balloons from the membrane of a certain animal, through which substance any escape of gas was nearly an impossibility. 85040|7|11|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
826|I found it, however, altogether too expensive, and was not sure, upon the whole, whether cambric muslin with a coating of gum caoutchouc, was not equally as good. 85265|8|11|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
827|I mention this circumstance, because I think it probable that hereafter the individual in question may attempt a balloon ascension with the novel gas and material I have spoken of, and I do not wish to deprive him of the honor of a very singular invention. 85427|9|11|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
828|On the spot which I intended each of the smaller casks to occupy respectively during the inflation of the balloon, I privately dug a hole two feet deep; the holes forming in this manner a circle twenty-five feet in diameter. 85683|0|12|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
829|In the centre of this circle, being the station designed for the large cask, I also dug a hole three feet in depth. 85907|1|12|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
830|In each of the five smaller holes, I deposited a canister containing fifty pounds, and in the larger one a keg holding one hundred and fifty pounds, of cannon powder. 86022|2|12|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
831|These–the keg and canisters–I connected in a proper manner with covered trains; and having let into one of the canisters the end of about four feet of slow match, I covered up the hole, and placed the cask over it, leaving the other end of the match protruding about an inch, and barely visible beyond the cask. 86188|3|12|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
832|I then filled up the remaining holes, and placed the barrels over them in their destined situation. 86499|4|12|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
833|Besides the articles above enumerated, I conveyed to the depot, and there secreted, one of M. Grimm's improvements upon the apparatus for condensation of the atmospheric air. 86598|0|13|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
834|I found this machine, however, to require considerable alteration before it could be adapted to the purposes to which I intended making it applicable. 86772|1|13|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
835|But, with severe labor and unremitting perseverance, I at length met with entire success in all my preparations. 86922|2|13|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
836|My balloon was soon completed. 87034|3|13|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
837|It would contain more than forty thousand cubic feet of gas; would take me up easily, I calculated, with all my implements, and, if I managed rightly, with one hundred and seventy-five pounds of ballast into the bargain. 87064|4|13|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
838|It had received three coats of varnish, and I found the cambric muslin to answer all the purposes of silk itself, quite as strong and a good deal less expensive. 87284|5|13|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
839|Everything being now ready, I exacted from my wife an oath of secrecy in relation to all my actions from the day of my first visit to the bookseller's stall; and promising, on my part, to return as soon as circumstances would permit, I gave her what little money I had left, and bade her farewell. 87445|0|14|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
840|Indeed I had no fear on her account. 87742|1|14|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
841|She was what people call a notable woman, and could manage matters in the world without my assistance. 87778|2|14|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
842|I believe, to tell the truth, she always looked upon me as an idle boy, a mere make-weight, good for nothing but building castles in the air, and was rather glad to get rid of me. 87880|3|14|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
843|It was a dark night when I bade her good-bye, and taking with me, as aides-de-camp, the three creditors who had given me so much trouble, we carried the balloon, with the car and accoutrements, by a roundabout way, to the station where the other articles were deposited. 88059|4|14|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
844|We there found them all unmolested, and I proceeded immediately to business. 88329|5|14|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
845|It was the first of April. 88405|0|15|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
846|The night, as I said before, was dark; there was not a star to be seen; and a drizzling rain, falling at intervals, rendered us very uncomfortable. 88431|1|15|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
847|But my chief anxiety was concerning the balloon, which, in spite of the varnish with which it was defended, began to grow rather heavy with the moisture; the powder also was liable to damage. 88578|2|15|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
848|I therefore kept my three duns working with great diligence, pounding down ice around the central cask, and stirring the acid in the others. 88769|3|15|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
849|They did not cease, however, importuning me with questions as to what I intended to do with all this apparatus, and expressed much dissatisfaction at the terrible labor I made them undergo. 88909|4|15|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
850|They could not perceive, so they said, what good was likely to result from their getting wet to the skin, merely to take a part in such horrible incantations. 89098|5|15|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
851|I began to get uneasy, and worked away with all my might, for I verily believe the idiots supposed that I had entered into a compact with the devil, and that, in short, what I was now doing was nothing better than it should be. 89256|6|15|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
852|I was, therefore, in great fear of their leaving me altogether. 89483|7|15|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
853|I contrived, however, to pacify them by promises of payment of all scores in full, as soon as I could bring the present business to a termination. 89546|8|15|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
854|To these speeches they gave, of course, their own interpretation; fancying, no doubt, that at all events I should come into possession of vast quantities of ready money; and provided I paid them all I owed, and a trifle more, in consideration of their services, I dare say they cared very little what became of either my soul or my carcass. 89692|9|15|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
855|In about four hours and a half I found the balloon sufficiently inflated. 90032|0|16|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
856|I attached the car, therefore, and put all my implements in it–not forgetting the condensing apparatus, a copious supply of water, and a large quantity of provisions, such as pemmican, in which much nutriment is contained in comparatively little bulk. 90105|1|16|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
857|I also secured in the car a pair of pigeons and a cat. 90356|2|16|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
858|It was now nearly daybreak, and I thought it high time to take my departure. 90410|3|16|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
859|Dropping a lighted cigar on the ground, as if by accident, I took the opportunity, in stooping to pick it up, of igniting privately the piece of slow match, whose end, as I said before, protruded a very little beyond the lower rim of one of the smaller casks. 90486|4|16|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
860|This manoeuvre was totally unperceived on the part of the three duns; and, jumping into the car, I immediately cut the single cord which held me to the earth, and was pleased to find that I shot upward, carrying with all ease one hundred and seventy-five pounds of leaden ballast, and able to have carried up as many more. 90745|5|16|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
861|Scarcely, however, had I attained the height of fifty yards, when, roaring and rumbling up after me in the most horrible and tumultuous manner, came so dense a hurricane of fire, and smoke, and sulphur, and legs and arms, and gravel, and burning wood, and blazing metal, that my very heart sunk within me, and I fell down in the bottom of the car, trembling with unmitigated terror. 91067|0|17|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
862|Indeed, I now perceived that I had entirely overdone the business, and that the main consequences of the shock were yet to be experienced. 91449|1|17|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
863|Accordingly, in less than a second, I felt all the blood in my body rushing to my temples, and immediately thereupon, a concussion, which I shall never forget, burst abruptly through the night and seemed to rip the very firmament asunder. 91587|2|17|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
864|When I afterward had time for reflection, I did not fail to attribute the extreme violence of the explosion, as regarded myself, to its proper cause–my situation directly above it, and in the line of its greatest power. 91825|3|17|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
865|But at the time, I thought only of preserving my life. 92044|4|17|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
866|The balloon at first collapsed, then furiously expanded, then whirled round and round with horrible velocity, and finally, reeling and staggering like a drunken man, hurled me with great force over the rim of the car, and left me dangling, at a terrific height, with my head downward, and my face outwards, by a piece of slender cord about three feet in length, which hung accidentally through a crevice near the bottom of the wicker-work, and in which, as I fell, my left foot became most providentially entangled. 92098|5|17|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
867|It is impossible–utterly impossible–to form any adequate idea of the horror of my situation. 92613|6|17|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
868|I gasped convulsively for breath–a shudder resembling a fit of the ague agitated every nerve and muscle of my frame–I felt my eyes starting from their sockets–a horrible nausea overwhelmed me–and at length I fainted away. 92705|7|17|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
869|How long I remained in this state it is impossible to say. 92926|0|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
870|It must, however, have been no inconsiderable time, for when I partially recovered the sense of existence, I found the day breaking, the balloon at a prodigious height over a wilderness of ocean, and not a trace of land to be discovered far and wide within the limits of the vast horizon. 92984|1|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
871|If I felt any emotion at all, it was a kind of chuckling satisfaction at the cleverness I was about to display in extricating myself from this dilemma; and I never, for a moment, looked upon my ultimate safety as a question susceptible of doubt. 93272|10|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
872|For a few minutes I remained wrapped in the profoundest meditation. 93517|11|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
873|I have a distinct recollection of frequently compressing my lips, putting my forefinger to the side of my nose, and making use of other gesticulations and grimaces common to men who, at ease in their arm-chairs, meditate upon matters of intricacy or importance. 93584|12|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
874|Having, as I thought, sufficiently collected my ideas, I now, with great caution and deliberation, put my hands behind my back, and unfastened the large iron buckle which belonged to the waistband of my inexpressibles. 93845|13|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
875|This buckle had three teeth, which, being somewhat rusty, turned with great difficulty on their axis. 94063|14|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
876|I brought them, however, after some trouble, at right angles to the body of the buckle, and was glad to find them remain firm in that position. 94164|15|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
877|Holding the instrument thus obtained within my teeth, I now proceeded to untie the knot of my cravat. 94307|16|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
878|I had to rest several times before I could accomplish this manoeuvre, but it was at length accomplished. 94408|17|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
879|To one end of the cravat I then made fast the buckle, and the other end I tied, for greater security, tightly around my wrist. 94512|18|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
880|Drawing now my body upwards, with a prodigious exertion of muscular force, I succeeded, at the very first trial, in throwing the buckle over the car, and entangling it, as I had anticipated, in the circular rim of the wicker-work. 94638|19|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
881|My sensations, however, upon thus recovering, were by no means so rife with agony as might have been anticipated. 94868|2|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
882|Indeed, there was much of incipient madness in the calm survey which I began to take of my situation. 94981|3|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
883|I drew up to my eyes each of my hands, one after the other, and wondered what occurrence could have given rise to the swelling of the veins, and the horrible blackness of the fingemails. 95082|4|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
884|I afterward carefully examined my head, shaking it repeatedly, and feeling it with minute attention, until I succeeded in satisfying myself that it was not, as I had more than half suspected, larger than my balloon. 95268|5|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
885|Then, in a knowing manner, I felt in both my breeches pockets, and, missing therefrom a set of tablets and a toothpick case, endeavored to account for their disappearance, and not being able to do so, felt inexpressibly chagrined. 95483|6|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
886|It now occurred to me that I suffered great uneasiness in the joint of my left ankle, and a dim consciousness of my situation began to glimmer through my mind. 95713|7|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
887|But, strange to say! 95872|8|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
888|I was neither astonished nor horror-stricken. 95892|9|18|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
889|My body was now inclined towards the side of the car, at an angle of about forty-five degrees; but it must not be understood that I was therefore only forty-five degrees below the perpendicular. 95937|0|19|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
890|So far from it, I still lay nearly level with the plane of the horizon; for the change of situation which I had acquired, had forced the bottom of the car considerably outwards from my position, which was accordingly one of the most imminent and deadly peril. 96131|1|19|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
891|It should be remembered, however, that when I fell in the first instance, from the car, if I had fAllan with my face turned toward the balloon, instead of turned outwardly from it, as it actually was; or if, in the second place, the cord by which I was suspended had chanced to hang over the upper edge, instead of through a crevice near the bottom of the car,–I say it may be readily conceived that, in either of these supposed cases, I should have been unable to accomplish even as much as I had now accomplished, and the wonderful adventures of Hans Phaall would have been utterly lost to posterity, I had therefore every reason to be grateful; although, in point of fact, I was still too stupid to be anything at all, and hung for, perhaps, a quarter of an hour in that extraordinary manner, without making the slightest farther exertion whatsoever, and in a singularly tranquil state of idiotic enjoyment. 96390|2|19|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
892|But this feeling did not fail to die rapidly away, and thereunto succeeded horror, and dismay, and a chilling sense of utter helplessness and ruin. 97300|3|19|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
893|In fact, the blood so long accumulating in the vessels of my head and throat, and which had hitherto buoyed up my spirits with madness and delirium, had now begun to retire within their proper channels, and the distinctness which was thus added to my perception of the danger, merely served to deprive me of the self-possession and courage to encounter it. 97447|4|19|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
894|But this weakness was, luckily for me, of no very long duration. 97803|5|19|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
895|In good time came to my rescue the spirit of despair, and, with frantic cries and struggles, I jerked my way bodily upwards, till at length, clutching with a vise-like grip the long-desired rim, I writhed my person over it, and fell headlong and shuddering within the car. 97867|6|19|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
896|The origin of this hubbub soon became sufficiently evident. 98139|0|2|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
897|From behind the huge bulk of one of those sharply-defined masses of cloud already mentioned, was seen slowly to emerge into an open area of blue space, a queer, heterogeneous, but apparently solid substance, so oddly shaped, so whimsically put together, as not to be in any manner comprehended, and never to be sufficiently admired, by the host of sturdy burghers who stood open-mouthed below. 98198|1|2|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
898|What could it be? 98591|2|2|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
899|In the name of all the vrows and devils in Rotterdam, what could it possibly portend? 98608|3|2|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
900|No one knew, no one could imagine; no one–not even the burgomaster Mynheer Superbus Von Underduk–had the slightest clew by which to unravel the mystery; so, as nothing more reasonable could be done, every one to a man replaced his pipe carefully in the corner of his mouth, and cocking up his right eye towards the phenomenon, puffed, paused, waddled about, and grunted significantly- then waddled back, grunted, paused, and finally–puffed again. 98693|4|2|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
901|It was not until some time afterward that I recovered myself sufficiently to attend to the ordinary cares of the balloon. 99139|0|20|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
902|I then, however, examined it with attention, and found it, to my great relief, uninjured. 99260|1|20|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
903|My implements were all safe, and, fortunately, I had lost neither ballast nor provisions. 99349|2|20|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
904|Indeed, I had so well secured them in their places, that such an accident was entirely out of the question. 99438|3|20|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
905|Looking at my watch, I found it six o'clock. 99545|4|20|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
906|I was still rapidly ascending, and my barometer gave a present altitude of three and three-quarter miles. 99589|5|20|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
907|Immediately beneath me in the ocean, lay a small black object, slightly oblong in shape, seemingly about the size, and in every way bearing a great resemblance to one of those childish toys called a domino. 99694|6|20|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
908|Bringing my telescope to bear upon it, I plainly discerned it to be a British ninety four-gun ship, close-hauled, and pitching heavily in the sea with her head to the W.S.W. Besides this ship, I saw nothing but the ocean and the sky, and the sun, which had long arisen. 99900|7|20|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
909|It is now high time that I should explain to your Excellencies the object of my perilous voyage. 100169|0|21|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
910|Your Excellencies will bear in mind that distressed circumstances in Rotterdam had at length driven me to the resolution of committing suicide. 100265|1|21|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
911|It was not, however, that to life itself I had any, positive disgust, but that I was harassed beyond endurance by the adventitious miseries attending my situation. 100408|2|21|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
912|In this state of mind, wishing to live, yet wearied with life, the treatise at the stall of the bookseller opened a resource to my imagination. 100571|3|21|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
913|I then finally made up my mind. 100714|4|21|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
914|I determined to depart, yet live–to leave the world, yet continue to exist–in short, to drop enigmas, I resolved, let what would ensue, to force a passage, if I could, to the moon. 100745|5|21|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
915|Now, lest I should be supposed more of a madman than I actually am, I will detail, as well as I am able, the considerations which led me to believe that an achievement of this nature, although without doubt difficult, and incontestably full of danger, was not absolutely, to a bold spirit, beyond the confines of the possible. 100925|6|21|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
916|The moon's actual distance from the earth was the first thing to be attended to. 101251|0|22|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
917|Now, the mean or average interval between the centres of the two planets is 59. 101331|1|22|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
918|There were, however, many particulars inducing me to believe that my average rate of travelling might possibly very much exceed that of thirty miles per hour, and, as these considerations did not fail to make a deep impression upon my mind, I will mention them more fully hereafter. 101410|10|22|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
919|9643 of the earth's equatorial radii, or only about 237,000 miles. 101692|2|22|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
920|I say the mean or average interval. 101758|3|22|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
921|But it must be borne in mind that the form of the moon's orbit being an ellipse of eccentricity amounting to no less than 0. 101793|4|22|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
922|05484 of the major semi-axis of the ellipse itself, and the earth's centre being situated in its focus, if I could, in any manner, contrive to meet the moon, as it were, in its perigee, the above mentioned distance would be materially diminished. 101917|5|22|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
923|But, to say nothing at present of this possibility, it was very certain that, at all events, from the 237,000 miles I would have to deduct the radius of the earth, say 4,000, and the radius of the moon, say 1080, in all 5,080, leaving an actual interval to be traversed, under average circumstances, of 231,920 miles. 102163|6|22|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
924|Now this, I reflected, was no very extraordinary distance. 102480|7|22|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
925|Travelling on land has been repeatedly accomplished at the rate of thirty miles per hour, and indeed a much greater speed may be anticipated. 102538|8|22|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
926|But even at this velocity, it would take me no more than 322 days to reach the surface of the moon. 102679|9|22|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
927|The next point to be regarded was a matter of far greater importance. 102778|0|23|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
928|From indications afforded by the barometer, we find that, in ascensions from the surface of the earth we have, at the height of 1,000 feet, left below us about one-thirtieth of the entire mass of atmospheric air, that at 10,600 we have ascended through nearly one-third; and that at 18,000, which is not far from the elevation of Cotopaxi, we have surmounted one-half the material, or, at all events, one-half the ponderable, body of air incumbent upon our globe. 102847|1|23|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
929|It is also calculated that at an altitude not exceeding the hundredth part of the earth's diameter–that is, not exceeding eighty miles–the rarefaction would be so excessive that animal life could in no manner be sustained, and, moreover, that the most delicate means we possess of ascertaining the presence of the atmosphere would be inadequate to assure us of its existence. 103310|2|23|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
930|But I did not fail to perceive that these latter calculations are founded altogether on our experimental knowledge of the properties of air, and the mechanical laws regulating its dilation and compression, in what may be called, comparatively speaking, the immediate vicinity of the earth itself; and, at the same time, it is taken for granted that animal life is and must be essentially incapable of modification at any given unattainable distance from the surface. 103685|3|23|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
931|Now, all such reasoning and from such data must, of course, be simply analogical. 104151|4|23|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
932|The greatest height ever reached by man was that of 25,000 feet, attained in the aeronautic expedition of Messieurs Gay-Lussac and Biot. 104232|5|23|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
933|This is a moderate altitude, even when compared with the eighty miles in question; and I could not help thinking that the subject admitted room for doubt and great latitude for speculation. 104368|6|23|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
934|But, in point of fact, an ascension being made to any given altitude, the ponderable quantity of air surmounted in any farther ascension is by no means in proportion to the additional height ascended (as may be plainly seen from what has been stated before), but in a ratio constantly decreasing. 104557|0|24|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
935|It is therefore evident that, ascend as high as we may, we cannot, literally speaking, arrive at a limit beyond which no atmosphere is to be found. 104853|1|24|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
936|It must exist, I argued; although it may exist in a state of infinite rarefaction. 105000|2|24|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
937|On the other hand, I was aware that arguments have not been wanting to prove the existence of a real and definite limit to the atmosphere, beyond which there is absolutely no air whatsoever. 105082|0|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
938|But a circumstance which has been left out of view by those who contend for such a limit seemed to me, although no positive refutation of their creed, still a point worthy very serious investigation. 105272|1|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
939|The lenticular-shaped phenomenon, also called the zodiacal light, was a matter worthy of attention. 105471|10|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
940|This radiance, so apparent in the tropics, and which cannot be mistaken for any meteoric lustre, extends from the horizon obliquely upward, and follows generally the direction of the sun's equator. 105570|11|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
941|It appeared to me evidently in the nature of a rare atmosphere extending from the sun outward, beyond the orbit of Venus at least, and I believed indefinitely farther. 105767|12|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
942|* Indeed, this medium I could not suppose confined to the path of the comet's ellipse, or to the immediate neighborhood of the sun. 105934|13|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
943|It was easy, on the contrary, to imagine it pervading the entire regions of our planetary system, condensed into what we call atmosphere at the planets themselves, and perhaps at some of them modified by considerations, so to speak, purely geological. 106065|14|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
944|On comparing the intervals between the successive arrivals of Encke's comet at its perihelion, after giving credit, in the most exact manner, for all the disturbances due to the attractions of the planets, it appears that the periods are gradually diminishing; that is to say, the major axis of the comet's ellipse is growing shorter, in a slow but perfectly regular decrease. 106316|2|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
945|Now, this is precisely what ought to be the case, if we suppose a resistance experienced from the comet from an extremely rare ethereal medium pervading the regions of its orbit. 106692|3|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
946|For it is evident that such a medium must, in retarding the comet's velocity, increase its centripetal, by weakening its centrifugal force. 106870|4|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
947|In other words, the sun's attraction would be constantly attaining greater power, and the comet would be drawn nearer at every revolution. 107009|5|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
948|Indeed, there is no other way of accounting for the variation in question. 107147|6|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
949|But again. 107221|7|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
950|The real diameter of the same comet's nebulosity is observed to contract rapidly as it approaches the sun, and dilate with equal rapidity in its departure towards its aphelion. 107231|8|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
951|Was I not justifiable in supposing with M. Valz, that this apparent condensation of volume has its origin in the compression of the same ethereal medium I have spoken of before, and which is only denser in proportion to its solar vicinity? 107407|9|25|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
952|*The zodiacal light is probably what the ancients called Trabes. 107646|0|26|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

956|26. 107760|4|26|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
957|Having adopted this view of the subject, I had little further hesitation. 107763|0|27|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
958|Granting that on my passage I should meet with atmosphere essentially the same as at the surface of the earth, I conceived that, by means of the very ingenious apparatus of M. Grimm, I should readily be enabled to condense it in sufficient quantity for the purposes of respiration. 107836|1|27|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
959|This would remove the chief obstacle in a journey to the moon. 108117|2|27|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
960|I had indeed spent some money and great labor in adapting the apparatus to the object intended, and confidently looked forward to its successful application, if I could manage to complete the voyage within any reasonable period. 108179|3|27|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
961|This brings me back to the rate at which it might be possible to travel. 108407|4|27|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
962|It is true that balloons, in the first stage of their ascensions from the earth, are known to rise with a velocity comparatively moderate. 108479|0|28|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
963|Now, the power of elevation lies altogether in the superior lightness of the gas in the balloon compared with the atmospheric air; and, at first sight, it does not appear probable that, as the balloon acquires altitude, and consequently arrives successively in atmospheric strata of densities rapidly diminishing–I say, it does not appear at all reasonable that, in this its progress upwards, the original velocity should be accelerated. 108617|1|28|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
964|On the other hand, I was not aware that, in any recorded ascension, a diminution was apparent in the absolute rate of ascent; although such should have been the case, if on account of nothing else, on account of the escape of gas through balloons ill-constructed, and varnished with no better material than the ordinary varnish. 109054|2|28|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
965|It seemed, therefore, that the effect of such escape was only sufficient to counterbalance the effect of some accelerating power. 109382|3|28|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
966|I now considered that, provided in my passage I found the medium I had imagined, and provided that it should prove to be actually and essentially what we denominate atmospheric air, it could make comparatively little difference at what extreme state of rarefaction I should discover it–that is to say, in regard to my power of ascending–for the gas in the balloon would not only be itself subject to rarefaction partially similar (in proportion to the occurrence of which, I could suffer an escape of so much as would be requisite to prevent explosion), but, being what it was, would, at all events, continue specifically lighter than any compound whatever of mere nitrogen and oxygen. 109511|4|28|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
967|In the meantime, the force of gravitation would be constantly diminishing, in proportion to the squares of the distances, and thus, with a velocity prodigiously accelerating, I should at length arrive in those distant regions where the force of the earth's attraction would be superseded by that of the moon. 110196|5|28|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
968|In accordance with these ideas, I did not think it worth while to encumber myself with more provisions than would be sufficient for a period of forty days. 110504|6|28|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
969|There was still, however, another difficulty, which occasioned me some little disquietude. 110659|0|29|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
970|It has been observed, that, in balloon ascensions to any considerable height, besides the pain attending respiration, great uneasiness is experienced about the head and body, often accompanied with bleeding at the nose, and other symptoms of an alarming kind, and growing more and more inconvenient in proportion to the altitude attained. 110749|1|29|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
971|* This was a reflection of a nature somewhat startling. 111087|2|29|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
972|Was it not probable that these symptoms would increase indefinitely, or at least until terminated by death itself? 111142|3|29|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
973|I finally thought not. 111256|4|29|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
974|Their origin was to be looked for in the progressive removal of the customary atmospheric pressure upon the surface of the body, and consequent distention of the superficial blood-vessels–not in any positive disorganization of the animal system, as in the case of difficulty in breathing, where the atmospheric density is chemically insufficient for the due renovation of blood in a ventricle of the heart. 111278|5|29|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
975|Unless for default of this renovation, I could see no reason, therefore, why life could not be sustained even in a vacuum; for the expansion and compression of chest, commonly called breathing, is action purely muscular, and the cause, not the effect, of respiration. 111684|6|29|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
976|In a word, I conceived that, as the body should become habituated to the want of atmospheric pressure, the sensations of pain would gradually diminish–and to endure them while they continued, I relied with confidence upon the iron hardihood of my constitution. 111951|7|29|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
977|In the meantime, however, lower and still lower toward the goodly city, came the object of so much curiosity, and the cause of so much smoke. 112211|0|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
978|In a very few minutes it arrived near enough to be accurately discerned. 112352|1|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
979|But still worse. 112424|10|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
980|Suspended by blue ribbons to the end of this fantastic machine, there hung, by way of car, an enormous drab beaver bat, with a brim superlatively broad, and a hemispherical crown with a black band and a silver buckle. 112440|11|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
981|It is, however, somewhat remarkable that many citizens of Rotterdam swore to having seen the same hat repeatedly before; and indeed the whole assembly seemed to regard it with eyes of familiarity; while the vrow Grettel Phaall, upon sight of it, uttered an exclamation of joyful surprise, and declared it to be the identical hat of her good man himself. 112657|12|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
982|Now this was a circumstance the more to be observed, as Phaall, with three companions, had actually disappeared from Rotterdam about five years before, in a very sudden and unaccountable manner, and up to the date of this narrative all attempts had failed of obtaining any intelligence concerning them whatsoever. 113010|13|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
983|To be sure, some bones which were thought to be human, mixed up with a quantity of odd-looking rubbish, had been lately discovered in a retired situation to the east of Rotterdam, and some people went so far as to imagine that in this spot a foul murder had been committed, and that the sufferers were in all probability Hans Phaall and his associates. 113323|14|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
984|But to return. 113675|15|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
985|It appeared to be–yes! 113689|2|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
986|it was undoubtedly a species of balloon; but surely no such balloon had ever been seen in Rotterdam before. 113711|3|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
987|For who, let me ask, ever heard of a balloon manufactured entirely of dirty newspapers? 113818|4|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
988|No man in Holland certainly; yet here, under the very noses of the people, or rather at some distance above their noses was the identical thing in question, and composed, I have it on the best authority, of the precise material which no one had ever before known to be used for a similar purpose. 113905|5|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
989|It was an egregious insult to the good sense of the burghers of Rotterdam. 114201|6|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
990|As to the shape of the phenomenon, it was even still more reprehensible. 114275|7|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
991|Being little or nothing better than a huge foolscap turned upside down. 114347|8|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
992|And this similitude was regarded as by no means lessened when, upon nearer inspection, there was perceived a large tassel depending from its apex, and, around the upper rim or base of the cone, a circle of little instruments, resembling sheep-bells, which kept up a continual tinkling to the tune of Betty Martin. 114418|9|3|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
993|*Since the original publication of Hans Phaall, I find that Mr. Green, of Nassau balloon notoriety, and other late aeronauts, deny the assertions of Humboldt, in this respect, and speak of a decreasing inconvenience,–precisely in accordance with the theory here urged in a mere spirit of banter. 114731|0|30|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
994|Thus, may it please your Excellencies, I have detailed some, though by no means all, the considerations which led me to form the project of a lunar voyage. 115026|0|31|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
995|I shall now proceed to lay before you the result of an attempt so apparently audacious in conception, and, at all events, so utterly unparalleled in the annals of mankind. 115181|1|31|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
996|Having attained the altitude before mentioned, that is to say three miles and three-quarters, I threw out from the car a quantity of feathers, and found that I still ascended with sufficient rapidity; there was, therefore, no necessity for discharging any ballast. 115352|0|32|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
997|I was glad of this, for I wished to retain with me as much weight as I could carry, for reasons which will be explained in the sequel. 115616|1|32|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
998|I as yet suffered no bodily inconvenience, breathing with great freedom, and feeling no pain whatever in the head. 115750|2|32|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
999|The cat was lying very demurely upon my coat, which I had taken off, and eyeing the pigeons with an air of nonchalance. 115864|3|32|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1000|These latter being tied by the leg, to prevent their escape, were busily employed in picking up some grains of rice scattered for them in the bottom of the car. 115983|4|32|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1001|At twenty minutes past six o'clock, the barometer showed an elevation of 26,400 feet, or five miles to a fraction. 116143|0|33|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1002|The prospect seemed unbounded. 116257|1|33|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1003|The cat and pigeons seemed to suffer no inconvenience whatsoever. 116287|10|33|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1004|Indeed, it is very easily calculated by means of spherical geometry, what a great extent of the earth's area I beheld. 116352|2|33|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1005|The convex surface of any segment of a sphere is, to the entire surface of the sphere itself, as the versed sine of the segment to the diameter of the sphere. 116470|3|33|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1006|Now, in my case, the versed sine–that is to say, the thickness of the segment beneath me–was about equal to my elevation, or the elevation of the point of sight above the surface. 116628|4|33|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1007|"""As five miles, then, to eight thousand,"" would express the proportion of the earth's area seen by me. 116807"|5|33|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1008|In other words, I beheld as much as a sixteen-hundredth part of the whole surface of the globe. 116909|6|33|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1009|The sea appeared unruffled as a mirror, although, by means of the spy-glass, I could perceive it to be in a state of violent agitation. 117004|7|33|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1010|The ship was no longer visible, having drifted away, apparently to the eastward. 117139|8|33|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1011|I now began to experience, at intervals, severe pain in the head, especially about the ears–still, however, breathing with tolerable freedom. 117219|9|33|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1012|At twenty minutes before seven, the balloon entered a long series of dense cloud, which put me to great trouble, by damaging my condensing apparatus and wetting me to the skin. 117360|0|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1013|This was, to be sure, a singular recontre, for I had not believed it possible that a cloud of this nature could be sustained at so great an elevation. 117536|1|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1014|Had the balloon remained a very short while longer within the cloud–that is to say–had not the inconvenience of getting wet, determined me to discharge the ballast, inevitable ruin would have been the consequence. 117686|10|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1015|Such perils, although little considered, are perhaps the greatest which must be encountered in balloons. 117899|11|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1016|I had by this time, however, attained too great an elevation to be any longer uneasy on this head. 118003|12|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1017|I thought it best, however, to throw out two five-pound pieces of ballast, reserving still a weight of one hundred and sixty-five pounds. 118101|2|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1018|Upon so doing, I soon rose above the difficulty, and perceived immediately, that I had obtained a great increase in my rate of ascent. 118238|3|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1019|In a few seconds after my leaving the cloud, a flash of vivid lightning shot from one end of it to the other, and caused it to kindle up, throughout its vast extent, like a mass of ignited and glowing charcoal. 118372|4|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1020|This, it must be remembered, was in the broad light of day. 118582|5|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1021|No fancy may picture the sublimity which might have been exhibited by a similar phenomenon taking place amid the darkness of the night. 118641|6|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1022|Hell itself might have been found a fitting image. 118776|7|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1023|Even as it was, my hair stood on end, while I gazed afar down within the yawning abysses, letting imagination descend, as it were, and stalk about in the strange vaulted halls, and ruddy gulfs, and red ghastly chasms of the hideous and unfathomable fire. 118826|8|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1024|I had indeed made a narrow escape. 119080|9|34|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1025|I was now rising rapidly, and by seven o'clock the barometer indicated an altitude of no less than nine miles and a half. 119114|0|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1026|I began to find great difficulty in drawing my breath. 119235|1|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1027|I now too late discovered the great rashness of which I had been guilty in discharging the ballast, and my agitation was excessive. 119289|10|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1028|I anticipated nothing less than death, and death in a few minutes. 119420|11|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1029|The physical suffering I underwent contributed also to render me nearly incapable of making any exertion for the preservation of my life. 119486|12|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1030|I had, indeed, little power of reflection left, and the violence of the pain in my head seemed to be greatly on the increase. 119623|13|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1031|Thus I found that my senses would shortly give way altogether, and I had already clutched one of the valve ropes with the view of attempting a descent, when the recollection of the trick I had played the three creditors, and the possible consequences to myself, should I return, operated to deter me for the moment. 119748|14|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1032|I lay down in the bottom of the car, and endeavored to collect my faculties. 120063|15|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1033|In this I so far succeeded as to determine upon the experiment of losing blood. 120139|16|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1034|Having no lancet, however, I was constrained to perform the operation in the best manner I was able, and finally succeeded in opening a vein in my right arm, with the blade of my penknife. 120218|17|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1035|The blood had hardly commenced flowing when I experienced a sensible relief, and by the time I had lost about half a moderate basin full, most of the worst symptoms had abandoned me entirely. 120406|18|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1036|I nevertheless did not think it expedient to attempt getting on my feet immediately; but, having tied up my arm as well as I could, I lay still for about a quarter of an hour. 120597|19|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1037|My head, too, was excessively painful; and, having felt for some time a moisture about my cheeks, I at length discovered it to be blood, which was oozing quite fast from the drums of my ears. 120772|2|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1038|At the end of this time I arose, and found myself freer from absolute pain of any kind than I had been during the last hour and a quarter of my ascension. 120963|20|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1039|The difficulty of breathing, however, was diminished in a very slight degree, and I found that it would soon be positively necessary to make use of my condenser. 121117|21|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1040|In the meantime, looking toward the cat, who was again snugly stowed away upon my coat, I discovered to my infinite surprise, that she had taken the opportunity of my indisposition to bring into light a litter of three little kittens. 121278|22|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1041|This was an addition to the number of passengers on my part altogether unexpected; but I was pleased at the occurrence. 121512|23|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1042|It would afford me a chance of bringing to a kind of test the truth of a surmise, which, more than anything else, had influenced me in attempting this ascension. 121631|24|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1043|I had imagined that the habitual endurance of the atmospheric pressure at the surface of the earth was the cause, or nearly so, of the pain attending animal existence at a distance above the surface. 121792|25|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1044|Should the kittens be found to suffer uneasiness in an equal degree with their mother, I must consider my theory in fault, but a failure to do so I should look upon as a strong confirmation of my idea. 121991|26|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1045|My eyes, also, gave me great uneasiness. 122192|3|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1046|Upon passing the hand over them they seemed to have protruded from their sockets in no inconsiderable degree; and all objects in the car, and even the balloon itself, appeared distorted to my vision. 122232|4|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1047|These symptoms were more than I had expected, and occasioned me some alarm. 122431|5|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1048|At this juncture, very imprudently, and without consideration, I threw out from the car three five-pound pieces of ballast. 122506|6|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1049|The accelerated rate of ascent thus obtained, carried me too rapidly, and without sufficient gradation, into a highly rarefied stratum of the atmosphere, and the result had nearly proved fatal to my expedition and to myself. 122629|7|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1050|I was suddenly seized with a spasm which lasted for more than five minutes, and even when this, in a measure, ceased, I could catch my breath only at long intervals, and in a gasping manner–bleeding all the while copiously at the nose and ears, and even slightly at the eyes. 122853|8|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1051|The pigeons appeared distressed in the extreme, and struggled to escape; while the cat mewed piteously, and, with her tongue hanging out of her mouth, staggered to and fro in the car as if under the influence of poison. 123128|9|35|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1052|By eight o'clock I had actually attained an elevation of seventeen miles above the surface of the earth. 123347|0|36|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1053|Thus it seemed to me evident that my rate of ascent was not only on the increase, but that the progression would have been apparent in a slight degree even had I not discharged the ballast which I did. 123451|1|36|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1054|The pains in my head and ears returned, at intervals, with violence, and I still continued to bleed occasionally at the nose; but, upon the whole, I suffered much less than might have been expected. 123652|2|36|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1055|I breathed, however, at every moment, with more and more difficulty, and each inhalation was attended with a troublesome spasmodic action of the chest. 123850|3|36|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1056|I now unpacked the condensing apparatus, and got it ready for immediate use. 124001|4|36|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1057|The view of the earth, at this period of my ascension, was beautiful indeed. 124077|0|37|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1058|To the westward, the northward, and the southward, as far as I could see, lay a boundless sheet of apparently unruffled ocean, which every moment gained a deeper and a deeper tint of blue and began already to assume a slight appearance of convexity. 124153|1|37|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1059|At a vast distance to the eastward, although perfectly discernible, extended the islands of Great Britain, the entire Atlantic coasts of France and Spain, with a small portion of the northern part of the continent of Africa. 124402|2|37|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1060|Of individual edifices not a trace could be discovered, and the proudest cities of mankind had utterly faded away from the face of the earth. 124626|3|37|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1061|From the rock of Gibraltar, now dwindled into a dim speck, the dark Mediterranean sea, dotted with shining islands as the heaven is dotted with stars, spread itself out to the eastward as far as my vision extended, until its entire mass of waters seemed at length to tumble headlong over the abyss of the horizon, and I found myself listening on tiptoe for the echoes of the mighty cataract. 124767|4|37|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1062|Overhead, the sky was of a jetty black, and the stars were brilliantly visible. 125158|5|37|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1063|The pigeons about this time seeming to undergo much suffering, I determined upon giving them their liberty. 125237|0|38|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1064|I first untied one of them, a beautiful gray-mottled pigeon, and placed him upon the rim of the wicker-work. 125344|1|38|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1065|Her kittens were quite lively, and so far evinced not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever. 125452|10|38|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1066|He appeared extremely uneasy, looking anxiously around him, fluttering his wings, and making a loud cooing noise, but could not be persuaded to trust himself from off the car. 125552|2|38|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1067|I took him up at last, and threw him to about half a dozen yards from the balloon. 125727|3|38|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1068|He made, however, no attempt to descend as I had expected, but struggled with great vehemence to get back, uttering at the same time very shrill and piercing cries. 125809|4|38|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1069|He at length succeeded in regaining his former station on the rim, but had hardly done so when his head dropped upon his breast, and be fell dead within the car. 125973|5|38|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1070|The other one did not prove so unfortunate. 126134|6|38|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1071|To prevent his following the example of his companion, and accomplishing a return, I threw him downward with all my force, and was pleased to find him continue his descent, with great velocity, making use of his wings with ease, and in a perfectly natural manner. 126177|7|38|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1072|In a very short time he was out of sight, and I have no doubt he reached home in safety. 126440|8|38|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1073|Puss, who seemed in a great measure recovered from her illness, now made a hearty meal of the dead bird and then went to sleep with much apparent satisfaction. 126528|9|38|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1074|At a quarter-past eight, being no longer able to draw breath without the most intolerable pain, I proceeded forthwith to adjust around the car the apparatus belonging to the condenser. 126687|0|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1075|This apparatus will require some little explanation, and your Excellencies will please to bear in mind that my object, in the first place, was to surround myself and cat entirely with a barricade against the highly rarefied atmosphere in which I was existing, with the intention of introducing within this barricade, by means of my condenser, a quantity of this same atmosphere sufficiently condensed for the purposes of respiration. 126871|1|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1076|This done, a few more of the loops were unfastened from the rim, a farther portion of the cloth introduced, and the disengaged loops then connected with their proper buttons. 127304|10|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1077|In this way it was possible to insert the whole upper part of the bag between the net-work and the hoop. 127478|11|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1078|It is evident that the hoop would now drop down within the car, while the whole weight of the car itself, with all its contents, would be held up merely by the strength of the buttons. 127582|12|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1079|This, at first sight, would seem an inadequate dependence; but it was by no means so, for the buttons were not only very strong in themselves, but so close together that a very slight portion of the whole weight was supported by any one of them. 127766|13|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1080|Indeed, had the car and contents been three times heavier than they were, I should not have been at all uneasy. 128011|14|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1081|I now raised up the hoop again within the covering of gum-elastic, and propped it at nearly its former height by means of three light poles prepared for the occasion. 128122|15|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1082|This was done, of course, to keep the bag distended at the top, and to preserve the lower part of the net-work in its proper situation. 128288|16|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1083|All that now remained was to fasten up the mouth of the enclosure; and this was readily accomplished by gathering the folds of the material together, and twisting them up very tightly on the inside by means of a kind of stationary tourniquet. 128423|17|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1084|With this object in view I had prepared a very strong perfectly air-tight, but flexible gum-elastic bag. 128665|2|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1085|In this bag, which was of sufficient dimensions, the entire car was in a manner placed. 128769|3|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1086|That is to say, it (the bag) was drawn over the whole bottom of the car, up its sides, and so on, along the outside of the ropes, to the upper rim or hoop where the net-work is attached. 128856|4|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1087|Having pulled the bag up in this way, and formed a complete enclosure on all sides, and at botttom, it was now necessary to fasten up its top or mouth, by passing its material over the hoop of the net-work–in other words, between the net-work and the hoop. 129042|5|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1088|But if the net-work were separated from the hoop to admit this passage, what was to sustain the car in the meantime? 129298|6|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1089|Now the net-work was not permanently fastened to the hoop, but attached by a series of running loops or nooses. 129414|7|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1090|I therefore undid only a few of these loops at one time, leaving the car suspended by the remainder. 129525|8|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1091|Having thus inserted a portion of the cloth forming the upper part of the bag, I refastened the loops–not to the hoop, for that would have been impossible, since the cloth now intervened–but to a series of large buttons, affixed to the cloth itself, about three feet below the mouth of the bag, the intervals between the buttons having been made to correspond to the intervals between the loops. 129625|9|39|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1092|The balloon (for such no doubt it was) had now descended to within a hundred feet of the earth, allowing the crowd below a sufficiently distinct view of the person of its occupant. 130020|0|4|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1093|This was in truth a very droll little somebody. 130200|1|4|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1094|He could not have been more than two feet in height; but this altitude, little as it was, would have been sufficient to destroy his equilibrium, and tilt him over the edge of his tiny car, but for the intervention of a circular rim reaching as high as the breast, and rigged on to the cords of the balloon. 130247|2|4|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1095|The body of the little man was more than proportionately broad, giving to his entire figure a rotundity highly absurd. 130553|3|4|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1096|His feet, of course, could not be seen at all, although a horny substance of suspicious nature was occasionally protruded through a rent in the bottom of the car, or to speak more properly, in the top of the hat. 130671|4|4|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1097|His hands were enormously large. 130883|5|4|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1098|His hair was extremely gray, and collected in a cue behind. 130915|6|4|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1099|His nose was prodigiously long, crooked, and inflammatory; his eyes full, brilliant, and acute; his chin and cheeks, although wrinkled with age, were broad, puffy, and double; but of ears of any kind or character there was not a semblance to be discovered upon any portion of his head. 130974|7|4|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1100|This odd little gentleman was dressed in a loose surtout of sky-blue satin, with tight breeches to match, fastened with silver buckles at the knees. 131259|8|4|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1101|His vest was of some bright yellow material; a white taffety cap was set jauntily on one side of his head; and, to complete his equipment, a blood-red silk handkerchief enveloped his throat, and fell down, in a dainty manner, upon his bosom, in a fantastic bow-knot of super-eminent dimensions. 131407|9|4|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1102|In the sides of the covering thus adjusted round the car, had been inserted three circular panes of thick but clear glass, through which I could see without difficulty around me in every horizontal direction. 131701|0|40|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1103|In that portion of the cloth forming the bottom, was likewise, a fourth window, of the same kind, and corresponding with a small aperture in the floor of the car itself. 131909|1|40|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1104|This enabled me to see perpendicularly down, but having found it impossible to place any similar contrivance overhead, on account of the peculiar manner of closing up the opening there, and the consequent wrinkles in the cloth, I could expect to see no objects situated directly in my zenith. 132078|2|40|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1105|This, of course, was a matter of little consequence; for had I even been able to place a window at top, the balloon itself would have prevented my making any use of it. 132370|3|40|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1106|About a foot below one of the side windows was a circular opening, eight inches in diameter, and fitted with a brass rim adapted in its inner edge to the windings of a screw. 132538|0|41|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1107|In this rim was screwed the large tube of the condenser, the body of the machine being, of course, within the chamber of gum-elastic. 132712|1|41|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1108|Through this tube a quantity of the rare atmosphere circumjacent being drawn by means of a vacuum created in the body of the machine, was thence discharged, in a state of condensation, to mingle with the thin air already in the chamber. 132845|2|41|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1109|This operation being repeated several times, at length filled the chamber with atmosphere proper for all the purposes of respiration. 133081|3|41|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1110|But in so confined a space it would, in a short time, necessarily become foul, and unfit for use from frequent contact with the lungs. 133214|4|41|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1111|It was then ejected by a small valve at the bottom of the car–the dense air readily sinking into the thinner atmosphere below. 133348|5|41|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1112|To avoid the inconvenience of making a total vacuum at any moment within the chamber, this purification was never accomplished all at once, but in a gradual manner–the valve being opened only for a few seconds, then closed again, until one or two strokes from the pump of the condenser had supplied the place of the atmosphere ejected. 133474|6|41|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1113|For the sake of experiment I had put the cat and kittens in a small basket, and suspended it outside the car to a button at the bottom, close by the valve, through which I could feed them at any moment when necessary. 133809|7|41|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1114|I did this at some little risk, and before closing the mouth of the chamber, by reaching under the car with one of the poles before mentioned to which a hook had been attached. 134026|8|41|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1115|By the time I had fully completed these arrangements and filled the chamber as explained, it wanted only ten minutes of nine o'clock. 134202|0|42|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1116|During the whole period of my being thus employed, I endured the most terrible distress from difficulty of respiration, and bitterly did I repent the negligence or rather fool-hardiness, of which I had been guilty, of putting off to the last moment a matter of so much importance. 134335|1|42|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1117|But having at length accomplished it, I soon began to reap the benefit of my invention. 134615|2|42|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1118|Once again I breathed with perfect freedom and ease–and indeed why should I not? 134702|3|42|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1119|I was also agreeably surprised to find myself, in a great measure, relieved from the violent pains which had hitherto tormented me. 134782|4|42|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1120|A slight headache, accompanied with a sensation of fulness or distention about the wrists, the ankles, and the throat, was nearly all of which I had now to complain. 134913|5|42|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1121|Thus it seemed evident that a greater part of the uneasiness attending the removal of atmospheric pressure had actually worn off, as I had expected, and that much of the pain endured for the last two hours should have been attributed altogether to the effects of a deficient respiration. 135078|6|42|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1122|At twenty minutes before nine o'clock–that is to say, a short time prior to my closing up the mouth of the chamber, the mercury attained its limit, or ran down, in the barometer, which, as I mentioned before, was one of an extended construction. 135365|0|43|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1123|It then indicated an altitude on my part of 132,000 feet, or five-and-twenty miles, and I consequently surveyed at that time an extent of the earth's area amounting to no less than the three hundred-and-twentieth part of its entire superficies. 135610|1|43|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1124|At nine o'clock I had again lost sight of land to the eastward, but not before I became aware that the balloon was drifting rapidly to the N. N. W. The convexity of the ocean beneath me was very evident indeed, although my view was often interrupted by the masses of cloud which floated to and fro. 135854|2|43|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1125|I observed now that even the lightest vapors never rose to more than ten miles above the level of the sea. 136152|3|43|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1126|At half past nine I tried the experiment of throwing out a handful of feathers through the valve. 136258|0|44|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1127|They did not float as I had expected; but dropped down perpendicularly, like a bullet, en masse, and with the greatest velocity–being out of sight in a very few seconds. 136355|1|44|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1128|I did not at first know what to make of this extraordinary phenomenon; not being able to believe that my rate of ascent had, of a sudden, met with so prodigious an acceleration. 136524|2|44|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1129|But it soon occurred to me that the atmosphere was now far too rare to sustain even the feathers; that they actually fell, as they appeared to do, with great rapidity; and that I had been surprised by the united velocities of their descent and my own elevation. 136701|3|44|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1130|By ten o'clock I found that I had very little to occupy my immediate attention. 136962|0|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1131|Affairs went swimmingly, and I believed the balloon to be going upward witb a speed increasing momently although I had no longer any means of ascertaining the progression of the increase. 137041|1|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1132|And out of this melancholy water arose a forest of tall eastern trees, like a wilderness of dreams. 137228|10|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1133|And I have in mind that the shadows of the trees which fell upon the lake remained not on the surface where they fell, but sunk slowly and steadily down, and commingled with the waves, while from the trunks of the trees other shadows were continually coming out, and taking the place of their brothers thus entombed. 137327|11|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1134|"""This then,"" I said thoughtfully, ""is the very reason why the waters of this lake grow blacker with age, and more melancholy as the hours run on"". 137643"|12|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1135|But fancies such as these were not the sole possessors of my brain. 137789|13|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1136|Horrors of a nature most stern and most appalling would too frequently obtrude themselves upon my mind, and shake the innermost depths of my soul with the bare supposition of their possibility. 137856|14|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1137|Yet I would not suffer my thoughts for any length of time to dwell upon these latter speculations, rightly judging the real and palpable dangers of the voyage sufficient for my undivided attention. 138049|15|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1138|I suffered no pain or uneasiness of any kind, and enjoyed better spirits than I had at any period since my departure from Rotterdam, busying myself now in examining the state of my various apparatus, and now in regenerating the atmosphere within the chamber. 138246|2|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1139|This latter point I determined to attend to at regular intervals of forty minutes, more on account of the preservation of my health, than from so frequent a renovation being absolutely necessary. 138504|3|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1140|In the meanwhile I could not help making anticipations. 138699|4|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1141|Fancy revelled in the wild and dreamy regions of the moon. 138754|5|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1142|Imagination, feeling herself for once unshackled, roamed at will among the ever-changing wonders of a shadowy and unstable land. 138812|6|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1143|Now there were boary and time-honored forests, and craggy precipices, and waterfalls tumbling with a loud noise into abysses without a bottom. 138940|7|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1144|Then I came suddenly into still noonday solitudes, where no wind of heaven ever intruded, and where vast meadows of poppies, and slender, lily-looking flowers spread themselves out a weary distance, all silent and motionless forever. 139082|8|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1145|Then again I journeyed far down away into another country where it was all one dim and vague lake, with a boundary line of clouds. 139315|9|45|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1146|At five o'clock, p. 139445|0|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1147|m. 139464|1|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1148|Positively, there could not have intervened the tenth part of a second between the disengagement of the basket and its absolute and total disappearance with all that it contained. 139466|10|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1149|My good wishes followed it to the earth, but of course, I had no hope that either cat or kittens would ever live to tell the tale of their misfortune. 139645|11|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1150|, being engaged in regenerating the atmosphere within the chamber, I took that opportunity of observing the cat and kittens through the valve. 139795|2|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1151|The cat herself appeared to suffer again very much, and I had no hesitation in attributing her uneasiness chiefly to a difficulty in breathing; but my experiment with the kittens had resulted very strangely. 139937|3|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1152|I had expected, of course, to see them betray a sense of pain, although in a less degree than their mother, and this would have been sufficient to confirm my opinion concerning the habitual endurance of atmospheric pressure. 140144|4|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1153|But I was not prepared to find them, upon close examination, evidently enjoying a high degree of health, breathing with the greatest ease and perfect regularity, and evincing not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever. 140368|5|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1154|I could only account for all this by extending my theory, and supposing that the highly rarefied atmosphere around might perhaps not be, as I had taken for granted, chemically insufficient for the purposes of life, and that a person born in such a medium might, possibly, be unaware of any inconvenience attending its inhalation, while, upon removal to the denser strata near the earth, he might endure tortures of a similar nature to those I had so lately experienced. 140593|6|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1155|It has since been to me a matter of deep regret that an awkward accident, at this time, occasioned me the loss of my little family of cats, and deprived me of the insight into this matter which a continued experiment might have afforded. 141062|7|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1156|In passing my hand through the valve, with a cup of water for the old puss, the sleeves of my shirt became entangled in the loop which sustained the basket, and thus, in a moment, loosened it from the bottom. 141299|8|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1157|Had the whole actually vanished into air, it could not have shot from my sight in a more abrupt and instantaneous manner. 141507|9|46|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1158|At six o'clock, I perceived a great portion of the earth's visible area to the eastward involved in thick shadow, which continued to advance with great rapidity, until, at five minutes before seven, the whole surface in view was enveloped in the darkness of night. 141628|0|47|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1159|It was not, however, until long after this time that the rays of the setting sun ceased to illumine the balloon; and this circumstance, although of course fully anticipated, did not fail to give me an infinite deal of pleasure. 141892|1|47|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1160|It was evident that, in the morning, I should behold the rising luminary many hours at least before the citizens of Rotterdam, in spite of their situation so much farther to the eastward, and thus, day after day, in proportion to the height ascended, would I enjoy the light of the sun for a longer and a longer period. 142119|2|47|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1161|I now determined to keep a journal of my passage, reckoning the days from one to twenty-four hours continuously, without taking into consideration the intervals of darkness. 142438|3|47|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1162|At ten o'clock, feeling sleepy, I determined to lie down for the rest of the night; but here a difficulty presented itself, which, obvious as it may appear, had escaped my attention up to the very moment of which I am now speaking. 142611|0|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1163|If I went to sleep as I proposed, how could the atmosphere in the chamber be regenerated in the interim? 142842|1|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1164|My own case, however, was very different indeed, and left me no room for any similar idea; for I did not wish to keep awake, but to be aroused from slumber at regular intervals of time. 142946|10|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1165|I at length hit upon the following expedient, which, simple as it may seem, was hailed by me, at the moment of discovery, as an invention fully equal to that of the telescope, the steam-engine, or the art of printing itself. 143131|11|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1166|To breathe it for more than an hour, at the farthest, would be a matter of impossibility, or, if even this term could be extended to an hour and a quarter, the most ruinous consequences might ensue. 143355|2|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1167|The consideration of this dilemma gave me no little disquietude; and it will hardly be believed, that, after the dangers I had undergone, I should look upon this business in so serious a light, as to give up all hope of accomplishing my ultimate design, and finally make up my mind to the necessity of a descent. 143553|3|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1168|But this hesitation was only momentary. 143865|4|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1169|I reflected that man is the veriest slave of custom, and that many points in the routine of his existence are deemed essentially important, which are only so at all by his having rendered them habitual. 143904|5|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1170|It was very certain that I could not do without sleep; but I might easily bring myself to feel no inconvenience from being awakened at intervals of an hour during the whole period of my repose. 144106|6|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1171|It would require but five minutes at most to regenerate the atmosphere in the fullest manner, and the only real difficulty was to contrive a method of arousing myself at the proper moment for so doing. 144299|7|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1172|But this was a question which, I am willing to confess, occasioned me no little trouble in its solution. 144500|8|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1173|To be sure, I had heard of the student who, to prevent his falling asleep over his books, held in one hand a ball of copper, the din of whose descent into a basin of the same metal on the floor beside his chair, served effectually to startle him up, if, at any moment, he should be overcome with drowsiness. 144604|9|48|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1174|It is necessary to premise, that the balloon, at the elevation now attained, continued its course upward with an even and undeviating ascent, and the car consequently followed with a steadiness so perfect that it would have been impossible to detect in it the slightest vacillation whatever. 144911|0|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1175|This circumstance favored me greatly in the project I now determined to adopt. 145202|1|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1176|My bed was so contrived upon the floor of the car, as to bring my head, in lying down, immediately below the mouth of the pitcher. 145280|10|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1177|It was evident, that, at the expiration of an hour, the pitcher, getting full, would be forced to run over, and to run over at the mouth, which was somewhat lower than the rim. 145410|11|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1178|It was also evident, that the water thus falling from a height of more than four feet, could not do otherwise than fall upon my face, and that the sure consequences would be, to waken me up instantaneously, even from the soundest slumber in the world. 145586|12|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1179|My supply of water had been put on board in kegs containing five gallons each, and ranged very securely around the interior of the car. 145837|2|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1180|I unfastened one of these, and taking two ropes tied them tightly across the rim of the wicker-work from one side to the other; placing them about a foot apart and parallel so as to form a kind of shelf, upon which I placed the keg, and steadied it in a horizontal position. 145972|3|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1181|About eight inches immediately below these ropes, and four feet from the bottom of the car I fastened another shelf–but made of thin plank, being the only similar piece of wood I had. 146246|4|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1182|Upon this latter shelf, and exactly beneath one of the rims of the keg, a small earthern pitcher was deposited. 146429|5|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1183|I now bored a hole in the end of the keg over the pitcher, and fitted in a plug of soft wood, cut in a tapering or conical shape. 146540|6|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1184|This plug I pushed in or pulled out, as might happen, until, after a few experiments, it arrived at that exact degree of tightness, at which the water, oozing from the hole, and falling into the pitcher below, would fill the latter to the brim in the period of sixty minutes. 146669|7|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1185|This, of course, was a matter briefly and easily ascertained, by noticing the proportion of the pitcher filled in any given time. 146944|8|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1186|Having arranged all this, the rest of the plan is obvious. 147073|9|49|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1187|Having descended, as I said before, to about one hundred feet from the surface of the earth, the little old gentleman was suddenly seized with a fit of trepidation, and appeared disinclined to make any nearer approach to terra firma. 147131|0|5|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1188|Throwing out, therefore, a quantity of sand from a canvas bag, which, he lifted with great difficulty, he became stationary in an instant. 147364|1|5|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1189|He then proceeded, in a hurried and agitated manner, to extract from a side-pocket in his surtout a large morocco pocket-book. 147502|2|5|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1190|This he poised suspiciously in his hand, then eyed it with an air of extreme surprise, and was evidently astonished at its weight. 147628|3|5|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1191|He at length opened it, and drawing there from a huge letter sealed with red sealing-wax and tied carefully with red tape, let it fall precisely at the feet of the burgomaster, Superbus Von Underduk. 147758|4|5|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1192|His Excellency stooped to take it up. 147957|5|5|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1193|But the aeronaut, still greatly discomposed, and having apparently no farther business to detain him in Rotterdam, began at this moment to make busy preparations for departure; and it being necessary to discharge a portion of ballast to enable him to reascend, the half dozen bags which he threw out, one after another, without taking the trouble to empty their contents, tumbled, every one of them, most unfortunately upon the back of the burgomaster, and rolled him over and over no less than one-and-twenty times, in the face of every man in Rotterdam. 147994|6|5|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1194|It is not to be supposed, however, that the great Underduk suffered this impertinence on the part of the little old man to pass off with impunity. 148549|7|5|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1195|It is said, on the contrary, that during each and every one of his one-and twenty circumvolutions he emitted no less than one-and-twenty distinct and furious whiffs from his pipe, to which he held fast the whole time with all his might, and to which he intends holding fast until the day of his death. 148695|8|5|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1196|It was fully eleven by the time I had completed these arrangements, and I immediately betook myself to bed, with full confidence in the efficiency of my invention. 148996|0|50|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1197|Nor in this matter was I disappointed. 149159|1|50|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1198|Punctually every sixty minutes was I aroused by my trusty chronometer, when, having emptied the pitcher into the bung-hole of the keg, and performed the duties of the condenser, I retired again to bed. 149197|2|50|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1199|These regular interruptions to my slumber caused me even less discomfort than I had anticipated; and when I finally arose for the day, it was seven o'clock, and the sun had attained many degrees above the line of my horizon. 149398|3|50|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1200|April 3d. 149622|0|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1201|I found the balloon at an immense height indeed, and the earth's apparent convexity increased in a material degree. 149631|1|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1202|When darkness came over the earth, I betook myself to bed, although it was for many hours afterward broad daylight all around my immediate situation. 149746|10|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1203|The water-clock was punctual in its duty, and I slept until next morning soundly, with the exception of the periodical interruption. 149895|11|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1204|Below me in the ocean lay a cluster of black specks, which undoubtedly were islands. 150027|2|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1205|Far away to the northward I perceived a thin, white, and exceedingly brilliant line, or streak, on the edge of the horizon, and I had no hesitation in supposing it to be the southern disk of the ices of the Polar Sea. 150111|3|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1206|My curiosity was greatly excited, for I had hopes of passing on much farther to the north, and might possibly, at some period, find myself placed directly above the Pole itself. 150328|4|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1207|I now lamented that my great elevation would, in this case, prevent my taking as accurate a survey as I could wish. 150505|5|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1208|Much, however, might be ascertained. 150620|6|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1209|Nothing else of an extraordinary nature occurred during the day. 150656|7|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1210|My apparatus all continued in good order, and the balloon still ascended without any perceptible vacillation. 150720|8|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1211|The cold was intense, and obliged me to wrap up closely in an overcoat. 150829|9|51|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1212|April 4th. 150900|0|52|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1213|Arose in good health and spirits, and was astonished at the singular change which had taken place in the appearance of the sea. 150910|1|52|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1214|It had lost, in a great measure, the deep tint of blue it had hitherto worn, being now of a grayish-white, and of a lustre dazzling to the eye. 151037|2|52|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1215|The islands were no longer visible; whether they had passed down the horizon to the southeast, or whether my increasing elevation had left them out of sight, it is impossible to say. 151180|3|52|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1216|I was inclined, however, to the latter opinion. 151362|4|52|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1217|The rim of ice to the northward was growing more and more apparent. 151409|5|52|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1218|Cold by no means so intense. 151476|6|52|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1219|Nothing of importance occurred, and I passed the day in reading, having taken care to supply myself with books. 151504|7|52|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1220|April 5th. 151615|0|53|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1221|Beheld the singular phenomenon of the sun rising while nearly the whole visible surface of the earth continued to be involved in darkness. 151625|1|53|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1222|In time, however, the light spread itself over all, and I again saw the line of ice to the northward. 151763|2|53|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1223|It was now very distinct, and appeared of a much darker hue than the waters of the ocean. 151864|3|53|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1224|I was evidently approaching it, and with great rapidity. 151953|4|53|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1225|Fancied I could again distinguish a strip of land to the eastward, and one also to the westward, but could not be certain. 152009|5|53|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1226|Weather moderate. 152131|6|53|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1227|Nothing of any consequence happened during the day. 152148|7|53|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1228|Went early to bed. 152199|8|53|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1229|April 6th. 152217|0|54|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1230|Was surprised at finding the rim of ice at a very moderate distance, and an immense field of the same material stretching away off to the horizon in the north. 152227|1|54|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1231|It was evident that if the balloon held its present course, it would soon arrive above the Frozen Ocean, and I had now little doubt of ultimately seeing the Pole. 152386|2|54|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1232|During the whole of the day I continued to near the ice. 152548|3|54|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1233|Toward night the limits of my horizon very suddenly and materially increased, owing undoubtedly to the earth's form being that of an oblate spheroid, and my arriving above the flattened regions in the vicinity of the Arctic circle. 152604|4|54|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1234|When darkness at length overtook me, I went to bed in great anxiety, fearing to pass over the object of so much curiosity when I should have no opportunity of observing it. 152835|5|54|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1235|April 7th. 153007|0|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1236|Arose early, and, to my great joy, at length beheld what there could be no hesitation in supposing the northern Pole itself. 153017|1|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1237|In the first few degrees of this its progress, its surface is very sensibly flattened, farther on depressed into a plane, and finally, becoming not a little concave, it terminates, at the Pole itself, in a circular centre, sharply defined, wbose apparent diameter subtended at the balloon an angle of about sixty-five seconds, and whose dusky hue, varying in intensity, was, at all times, darker than any other spot upon the visible hemisphere, and occasionally deepened into the most absolute and impenetrable blackness. 153141|10|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1238|Farther than this, little could be ascertained. 153662|11|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1239|By twelve o'clock the circular centre had materially decreased in circumference, and by seven P.M. I lost sight of it entirely; the balloon passing over the western limb of the ice, and floating away rapidly in the direction of the equator. 153709|12|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1240|It was there, beyond a doubt, and immediately beneath my feet; but, alas! 153949|2|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1241|I had now ascended to so vast a distance, that nothing could with accuracy be discerned. 154022|3|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1242|Indeed, to judge from the progression of the numbers indicating my various altitudes, respectively, at different periods, between six A.M. on the second of April, and twenty minutes before nine A.M. of the same day (at which time the barometer ran down), it might be fairly inferred that the balloon had now, at four o'clock in the morning of April the seventh, reached a height of not less, certainly, than 7,254 miles above the surface of the sea. 154110|4|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1243|This elevation may appear immense, but the estimate upon which it is calculated gave a result in all probability far inferior to the truth. 154559|5|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1244|At all events I undoubtedly beheld the whole of the earth's major diameter; the entire northern hemisphere lay beneath me like a chart orthographically projected: and the great circle of the equator itself formed the boundary line of my horizon. 154698|6|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1245|Your Excellencies may, however, readily imagine that the confined regions hitherto unexplored within the limits of the Arctic circle, although situated directly beneath me, and therefore seen without any appearance of being foreshortened, were still, in themselves, comparatively too diminutive, and at too great a distance from the point of sight, to admit of any very accurate examination. 154943|7|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1246|Nevertheless, what could be seen was of a nature singular and exciting. 155334|8|55|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

1250|The whole visible area partook in different degrees of a tint of pale yellow, and in some portions had acquired a brilliancy even painful to the eye. 155758|2|56|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1251|My view downward was also considerably impeded by the dense atmosphere in the vicinity of the surface being loaded with clouds, between whose masses I could only now and then obtain a glimpse of the earth itself. 155907|3|56|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1252|This difficulty of direct vision had troubled me more or less for the last forty-eight hours; but my present enormous elevation brought closer together, as it were, the floating bodies of vapor, and the inconvenience became, of course, more and more palpable in proportion to my ascent. 156119|4|56|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1253|Nevertheless, I could easily perceive that the balloon now hovered above the range of great lakes in the continent of North America, and was holding a course, due south, which would bring me to the tropics. 156405|5|56|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

1260|I was suddenly aroused from slumber, about five o'clock this morning, by a loud, crackling, and terrific sound, for which I could in no manner account. 157294|1|58|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1261|It was of very brief duration, but, while it lasted resembled nothing in the world of which I had any previous experience. 157445|2|58|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1262|It is needless to say that I became excessively alarmed, having, in the first instance, attributed the noise to the bursting of the balloon. 157567|3|58|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1263|I examined all my apparatus, however, with great attention, and could discover nothing out of order. 157707|4|58|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1264|Spent a great part of the day in meditating upon an occurrence so extraordinary, but could find no means whatever of accounting for it. 157807|5|58|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

1269|In the meantime the balloon arose like a lark, and, soaring far away above the city, at length drifted quietly behind a cloud similar to that from which it had so oddly emerged, and was thus lost forever to the wondering eyes of the good citiezns of Rotterdam. 158354|0|6|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1270|All attention was now directed to the letter, the descent of which, and the consequences attending thereupon, had proved so fatally subversive of both person and personal dignity to his Excellency, the illustrious Burgomaster Mynheer Superbus Von Underduk. 158614|1|6|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1271|That functionary, however, had not failed, during his circumgyratory movements, to bestow a thought upon the important subject of securing the packet in question, which was seen, upon inspection, to have fAllan into the most proper hands, being actually addressed to himself and Professor Rub-a-dub, in their official capacities of President and Vice-President of the Rotterdam College of Astronomy. 158870|2|6|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

1275|Having reached, in its former course, about the twentieth parallel of southern latitude, it turned off suddenly, at an acute angle, to the eastward, and thus proceeded throughout the day, keeping nearly, if not altogether, in the exact plane of the lunar elipse. 159581|2|60|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1276|What was worthy of remark, a very perceptible vacillation in the car was a consequence of this change of route–a vacillation which prevailed, in a more or less degree, for a period of many hours. 159843|3|60|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

1282|Your Excellencies may perhaps be able to remember an humble artizan, by name Hans Phaall, and by occupation a mender of bellows, who, with three others, disappeared from Rotterdam, about five years ago, in a manner which must have been considered by all parties at once sudden, and extremely unaccountable. 160519|0|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1283|If, however, it so please your Excellencies, I, the writer of this communication, am the identical Hans Phaall himself. 160825|1|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1284|This was a state of things not to be endured. 160944|10|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1285|I soon grew as poor as a rat, and, having a wife and children to provide for, my burdens at length became intolerable, and I spent hour after hour in reflecting upon the most convenient method of putting an end to my life. 160989|11|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1286|Duns, in the meantime, left me little leisure for contemplation. 161211|12|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1287|My house was literally besieged from morning till night, so that I began to rave, and foam, and fret like a caged tiger against the bars of his enclosure. 161275|13|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1288|There were three fellows in particular who worried me beyond endurance, keeping watch continually about my door, and threatening me with the law. 161429|14|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1289|Upon these three I internally vowed the bitterest revenge, if ever I should be so happy as to get them within my clutches; and I believe nothing in the world but the pleasure of this anticipation prevented me from putting my plan of suicide into immediate execution, by blowing my brains out with a blunderbuss. 161574|15|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1290|I thought it best, however, to dissemble my wrath, and to treat them with promises and fair words, until, by some good turn of fate, an opportunity of vengeance should be afforded me. 161885|16|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1291|It is well known to most of my fellow citizens, that for the period of forty years I continued to occupy the little square brick building, at the head of the alley called Sauerkraut, in which I resided at the time of my disappearance. 162068|2|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1292|My ancestors have also resided therein time out of mind–they, as well as myself, steadily following the respectable and indeed lucrative profession of mending of bellows. 162302|3|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1293|For, to speak the truth, until of late years, that the heads of all the people have been set agog with politics, no better business than my own could an honest citizen of Rotterdam either desire or deserve. 162472|4|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1294|Credit was good, employment was never wanting, and on all hands there was no lack of either money or good-will. 162678|5|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1295|But, as I was saying, we soon began to feel the effects of liberty and long speeches, and radicalism, and all that sort of thing. 162789|6|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1296|People who were formerly, the very best customers in the world, had now not a moment of time to think of us at all. 162918|7|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1297|They had, so they said, as much as they could do to read about the revolutions, and keep up with the march of intellect and the spirit of the age. 163033|8|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1298|If a fire wanted fanning, it could readily be fanned with a newspaper, and as the government grew weaker, I have no doubt that leather and iron acquired durability in proportion, for, in a very short time, there was not a pair of bellows in all Rotterdam that ever stood in need of a stitch or required the assistance of a hammer. 163179|9|8|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1299|One day, having given my creditors the slip, and feeling more than usually dejected, I continued for a long time to wander about the most obscure streets without object whatever, until at length I chanced to stumble against the corner of a bookseller's stall. 163509|0|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1300|Seeing a chair close at hand, for the use of customers, I threw myself doggedly into it, and, hardly knowing why, opened the pages of the first volume which came within my reach. 163768|1|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1301|Nature herself seemed to afford me corroboration of these ideas. 163946|10|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1302|In the contemplation of the heavenly bodies it struck me forcibly that I could not distinguish a star with nearly as much precision, when I gazed on it with earnest, direct and undeviating attention, as when I suffered my eye only to glance in its vicinity alone. 164010|11|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1303|I was not, of course, at that time aware that this apparent paradox was occasioned by the center of the visual area being less susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the exterior portions of the retina. 164273|12|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1304|This knowledge, and some of another kind, came afterwards in the course of an eventful five years, during which I have dropped the prejudices of my former humble situation in life, and forgotten the bellows-mender in far different occupations. 164484|13|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1305|But at the epoch of which I speak, the analogy which a casual observation of a star offered to the conclusions I had already drawn, struck me with the force of positive conformation, and I then finally made up my mind to the course which I afterwards pursued. 164727|14|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1306|It proved to be a small pamphlet treatise on Speculative Astronomy, written either by Professor Encke of Berlin or by a Frenchman of somewhat similar name. 164986|2|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1307|I had some little tincture of information on matters of this nature, and soon became more and more absorbed in the contents of the book, reading it actually through twice before I awoke to a recollection of what was passing around me. 165141|3|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1308|By this time it began to grow dark, and I directed my steps toward home. 165375|4|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1309|But the treatise had made an indelible impression on my mind, and, as I sauntered along the dusky streets, I revolved carefully over in my memory the wild and sometimes unintelligible reasonings of the writer. 165447|5|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1310|There are some particular passages which affected my imagination in a powerful and extraordinary manner. 165656|6|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1311|The longer I meditated upon these the more intense grew the interest which had been excited within me. 165760|7|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1312|The limited nature of my education in general, and more especially my ignorance on subjects connected with natural philosophy, so far from rendering me diffident of my own ability to comprehend what I had read, or inducing me to mistrust the many vague notions which had arisen in consequence, merely served as a farther stimulus to imagination; and I was vain enough, or perhaps reasonable enough, to doubt whether those crude ideas which, arising in ill-regulated minds, have all the appearance, may not often in effect possess all the force, the reality, and other inherent properties, of instinct or intuition; whether, to proceed a step farther, profundity itself might not, in matters of a purely speculative nature, be detected as a legitimate source of falsity and error. 165862|8|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
1313|In other words, I believed, and still do believe, that truth, is frequently of its own essence, superficial, and that, in many cases, the depth lies more in the abysses where we seek her, than in the actual situations wherein she may be found. 166641|9|9|The Unparalleled Adventure Of One Hans Pfaall|1835-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

1322|Yet neither the mandate of the monarch, nor the huge barriers erected at the entrances of the streets, nor the prospect of that loathsome death which, with almost absolute certainty, overwhelmed the wretch whom no peril could deter from the adventure, prevented the unfurnished and untenanted dwellings from being stripped, by the hand of nightly rapine, of every article, such as iron, brass, or lead-work, which could in any manner be turned to a profitable account. 168091|1|10|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1323|Above all, it was usually found, upon the annual winter opening of the barriers, that locks, bolts, and secret cellars, had proved but slender protection to those rich stores of wines and liquors which, in consideration of the risk and trouble of removal, many of the numerous dealers having shops in the neighbourhood had consented to trust, during the period of exile, to so insufficient a security. 168559|0|11|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']

1336|Onward --still onward stalked the grim Legs, making the desolate solemnity echo and re-echo with yells like the terrific war-whoop of the Indian: and onward, still onward rolled the dumpy Tarpaulin, hanging on to the doublet of his more active companion, and far surpassing the latter's most strenuous exertions in the way of vocal music, by bull-roarings in basso, from the profundity of his stentorian lungs. 171215|2|15|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1337|They had now evidently reached the strong hold of the pestilence. 171625|0|16|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1338|Their way at every step or plunge grew more noisome and more horrible --the paths more narrow and more intricate. 171690|1|16|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1339|Huge stones and beams falling momently from the decaying roofs above them, gave evidence, by their sullen and heavy descent, of the vast height of the surrounding houses; and while actual exertion became necessary to force a passage through frequent heaps of rubbish, it was by no means seldom that the hand fell upon a skeleton or rested upon a more fleshly corpse. 171803|2|16|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1340|Suddenly, as the seamen stumbled against the entrance of a tall and ghastly-looking building, a yell more than usually shrill from the throat of the excited Legs, was replied to from within, in a rapid succession of wild, laughter-like, and fiendish shrieks. 172169|0|17|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1341|Nothing daunted at sounds which, of such a nature, at such a time, and in such a place, might have curdled the very blood in hearts less irrevocably on fire, the drunken couple rushed headlong against the door, burst it open, and staggered into the midst of things with a volley of curses. 172427|1|17|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1342|The room within which they found themselves proved to be the shop of an undertaker; but an open trap-door, in a corner of the floor near the entrance, looked down upon a long range of wine-cellars, whose depths the occasional sound of bursting bottles proclaimed to be well stored with their appropriate contents. 172716|0|18|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1343|In the middle of the room stood a table --in the centre of which again arose a huge tub of what appeared to be punch. 173029|1|18|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1344|Bottles of various wines and cordials, together with jugs, pitchers, and flagons of every shape and quality, were scattered profusely upon the board. 173146|2|18|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1345|Around it, upon coffin-tressels, was seated a company of six. 173295|3|18|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1346|This company I will endeavor to delineate one by one. 173356|4|18|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1347|Fronting the entrance, and elevated a little above his companions, sat a personage who appeared to be the president of the table. 173409|0|19|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1348|His stature was gaunt and tall, and Legs was confounded to behold in him a figure more emaciated than himself. 173538|1|19|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1349|His face was as yellow as saffron --but no feature excepting one alone, was sufficiently marked to merit a particular description. 173648|2|19|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1350|This one consisted in a forehead so unusually and hideously lofty, as to have the appearance of a bonnet or crown of flesh superadded upon the natural head. 173778|3|19|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1351|His mouth was puckered and dimpled into an expression of ghastly affability, and his eyes, as indeed the eyes of all at table, were glazed over with the fumes of intoxication. 173934|4|19|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1352|This gentleman was clothed from head to foot in a richly-embroidered black silk-velvet pall, wrapped negligently around his form after the fashion of a Spanish cloak. 174109|5|19|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1353|--His head was stuck full of sable hearse-plumes, which he nodded to and fro with a jaunty and knowing air; and, in his right hand, he held a huge human thigh-bone, with which he appeared to have been just knocking down some member of the company for a song. 174275|6|19|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1354|The room, although ill-contrived, smoke-blackened, low-pitched, and in every other respect agreeing with the general character of such places at the period --was, nevertheless, in the opinion of the grotesque groups scattered here and there within it, sufficiently well adapted to its purpose. 174533|0|2|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1355|The year had been a year of terror, and of feelings more intense than terror for which there is no name upon the earth. 174826|0|2|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1356|For many prodigies and signs had taken place, and far and wide, over sea and land, the black wings of the Pestilence were spread abroad. 174945|1|2|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1357|To those, nevertheless, cunning in the stars, it was not unknown that the heavens wore an aspect of ill; and to me, the Greek Oinos, among others, it was evident that now had arrived the alternation of that seven hundred and ninety-fourth year when, at the entrance of Aries, the planet Jupiter is conjoined with the red ring of the terrible Saturnus. 175081|2|2|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1358|The peculiar spirit of the skies, if I mistake not greatly, made itself manifest, not only in the physical orb of the earth, but in the souls, imaginations, and meditations of mankind. 175432|3|2|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1359|Opposite him, and with her back to the door, was a lady of no whit the less extraordinary character. 175616|0|20|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1360|Although quite as tall as the person just described, she had no right to complain of his unnatural emaciation. 175716|1|20|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1361|She was evidently in the last stage of a dropsy; and her figure resembled nearly that of the huge puncheon of October beer which stood, with the head driven in, close by her side, in a corner of the chamber. 175826|2|20|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1362|Her face was exceedingly round, red, and full; and the same peculiarity, or rather want of peculiarity, attached itself to her countenance, which I before mentioned in the case of the president --that is to say, only one feature of her face was sufficiently distinguished to need a separate characterization: indeed the acute Tarpaulin immediately observed that the same remark might have applied to each individual person of the party; every one of whom seemed to possess a monopoly of some particular portion of physiognomy. 176033|3|20|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1363|With the lady in question this portion proved to be the mouth. 176559|4|20|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1364|Commencing at the right ear, it swept with a terrific chasm to the left --the short pendants which she wore in either auricle continually bobbing into the aperture. 176621|5|20|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1365|She made, however, every exertion to keep her mouth closed and look dignified, in a dress consisting of a newly starched and ironed shroud coming up close under her chin, with a crimpled ruffle of cambric muslin. 176785|6|20|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1366|At her right hand sat a diminutive young lady whom she appeared to patronise. 176997|0|21|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1367|This delicate little creature, in the trembling of her wasted fingers, in the livid hue of her lips, and in the slight hectic spot which tinged her otherwise leaden complexion, gave evident indications of a galloping consumption. 177074|1|21|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1368|An air of gave extreme haut ton, however, pervaded her whole appearance; she wore in a graceful and degage manner, a large and beautiful winding-sheet of the finest India lawn; her hair hung in ringlets over her neck; a soft smile played about her mouth; but her nose, extremely long, thin, sinuous, flexible and pimpled, hung down far below her under lip, and in spite of the delicate manner in which she now and then moved it to one side or the other with her tongue, gave to her countenance a somewhat equivocal expression. 177303|2|21|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1369|Over against her, and upon the left of the dropsical lady, was seated a little puffy, wheezing, and gouty old man, whose cheeks reposed upon the shoulders of their owner, like two huge bladders of Oporto wine. 177829|0|22|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1370|With his arms folded, and with one bandaged leg deposited upon the table, he seemed to think himself entitled to some consideration. 178038|1|22|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1371|He evidently prided himself much upon every inch of his personal appearance, but took more especial delight in calling attention to his gaudy-colored surtout. 178170|2|22|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1372|This, to say the truth, must have cost him no little money, and was made to fit him exceedingly well --being fashioned from one of the curiously embroidered silken covers appertaining to those glorious escutcheons which, in England and elsewhere, are customarily hung up, in some conspicuous place, upon the dwellings of departed aristocracy. 178328|3|22|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1373|Next to him, and at the right hand of the president, was a gentleman in long white hose and cotton drawers. 178670|0|23|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1374|"His frame shook, in a ridiculous manner, with a fit of what Tarpaulin called ""the horrors"". 178777"|1|23|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1375|His jaws, which had been newly shaved, were tightly tied up by a bandage of muslin; and his arms being fastened in a similar way at the wrists, I I prevented him from helping himself too freely to the liquors upon the table; a precaution rendered necessary, in the opinion of Legs, by the peculiarly sottish and wine-bibbing cast of his visage. 178868|2|23|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1376|A pair of prodigious ears, nevertheless, which it was no doubt found impossible to confine, towered away into the atmosphere of the apartment, and were occasionally pricked up in a spasm, at the sound of the drawing of a cork. 179212|3|23|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1377|Fronting him, sixthly and lastly, was situated a singularly stiff-looking personage, who, being afflicted with paralysis, must, to speak seriously, have felt very ill at ease in his unaccommodating habiliments. 179438|0|24|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1378|He was habited, somewhat uniquely, in a new and handsome mahogany coffin. 179648|1|24|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1379|Its top or head-piece pressed upon the skull of the wearer, and extended over it in the fashion of a hood, giving to the entire face an air of indescribable interest. 179721|2|24|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1380|Arm-holes had been cut in the sides, for the sake not more of elegance than of convenience; but the dress, nevertheless, prevented its proprietor from sitting as erect as his associates; and as he lay reclining against his tressel, at an angle of forty-five degrees, a pair of huge goggle eyes rolled up their awful whites towards the celling in absolute amazement at their own enormity. 179887|3|24|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1381|Before each of the party lay a portion of a skull, which was used as a drinking cup. 180274|0|25|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1382|Overhead was suspended a human skeleton, by means of a rope tied round one of the legs and fastened to a ring in the ceiling. 180358|1|25|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1383|The other limb, confined by no such fetter, stuck off from the body at right angles, causing the whole loose and rattling frame to dangle and twirl about at the caprice of every occasional puff of wind which found its way into the apartment. 180483|2|25|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1384|In the cranium of this hideous thing lay quantity of ignited charcoal, which threw a fitful but vivid light over the entire scene; while coffins, and other wares appertaining to the shop of an undertaker, were piled high up around the room, and against the windows, preventing any ray from escaping into the street. 180724|3|25|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1385|At sight of this extraordinary assembly, and of their still more extraordinary paraphernalia, our two seamen did not conduct themselves with that degree of decorum which might have been expected. 181039|0|26|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1386|Legs, leaning against the wall near which he happened to be standing, dropped his lower jaw still lower than usual, and spread open his eyes to their fullest extent: while Hugh Tarpaulin, stooping down so as to bring his nose upon a level with the table, and spreading out a palm upon either knee, burst into a long, loud, and obstreperous roar of very ill-timed and immoderate laughter. 181234|1|26|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1387|Without, however, taking offence at behaviour so excessively rude, the tall president smiled very graciously upon the intruders --nodded to them in a dignified manner with his head of sable plumes --and, arising, took each by an arm, and led him to a seat which some others of the company had placed in the meantime for his accommodation. 181621|0|27|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1388|Legs to all this offered not the slightest resistance, but sat down as he was directed; while tile gallant Hugh, removing his coffin tressel from its station near the head of the table, to the vicinity of the little consumptive lady in the winding sheet, plumped down by her side in high glee, and pouring out a skull of red wine, quaffed it to their better acquaintance. 181959|1|27|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']

1391|Of these groups our two seamen formed, I think, the most interesting, if not the most conspicuous. 182624|0|3|King Pest|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Humor']
1392|Over some flasks of the red Chian wine, within the walls of a noble hall, in a dim city called Ptolemais, we sat, at night, a company of seven. 182722|0|3|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1393|And to our chamber there was no entrance save by a lofty door of brass: and the door was fashioned by the artisan Corinnos, and, being of rare workmanship, was fastened from within. 182865|1|3|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1394|Alas! 183046|10|3|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1395|he bore no portion in our mirth, save that his countenance, distorted with the plague, and his eyes, in which Death had but half extinguished the fire of the pestilence, seemed to take such interest in our merriment as the dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to die. 183051|11|3|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1396|But although I, Oinos, felt that the eyes of the departed were upon me, still I forced myself not to perceive the bitterness of their expression, and gazing down steadily into the depths of the ebony mirror, sang with a loud and sonorous voice the songs of the son of Teios. 183335|12|3|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1397|But gradually my songs they ceased, and their echoes, rolling afar off among the sable draperies of the chamber, became weak, and undistinguishable, and so faded away. 183609|13|3|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1398|And lo! 183776|14|3|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1399|from among those sable draperies where the sounds of the song departed, there came forth a dark and undefined shadow–a shadow such as the moon, when low in heaven, might fashion from the figure of a man: but it was the shadow neither of man nor of God, nor of any familiar thing. 183783|15|3|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1400|And quivering awhile among the draperies of the room, it at length rested in full view upon the surface of the door of brass. 184062|16|3|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1401|But the shadow was vague, and formless, and indefinite, and was the shadow neither of man nor of God–neither God of Greece, nor God of Chaldaea, nor any Egyptian God. 184187|17|3|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1402|And the shadow rested upon the brazen doorway, and under the arch of the entablature of the door, and moved not, nor spoke any word, but there became stationary and remained. 184353|18|3|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1403|And the door whereupon the shadow rested was, if I remember aright, over against the feet of the young Zoilus enshrouded. 184527|19|3|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1404|Black draperies, likewise, in the gloomy room, shut out from our view the moon, the lurid stars, and the peopleless streets–but the boding and the memory of Evil they would not be so excluded. 184648|2|3|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1405|But we, the seven there assembled, having seen the shadow as it came out from among the draperies, dared not steadily behold it, but cast down our eyes, and gazed continually into the depths of the mirror of ebony. 184840|20|3|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1406|And at length I, Oinos, speaking some low words, demanded of the shadow its dwelling and its appellation. 185054|21|3|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1407|"And the shadow answered, ""I am SHADOW, and my dwelling is near to the Catacombs of Ptolemais, and hard by those dim plains of Helusion which border upon the foul Charonian canal"". 185159"|22|3|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1408|And then did we, the seven, start from our seats in horror, and stand trembling, and shuddering, and aghast, for the tones in the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one being, but of a multitude of beings, and, varying in their cadences from syllable to syllable fell duskly upon our ears in the well-remembered and familiar accents of many thousand departed friends. 185338|23|3|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1409|There were things around us and about of which I can render no distinct account–things material and spiritual–heaviness in the atmosphere–a sense of suffocation–anxiety–and, above all, that terrible state of existence which the nervous experience when the senses are keenly living and awake, and meanwhile the powers of thought lie dormant. 185716|3|3|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1410|A dead weight hung upon us. 186056|4|3|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1411|It hung upon our limbs–upon the household furniture–upon the goblets from which we drank; and all things were depressed, and borne down thereby–all things save only the flames of the seven lamps which illumined our revel. 186083|5|3|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1412|Uprearing themselves in tall slender lines of light, they thus remained burning all pallid and motionless; and in the mirror which their lustre formed upon the round table of ebony at which we sat, each of us there assembled beheld the pallor of his own countenance, and the unquiet glare in the downcast eyes of his companions. 186304|6|3|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1413|Yet we laughed and were merry in our proper way–which was hysterical; and sang the songs of Anacreon–which are madness; and drank deeply–although the purple wine reminded us of blood. 186632|7|3|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
1414|For there was yet another tenant of our chamber in the person of young Zoilus. 186815|8|3|Shadow—A Parable|1835-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

1720|One consideration which deterred me was, that, having kept no journal during a greater portion of the time in which I was absent, I feared I should not be able to write, from mere memory, a statement so minute and connected as to have the appearance of that truth it would really possess, barring only the natural and unavoidable exaggeration to which all of us are prone when detailing events which have had powerful influence in exciting the imaginative faculties. 215164|3|0|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1721|Another reason was, that the incidents to be narrated were of a nature so positively marvellous, that, unsupported as my assertions must necessarily be (except by the evidence of a single individual, and he a half-breed Indian), I could only hope for belief among my family, and those of my friends who have had reason, through life, to put faith in my veracity–the probability being that the public at large would regard what I should put forth as merely an impudent and ingenious fiction. 215630|4|0|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

1738|It was a thousand wonders she did not broach to–Augustus having let go the tiller, as I said before, and I being too much agitated to think of taking it myself. 218890|6|10|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1739|By good luck, however, she kept steady, and gradually I recovered some degree of presence of mind. 219050|7|10|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1740|Still the wind was increasing fearfully, and whenever we rose from a plunge forward, the sea behind fell combing over our counter, and deluged us with water. 219148|8|10|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1741|I was so utterly benumbed, too, in every limb, as to be nearly unconscious of sensation. 219305|9|10|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1742|Leaving the bodies of the crew lying in the cabin, we got to work immediately at the pumps–Parker, of course, being set at liberty to assist us in the labour. 219393|0|100|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1743|Augustus's arm was bound up as well as we could effect it, and he did what he could, but that was not much. 219551|1|100|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1744|However, we found that we could just manage to keep the leak from gaining upon us by having one pump constantly going. 219658|2|100|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1745|As there were only four of us, this was severe labour; but we endeavoured to keep up our spirits, and looked anxiously for daybreak, when we hoped to lighten the brig by cutting away the mainmast. 219776|3|100|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1746|In this manner we passed a night of terrible anxiety and fatigue, and, when the day at length broke, the gale had neither abated in the least, nor were there any signs of its abating. 219972|0|101|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1747|We now dragged the bodies on deck and threw them overboard. 220155|1|101|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1748|Our next care was to get rid of the mainmast. 220214|2|101|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1749|The necessary preparations having been made, Peters cut away at the mast (having found axes in the cabin), while the rest of us stood by the stays and lanyards. 220259|3|101|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1750|As the brig gave a tremendous lee-lurch, the word was given to cut away the weather-lanyards, which being done, the whole mass of wood and rigging plunged into the sea, clear of the brig, and without doing any material injury. 220419|4|101|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1751|We now found that the vessel did not labour quite as much as before, but our situation was still exceedingly precarious, and in spite of the utmost exertions, we could not gain upon the leak without the aid of both pumps. 220645|5|101|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1752|The little assistance which Augustus could render us was not really of any importance. 220866|6|101|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1753|To add to our distress, a heavy sea, striking the brig to the windward, threw her off several points from the wind, and, before she could regain her position, another broke completely over her, and hurled her full upon her beam-ends. 220952|7|101|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1754|The ballast now shifted in a mass to leeward (the stowage had been knocking about perfectly at random for some time), and for a few moments we thought nothing could save us from capsizing. 221185|8|101|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1755|Presently, however, we partially righted; but the ballast still retaining its place to larboard, we lay so much along that it was useless to think of working the pumps, which indeed we could not have done much longer in any case, as our hands were entirely raw with the excessive labour we had undergone, and were bleeding in the most horrible manner. 221373|9|101|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1756|Contrary to Parker's advice, we now proceeded to cut away the foremast, and at length accomplished it after much difficulty, owing to the position in which we lay. 221724|0|102|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1757|In going overboard the wreck took with it the bowsprit, and left us a complete hulk. 221887|1|102|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1758|So far we had had reason to rejoice in the escape of our longboat, which had received no damage from any of the huge seas which had come on board. 221971|0|103|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1759|But we had not long to congratulate ourselves; for the foremast having gone, and, of course, the foresail with it, by which the brig had been steadied, every sea now made a complete breach over us, and in five minutes our deck was swept from stern to stern, the longboat and starboard bulwarks torn off, and even the windlass shattered into fragments. 222117|1|103|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1760|It was, indeed, hardly possible for us to be in a more pitiable condition. 222468|2|103|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1761|At noon there seemed to be some slight appearance of the gale's abating, but in this we were sadly disappointed, for it only lulled for a few minutes to blow with redoubled fury. 222542|0|104|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1762|About four in the afternoon it was utterly impossible to stand up against the violence of the blast; and, as the night closed in upon us, I had not a shadow of hope that the vessel would hold together until morning. 222720|1|104|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1763|By midnight we had settled very deep in the water, which was now up to the orlop deck. 222935|0|105|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1764|The rudder went soon afterward, the sea which tore it away lifting the after portion of the brig entirely from the water, against which she thumped in her descent with such a concussion as would be occasioned by going ashore. 223021|1|105|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1765|We had all calculated that the rudder would hold its own to the last, as it was unusually strong, being rigged as I have never seen one rigged either before or since. 223246|2|105|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1766|Down its main timber there ran a succession of stout iron hooks, and others in the same manner down the stern-post. 223412|3|105|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1767|Through these hooks there extended a very thick wrought-iron rod, the rudder being thus held to the stern-post and swinging freely on the rod. 223527|4|105|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1768|The tremendous force of the sea which tore it off may be estimated by the fact, that the hooks in the stern-post, which ran entirely through it, being clinched on the inside, were drawn every one of them completely out of the solid wood. 223669|5|105|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1769|We had scarcely time to draw breath after the violence of this shock, when one of the most tremendous waves I had then ever known broke right on board of us, sweeping the companion-way clear off, bursting in the hatchways, and firing every inch of the vessel with water. 223906|0|106|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1770|Luckily, just before night, all four of us had lashed ourselves firmly to the fragments of the windlass, lying in this manner as flat upon the deck as possible. 224176|0|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1771|This precaution alone saved us from destruction. 224336|1|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1772|It is not too much to say that our heads were not fairly out of the water more than one second in three. 224384|10|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1773|Although we lay close together, no one of us could see the other, or, indeed, any portion of the brig itself, upon which we were so tempestuously hurled about. 224488|11|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1774|At intervals we called one to the other, thus endeavouring to keep alive hope, and render consolation and encouragement to such of us as stood most in need of it. 224647|12|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1775|The feeble condition of Augustus made him an object of solicitude with us all; and as, from the lacerated condition of his right arm, it must have been impossible for him to secure his lashings with any degree of firmness, we were in momentary expectation of finding that he had gone overboard–yet to render him aid was a thing altogether out of the question. 224809|13|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1776|Fortunately, his station was more secure than that of any of the rest of us; for the upper part of his body lying just beneath a portion of the shattered windlass, the seas, as they tumbled in upon him, were greatly broken in their violence. 225168|14|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1777|In any other situation than this (into which he had been accidentally thrown after having lashed himself in a very exposed spot) he must inevitably have perished before morning. 225409|15|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1778|Owing to the brig's lying so much along, we were all less liable to be washed off than otherwise would have been the case. 225586|16|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1779|The heel, as I have before stated, was to larboard, about one half of the deck being constantly under water. 225708|17|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1780|The seas, therefore, which struck us to starboard were much broken, by the vessel's side, only reaching us in fragments as we lay flat on our faces; while those which came from larboard being what are called back-water seas, and obtaining little hold upon us on account of our posture, had not sufficient force to drag us from our fastenings. 225816|18|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1781|As it was, we were all more or less stunned by the immense weight of water which tumbled upon us, and which did not roll from above us until we were nearly exhausted. 226158|2|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1782|As soon as I could recover breath, I called aloud to my companions. 226324|3|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1783|"Augustus alone replied, saying: ""It is all over with us, and may God have mercy upon our souls""! 226391"|4|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1784|By-and-by both the others were enabled to speak, when they exhorted us to take courage, as there was still hope; it being impossible, from the nature of the cargo, that the brig could go down, and there being every chance that the gale would blow over by the morning. 226487|5|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1785|These words inspired me with new life; for, strange as it may seem, although it was obvious that a vessel with a cargo of empty oil-casks would not sink, I had been hitherto so confused in mind as to have overlooked this consideration altogether; and the danger which I had for some time regarded as the most imminent was that of foundering. 226754|6|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1786|As hope revived within me, I made use of every opportunity to strengthen the lashings which held me to the remains of the windlass, and in this occupation I soon discovered that my companions were also busy. 227095|7|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1787|The night was as dark as it could possibly be, and the horrible shrieking din and confusion which surrounded us it is useless to attempt describing. 227302|8|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1788|Our deck lay level with the sea, or rather we were encircled with a towering ridge of foam, a portion of which swept over us even instant. 227450|9|107|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1789|In this frightful situation we lay until the day broke so as to show us more fully the horrors which surrounded us. 227588|0|108|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1790|The brig was a mere log, rolling about at the mercy of every wave; the gale was upon the increase, if any thing, blowing indeed a complete hurricane, and there appeared to us no earthly prospect of deliverance. 227703|1|108|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1791|For several hours we held on in silence, expecting every moment that our lashings would either give way, that the remains of the windlass would go by the board, or that some of the huge seas, which roared in every direction around us and above us, would drive the hulk so far beneath the water that we should be drowned before it could regain the surface. 227913|2|108|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1792|By the mercy of God, however, we were preserved from these imminent dangers, and about midday were cheered by the light of the blessed sun. 228268|3|108|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1793|Shortly afterward we could perceive a sensible diminution in the force of the wind, when, now for the first time since the latter part of the evening before, Augustus spoke, asking Peters, who lay closest to him, if he thought there was any possibility of our being saved. 228407|4|108|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1794|As no reply was at first made to this question, we all concluded that the hybrid had been drowned where he lay; but presently, to our great joy, he spoke, although very feebly, saying that he was in great pain, being so cut by the tightness of his lashings across the stomach, that he must either find means of loosening them or perish, as it was impossible that he could endure his misery much longer. 228679|5|108|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1795|This occasioned us great distress, as it was altogether useless to think of aiding him in any manner while the sea continued washing over us as it did. 229081|6|108|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1796|We exhorted him to bear his sufferings with fortitude, and promised to seize the first opportunity which should offer itself to relieve him. 229232|7|108|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1797|He replied that it would soon be too late; that it would be all over with him before we could help him; and then, after moaning for some minutes, lay silent, when we concluded that he had perished. 229372|8|108|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1798|As the evening drew on, the sea had fAllan so much that scarcely more than one wave broke over the hulk from windward in the course of five minutes, and the wind had abated a great deal, although still blowing a severe gale. 229569|0|109|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1799|I had not heard any of my companions speak for hours, and now called to Augustus. 229793|1|109|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1800|He replied, although very feebly, so that I could not distinguish what he said. 229874|2|109|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1801|I then spoke to Peters and to Parker, neither of whom returned any answer. 229953|3|109|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1802|Hardly had I come to this resolution, when, suddenly, a loud and long scream or yell, as if from the throats of a thousand demons, seemed to pervade the whole atmosphere around and above the boat. 230027|0|11|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1803|Never while I live shall I forget the intense agony of terror I experienced at that moment. 230223|1|11|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1804|My hair stood erect on my head–I felt the blood congealing in my veins–my heart ceased utterly to beat, and without having once raised my eyes to learn the source of my alarm, I tumbled headlong and insensible upon the body of my fAllan companion. 230314|2|11|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1805|Shortly after this period I fell into a state of partial insensibility, during which the most pleasing images floated in my imagination; such as green trees, waving meadows of ripe grain, processions of dancing girls, troops of cavalry, and other phantasies. 230561|0|110|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1806|I now remember that, in all which passed before my mind's eye, motion was a predominant idea. 230819|1|110|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1807|Thus, I never fancied any stationary object, such as a house, a mountain, or any thing of that kind; but windmills, ships, large birds, balloons, people on horseback, carriages driving furiously, and similar moving objects, presented themselves in endless succession. 230912|2|110|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1808|When I recovered from this state, the sun was, as near as I could guess, an hour high. 231179|3|110|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1809|I had the greatest difficulty in bringing to recollection the various circumstances connected with my situation, and for some time remained firmly convinced that I was still in the hold of the brig, near the box, and that the body of Parker was that of Tiger. 231265|4|110|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1810|When I at length completely came to my senses, I found that the wind blew no more than a moderate breeze, and that the sea was comparatively calm; so much so that it only washed over the brig amidships. 231524|0|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1811|My left arm had broken loose from its lashings, and was much cut about the elbow; my right was entirely benumbed, and the hand and wrist swollen prodigiously by the pressure of the rope, which had worked from the shoulder downward. 231726|1|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1812|Upon mentioning this to Parker, he advised me to lie quiet for a few minutes, holding on to the windlass with my left hand, so as to allow time for the blood to circulate. 231957|10|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1813|Doing this, the numbness presently began to die away so that I could move first one of my legs, and then the other, and, shortly afterward I regained the partial use of my right arm. 232128|11|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1814|I now crawled with great caution toward Parker, without getting on my legs, and soon cut loose all the lashings about him, when, after a short delay, he also recovered the partial use of his limbs. 232310|12|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1815|We now lost no time in getting loose the rope from Peters. 232507|13|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1816|It had cut a deep gash through the waistband of his woollen pantaloons, and through two shirts, and made its way into his groin, from which the blood flowed out copiously as we removed the cordage. 232565|14|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1817|No sooner had we removed it, however, than he spoke, and seemed to experience instant relief–being able to move with much greater ease than either Parker or myself–this was no doubt owing to the discharge of blood. 232762|15|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1818|I was also in great pain from another rope which went about my waist, and had been drawn to an insufferable degree of tightness. 232976|2|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1819|Looking round upon my companions, I saw that Peters still lived, although a thick line was pulled so forcibly around his loins as to give him the appearance of being cut nearly in two; as I stiffed, he made a feeble motion to me with his hand, pointing to the rope. 233104|3|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1820|Augustus gave no indication of life whatever, and was bent nearly double across a splinter of the windlass. 233369|4|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1821|Parker spoke to me when he saw me moving, and asked me if I had not sufficient strength to release him from his situation, saying that if I would summon up what spirits I could, and contrive to untie him, we might yet save our lives; but that otherwise we must all perish. 233476|5|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1822|I told him to take courage, and I would endeavor to free him. 233748|6|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1823|Feeling in my pantaloons' pocket, I got hold of my penknife, and, after several ineffectual attempts, at length succeeded in opening it. 233809|7|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1824|I then, with my left hand, managed to free my right from its fastenings, and afterward cut the other ropes which held me. 233945|8|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1825|Upon attempting, however, to move from my position, I found that my legs failed me altogether, and that I could not get up; neither could I move my right arm in any direction. 234066|9|111|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1826|We had little hopes that Augustus would recover, as he evinced no signs of life; but, upon getting to him, we discovered that he had merely swooned from the loss of blood, the bandages we had placed around his wounded arm having been torn off by the water; none of the ropes which held him to the windlass were drawn sufficiently tight to occasion his death. 234241|0|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1827|Having relieved him from the fastenings, and got him clear of the broken wood about the windlass, we secured him in a dry place to windward, with his head somewhat lower than his body, and all three of us busied ourselves in chafing his limbs. 234599|1|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1828|When we put them on after this, they felt remarkably warm and pleasant, and served to invigorate us in no little degree. 234842|10|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1829|We helped Augustus off with his, and wrung them for him, when he experienced the same comfort. 234962|11|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1830|In about half an hour he came to himself, although it was not until the next morning that he gave signs of recognizing any of us, or had sufficient strength to speak. 235056|2|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1831|By the time we had thus got clear of our lashings it was quite dark, and it began to cloud up, so that we were again in the greatest agony lest it should come on to blow hard, in which event nothing could have saved us from perishing, exhausted as we were. 235222|3|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1832|By good fortune it continued very moderate during the night, the sea subsiding every minute, which gave us great hopes of ultimate preservation. 235478|4|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1833|A gentle breeze still blew from the N. W., but the weather was not at all cold. 235622|5|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1834|Augustus was lashed carefully to windward in such a manner as to prevent him from slipping overboard with the rolls of the vessel, as he was still too weak to hold on at all. 235701|6|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1835|For ourselves there was no such necessity. 235875|7|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1836|We sat close together, supporting each other with the aid of the broken ropes about the windlass, and devising methods of escape from our frightful situation. 235917|8|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1837|We derived much comfort from taking off our clothes and wringing the water from them. 236075|9|112|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1838|Our chief sufferings were now those of hunger and thirst, and when we looked forward to the means of relief in this respect, our hearts sunk within us, and we were induced to regret that we had escaped the less dreadful perils of the sea. 236160|0|113|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1839|We endeavoured, however, to console ourselves with the hope of being speedily picked up by some vessel and encouraged each other to bear with fortitude the evils that might happen. 236398|1|113|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1840|The morning of the fourteenth at length dawned, and the weather still continued clear and pleasant, with a steady but very light breeze from the N. W. The sea was now quite smooth, and as, from some cause which we could not determine, the brig did not he so much along as she had done before, the deck was comparatively dry, and we could move about with freedom. 236578|0|114|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1841|We had now been better than three entire days and nights without either food or drink, and it became absolutely necessary that we should make an attempt to get up something from below. 236940|1|114|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1842|As the brig was completely full of water, we went to this work despondently, and with but little expectation of being able to obtain anything. 237124|2|114|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1843|We made a kind of drag by driving some nails which we broke out from the remains of the companion-hatch into two pieces of wood. 237266|3|114|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1844|Tying these across each other, and fastening them to the end of a rope, we threw them into the cabin, and dragged them to and fro, in the faint hope of being thus able to entangle some article which might be of use to us for food, or which might at least render us assistance in getting it. 237394|4|114|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1845|We spent the greater part of the morning in this labour without effect, fishing up nothing more than a few bedclothes, which were readily caught by the nails. 237684|5|114|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1846|Indeed, our contrivance was so very clumsy that any greater success was hardly to be anticipated. 237842|6|114|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1847|We now tried the forecastle, but equally in vain, and were upon the brink of despair, when Peters proposed that we should fasten a rope to his body, and let him make an attempt to get up something by diving into the cabin. 237939|0|115|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1848|This proposition we hailed with all the delight which reviving hope could inspire. 238161|1|115|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1849|He proceeded immediately to strip off his clothes with the exception of his pantaloons; and a strong rope was then carefully fastened around his middle, being brought up over his shoulders in such a manner that there was no possibility of its slipping. 238243|2|115|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1850|The undertaking was one of great difficulty and danger; for, as we could hardly expect to find much, if any, provision in the cabin itself, it was necessary that the diver, after letting himself down, should make a turn to the right, and proceed under water a distance of ten or twelve feet, in a narrow passage, to the storeroom, and return, without drawing breath. 238495|3|115|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1851|Everything being ready, Peters now descended in the cabin, going down the companion-ladder until the water reached his chin. 238861|0|116|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1852|He then plunged in, head first, turning to the right as he plunged, and endeavouring to make his way to the storeroom. 238985|1|116|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1853|In this first attempt, however, he was altogether unsuccessful. 239103|2|116|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1854|In less than half a minute after his going down we felt the rope jerked violently (the signal we had agreed upon when he desired to be drawn up). 239166|3|116|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1855|We accordingly drew him up instantly, but so incautiously as to bruise him badly against the ladder. 239311|4|116|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1856|He had brought nothing with him, and had been unable to penetrate more than a very little way into the passage, owing to the constant exertions he found it necessary to make in order to keep himself from floating up against the deck. 239411|5|116|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1857|Upon getting out he was very much exhausted, and had to rest full fifteen minutes before he could again venture to descend. 239644|6|116|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1858|The second attempt met with even worse success; for he remained so long under water without giving the signal, that, becoming alarmed for his safety, we drew him out without it, and found that he was almost at the last gasp, having, as he said, repeatedly jerked at the rope without our feeling it. 239767|0|117|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1859|This was probably owing to a portion of it having become entangled in the balustrade at the foot of the ladder. 240065|1|117|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1860|This balustrade was, indeed, so much in the way, that we determined to remove it, if possible, before proceeding with our design. 240176|2|117|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1861|As we had no means of getting it away except by main force, we all descended into the water as far as we could on the ladder, and giving a pull against it with our united strength, succeeded in breaking it down. 240305|3|117|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1862|The third attempt was equally unsuccessful with the two first, and it now became evident that nothing could be done in this manner without the aid of some weight with which the diver might steady himself, and keep to the floor of the cabin while making his search. 240516|0|118|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1863|For a long time we looked about in vain for something which might answer this purpose; but at length, to our great joy, we discovered one of the weather-forechains so loose that we had not the least difficulty in wrenching it off. 240780|1|118|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1864|Having fastened this securely to one of his ankles, Peters now made his fourth descent into the cabin, and this time succeeded in making his way to the door of the steward's room. 241010|2|118|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1865|To his inexpressible grief, however, he found it locked, and was obliged to return without effecting an entrance, as, with the greatest exertion, he could remain under water not more, at the utmost extent, than a single minute. 241189|3|118|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1866|Our affairs now looked gloomy indeed, and neither Augustus nor myself could refrain from bursting into tears, as we thought of the host of difficulties which encompassed us, and the slight probability which existed of our finally making an escape. 241416|4|118|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1867|But this weakness was not of long duration. 241663|5|118|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1868|Throwing ourselves on our knees to God, we implored His aid in the many dangers which beset us; and arose with renewed hope and vigor to think what could yet be done by mortal means toward accomplishing our deliverance. 241706|6|118|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1869|Shortly afterward an incident occurred which I am induced to look upon as more intensely productive of emotion, as far more replete with the extremes first of delight and then of horror, than even any of the thousand chances which afterward befell me in nine long years, crowded with events of the most startling and, in many cases, of the most unconceived and unconceivable character. 241925|0|119|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1870|We were lying on the deck near the companion-way, and debating the possibility of yet making our way into the storeroom, when, looking toward Augustus, who lay fronting myself, I perceived that he had become all at once deadly pale, and that his lips were quivering in the most singular and unaccountable manner. 242310|1|119|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1871|Greatly alarmed, I spoke to him, but he made me no reply, and I was beginning to think that he was suddenly taken ill, when I took notice of his eyes, which were glaring apparently at some object behind me. 242622|2|119|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1872|I turned my head, and shall never forget the ecstatic joy which thrilled through every particle of my frame, when I perceived a large brig bearing down upon us, and not more than a couple of miles off. 242828|3|119|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1873|I sprung to my feet as if a musket bullet had suddenly struck me to the heart; and, stretching out my arms in the direction of the vessel, stood in this manner, motionless, and unable to articulate a syllable. 243029|4|119|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1874|Peters and Parker were equally affected, although in different ways. 243238|5|119|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1875|The former danced about the deck like a madman, uttering the most extravagant rhodomontades, intermingled with howls and imprecations, while the latter burst into tears, and continued for many minutes weeping like a child. 243306|6|119|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1876|I found myself, upon reviving, in the cabin of a large whaling-ship (the Penguin) bound to Nantucket. 243528|0|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1877|Several persons were standing over me, and Augustus, paler than death, was busily occupied in chafing my hands. 243629|1|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1878|"A discussion ensued, when Block grew angry, and, after a while, said that ""it was no business of his to be eternally watching for egg-shells; that the ship should not put about for any such nonsense; and if there was a man run down, it was nobody's fault but Henderson, the first mate, now took the matter up, being justly indignant, as well as the whole ship's crew, at a speech evincing so base a degree of heartless atrocity. 243740"|10|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1879|He spoke plainly, seeing himself upheld by the men, told the captain he considered him a fit subject for the gallows, and that he would disobey his orders if he were hanged for it the moment he set his foot on shore. 244168|11|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1880|He strode aft, jostling Block (who turned pale and made no answer) on one side, and seizing the helm, gave the word, in a firm voice, Hard-a-lee! 244384|12|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1881|The men flew to their posts, and the ship went cleverly about. 244529|13|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1882|All this had occupied nearly five minutes, and it was supposed to be hardly within the bounds of possibility that any individual could be saved–allowing any to have been on board the boat. 244591|14|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1883|Yet, as the reader has seen, both Augustus and myself were rescued; and our deliverance seemed to have been brought about by two of those almost inconceivable pieces of good fortune which are attributed by the wise and pious to the special interference of Providence. 244779|15|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1884|Upon seeing me open my eyes, his exclamations of gratitude and joy excited alternate laughter and tears from the rough-looking personages who were present. 245046|2|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1885|The mystery of our being in existence was now soon explained. 245201|3|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1886|We had been run down by the whaling-ship, which was close-hauled, beating up to Nantucket with every sail she could venture to set, and consequently running almost at right angles to our own course. 245262|4|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1887|Several men were on the look-out forward, but did not perceive our boat until it was an impossibility to avoid coming in contact–their shouts of warning upon seeing us were what so terribly alarmed me. 245460|5|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1888|The huge ship, I was told, rode immediately over us with as much ease as our own little vessel would have passed over a feather, and without the least perceptible impediment to her progress. 245661|6|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1889|Not a scream arose from the deck of the victim–there was a slight grating sound to be heard mingling with the roar of wind and water, as the frail bark which was swallowed up rubbed for a moment along the keel of her destroyer–but this was all. 245851|7|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1890|Thinking our boat (which it will be remembered was dismasted) some mere shell cut adrift as useless, the captain (Captain E. T. V. Block, of New London) was for proceeding on his course without troubling himself further about the matter. 246095|8|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1891|Luckily, there were two of the look-out who swore positively to having seen some person at our helm, and represented the possibility of yet saving him. 246332|9|12|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1892|The vessel in sight was a large hermaphrodite brig, of a Dutch build, and painted black, with a tawdry gilt figure-head. 246483|0|120|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1893|She had evidently seen a good deal of rough weather, and, we supposed, had suffered much in the gale which had proved so disastrous to ourselves; for her foretopmast was gone, and some of her starboard bulwarks. 246603|1|120|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1894|When we first saw her, she was, as I have already said, about two miles off and to windward, bearing down upon us. 246814|2|120|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1895|The breeze was very gentle, and what astonished us chiefly was, that she had no other sails set than her foremast and mainsail, with a flying jib–of course she came down but slowly, and our impatience amounted nearly to phrensy. 246928|3|120|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1896|The awkward manner in which she steered, too, was remarked by all of us, even excited as we were. 247156|4|120|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1897|She yawed about so considerably, that once or twice we thought it impossible she could see us, or imagined that, having seen us, and discovered no person on board, she was about to tack and make off in another direction. 247253|5|120|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1898|Upon each of these occasions we screamed and shouted at the top of our voices, when the stranger would appear to change for a moment her intention, and again hold on toward us–this singular conduct being repeated two or three times, so that at last we could think of no other manner of accounting for it than by supposing the helmsman to be in liquor. 247473|6|120|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1899|No person was seen upon her decks until she arrived within about a quarter of a mile of us. 247824|0|121|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1900|We then saw three seamen, whom by their dress we took to be Hollanders. 247915|1|121|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1901|Two of these were lying on some old sails near the forecastle, and the third, who appeared to be looking at us with great curiosity, was leaning over the starboard bow near the bowsprit. 247986|2|121|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1902|This last was a stout and tall man, with a very dark skin. 248172|3|121|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1903|He seemed by his manner to be encouraging us to have patience, nodding to us in a cheerful although rather odd way, and smiling constantly, so as to display a set of the most brilliantly white teeth. 248230|4|121|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1904|As his vessel drew nearer, we saw a red flannel cap which he had on fall from his head into the water; but of this he took little or no notice, continuing his odd smiles and gesticulations. 248429|5|121|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1905|I relate these things and circumstances minutely, and I relate them, it must be understood, precisely as they appeared to us. 248618|6|121|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1906|The brig came on slowly, and now more steadily than before, and–I cannot speak calmly of this event-our hearts leaped up wildly within us, and we poured out our whole souls in shouts and thanksgiving to God for the complete, unexpected, and glorious deliverance that was so palpably at hand. 248743|0|122|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1907|Of a sudden, and all at once, there came wafted over the ocean from the strange vessel (which was now close upon us) a smell, a stench, such as the whole world has no name for–no conception of–hellish–utterly suffocating–insufferable, inconceivable. 249034|1|122|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1908|We were raving with horror and despair–thoroughly mad through the anguish of our grievous disappointment. 249283|10|122|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1909|I gasped for breath, and turning to my companions, perceived that they were paler than marble. 249388|2|122|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1910|But we had now no time left for question or surmise–the brig was within fifty feet of us, and it seemed to be her intention to run under our counter, that we might board her without putting out a boat. 249482|3|122|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1911|We rushed aft, when, suddenly, a wide yaw threw her off full five or six points from the course she had been running, and, as she passed under our stern at the distance of about twenty feet, we had a full view of her decks. 249683|4|122|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1912|Shall I ever forget the triple horror of that spectacle? 249906|5|122|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1913|Twenty-five or thirty human bodies, among whom were several females, lay scattered about between the counter and the galley in the last and most loathsome state of putrefaction. 249962|6|122|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1914|We plainly saw that not a soul lived in that fated vessel! 250139|7|122|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1915|Yet we could not help shouting to the dead for help! 250197|8|122|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1916|Yes, long and loudly did we beg, in the agony of the moment, that those silent and disgusting images would stay for us, would not abandon us to become like them, would receive us among their goodly company! 250249|9|122|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1917|As our first loud yell of terror broke forth, it was replied to by something, from near the bowsprit of the stranger, so closely resembling the scream of a human voice that the nicest ear might have been startled and deceived. 250455|0|123|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1918|At this instant another sudden yaw brought the region of the forecastle for a moment into view, and we beheld at once the origin of the sound. 250681|1|123|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1919|I sprang forward quickly, and, with a deep shudder, threw the frightful thing into the sea. 250823|10|123|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1920|We saw the tall stout figure still leaning on the bulwark, and still nodding his head to and fro, but his face was now turned from us so that we could not behold it. 250914|2|123|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1921|His arms were extended over the rail, and the palms of his hands fell outward. 251079|3|123|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1922|His knees were lodged upon a stout rope, tightly stretched, and reaching from the heel of the bowsprit to a cathead. 251157|4|123|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1923|On his back, from which a portion of the shirt had been torn, leaving it bare, there sat a huge sea-gull, busily gorging itself with the horrible flesh, its bill and talons deep buried, and its white plumage spattered all over with blood. 251273|5|123|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1924|As the brig moved farther round so as to bring us close in view, the bird, with much apparent difficulty, drew out its crimsoned head, and, after eyeing us for a moment as if stupefied, arose lazily from the body upon which it had been feasting, and, flying directly above our deck, hovered there a while with a portion of clotted and liver-like substance in its beak. 251511|6|123|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1925|The horrid morsel dropped at length with a sullen splash immediately at the feet of Parker. 251879|7|123|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1926|May God forgive me, but now, for the first time, there flashed through my mind a thought, a thought which I will not mention, and I felt myself making a step toward the ensanguined spot. 251970|8|123|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1927|I looked upward, and the eyes of Augustus met my own with a degree of intense and eager meaning which immediately brought me to my senses. 252156|9|123|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1928|The body from which it had been taken, resting as it did upon the rope, had been easily swayed to and fro by the exertions of the carnivorous bird, and it was this motion which had at first impressed us with the belief of its being alive. 252294|0|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1929|As the gull relieved it of its weight, it swung round and fell partially over, so that the face was fully discovered. 252532|1|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1930|too late. 252649|10|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1931|How much our intellects had been weakened by this incident may be estimated by the fact, that when the vessel had proceeded so far that we could perceive no more than the half of her hull, the proposition was seriously entertained of attempting to overtake her by swimming! 252658|11|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1932|Never, surely, was any object so terribly full of awe! 252931|2|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1933|The eyes were gone, and the whole flesh around the mouth, leaving the teeth utterly naked. 252985|3|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1934|This, then, was the smile which had cheered us on to hope! 253075|4|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1935|this the–but I forbear. 253133|5|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1936|The brig, as I have already told, passed under our stern, and made its way slowly but steadily to leeward. 253156|6|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1937|With her and with her terrible crew went all our gay visions of deliverance and joy. 253262|7|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1938|Deliberately as she went by, we might possibly have found means of boarding her, had not our sudden disappointment and the appalling nature of the discovery which accompanied it laid entirely prostrate every active faculty of mind and body. 253346|8|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1939|We had seen and felt, but we could neither think nor act, until, alas! 253586|9|124|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1940|I have, since this period, vainly endeavoured to obtain some clew to the hideous uncertainty which enveloped the fate of the stranger. 253656|0|125|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1941|Her build and general appearance, as I have before stated, led us to the belief that she was a Dutch trader, and the dresses of the crew also sustained this opinion. 253790|1|125|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1942|We might have easily seen the name upon her stern, and, indeed, taken other observations, which would have guided us in making out her character; but the intense excitement of the moment blinded us to every thing of that nature. 253955|2|125|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1943|From the saffron-like hue of such of the corpses as were not entirely decayed, we concluded that the whole of her company had perished by the yellow fever, or some other virulent disease of the same fearful kind. 254183|3|125|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1944|If such were the case (and I know not what else to imagine), death, to judge from the positions of the bodies, must have come upon them in a manner awfully sudden and overwhelming, in a way totally distinct from that which generally characterizes even the most deadly pestilences with which mankind are acquainted. 254395|4|125|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1945|It is possible, indeed, that poison, accidentally introduced into some of their sea-stores, may have brought about the disaster, or that the eating of some unknown venomous species of fish, or other marine animal, or oceanic bird, might have induced it,–but it is utterly useless to form conjectures where all is involved, and will, no doubt, remain for ever involved, in the most appalling and unfathomable mystery. 254709|5|125|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1946|We spent the remainder of the day in a condition of stupid lethargy, gazing after the retreating vessel until the darkness, hiding her from our sight, recalled us in some measure to our senses. 255125|0|126|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1947|The pangs of hunger and thirst then returned, absorbing all other cares and considerations. 255318|1|126|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1948|Nothing, however, could be done until the morning, and, securing ourselves as well as possible, we endeavoured to snatch a little repose. 255409|2|126|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1949|In this I succeeded beyond my expectations, sleeping until my companions, who had not been so fortunate, aroused me at daybreak to renew our attempts at getting up provisions from the hull. 255546|3|126|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1950|It was now a dead calm, with the sea as smooth as I have ever known it,–the weather warm and pleasant. 255735|0|127|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1951|The brig was out of sight. 255837|1|127|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1952|We commenced our operations by wrenching off, with some trouble, another of the forechains; and having fastened both to Peters' feet, he again made an endeavour to reach the door of the storeroom, thinking it possible that he might be able to force it open, provided he could get at it in sufficient time; and this he hoped to do, as the hulk lay much more steadily than before. 255863|2|127|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1953|He succeeded very quickly in reaching the door, when, loosening one of the chains from his ankle, be made every exertion to force the passage with it, but in vain, the framework of the room being far stronger than was anticipated. 256241|0|128|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1954|He was quite exhausted with his long stay under water, and it became absolutely necessary that some other one of us should take his place. 256471|1|128|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1955|For this service Parker immediately volunteered; but, after making three ineffectual efforts, found that he could never even succeed in getting near the door. 256609|2|128|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1956|The condition of Augustus's wounded arm rendered it useless for him to attempt going down, as he would be unable to force the room open should be reach it, and it accordingly now devolved upon me to exert myself for our common deliverance. 256767|3|128|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1957|Peters had left one of the chains in the passage, and I found, upon plunging in, that I had not sufficient balance to keep me firmly down. 257006|0|129|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1958|I determined, therefore, to attempt no more, in my first effort, than merely to recover the other chain. 257144|1|129|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1959|In groping along the floor of the passage for this, I felt a hard substance, which I immediately grasped, not having time to ascertain what it was, but returning and ascending instantly to the surface. 257248|2|129|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1960|The prize proved to be a bottle, and our joy may be conceived when I say that it was found to be full of port wine. 257449|3|129|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1961|Giving thanks to God for this timely and cheering assistance, we immediately drew the cork with my penknife, and, each taking a moderate sup, felt the most indescribable comfort from the warmth, strength, and spirits with which it inspired us. 257564|4|129|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1962|We then carefully recorked the bottle, and, by means of a handkerchief, swung it in such a manner that there was no possibility of its getting broken. 257807|5|129|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1963|While the ship was yet in stays, the mate lowered the jolly-boat and jumped into her with the very two men, I believe, who spoke up as having seen me at the helm. 257957|0|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1964|They had just left the lee of the vessel (the moon still shining brightly) when she made a long and heavy roll to windward, and Henderson, at the same moment, starting up in his seat bawled out to his crew to back water. 258119|1|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1965|The head of the bolt had made its way through the collar of the green baize jacket I had on, and through the back part of my neck, forcing itself out between two sinews and just below the right ear. 258339|10|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1966|I was immediately put to bed–although life seemed to be totally extinct. 258537|11|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1967|There was no surgeon on board. 258609|12|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1968|The captain, however, treated me with every attention–to make amends, I presume, in the eyes of his crew, for his atrocious behaviour in the previous portion of the adventure. 258639|13|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1969|He would say nothing else–repeating his cry impatiently, back water! 258814|2|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1970|black water! 258882|3|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1971|The men put back as speedily as possible, but by this time the ship had gone round, and gotten fully under headway, although all hands on board were making great exertions to take in sail. 258894|4|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1972|In despite of the danger of the attempt, the mate clung to the main-chains as soon as they came within his reach. 259082|5|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1973|Another huge lurch now brought the starboard side of the vessel out of water nearly as far as her keel, when the cause of his anxiety was rendered obvious enough. 259195|6|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1974|The body of a man was seen to be affixed in the most singular manner to the smooth and shining bottom (the Penguin was coppered and copper-fastened), and beating violently against it with every movement of the hull. 259357|7|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1975|After several ineffectual efforts, made during the lurches of the ship, and at the imminent risk of swamping the boat I was finally disengaged from my perilous situation and taken on board–for the body proved to be my own. 259572|8|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1976|It appeared that one of the timber-bolts having started and broken a passage through the copper, it had arrested my progress as I passed under the ship, and fastened me in so extraordinary a manner to her bottom. 259794|9|13|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1977|Having rested a while after this fortunate discovery, I again descended, and now recovered the chain, with which I instantly came up. 260006|0|130|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1978|I then fastened it on and went down for the third time, when I became fully satisfied that no exertions whatever, in that situation, would enable me to force open the door of the storeroom. 260139|1|130|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1979|I therefore returned in despair. 260328|2|130|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1980|There seemed now to be no longer any room for hope, and I could perceive in the countenances of my companions that they had made up their minds to perish. 260360|0|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1981|The wine had evidently produced in them a species of delirium, which, perhaps, I had been prevented from feeling by the immersion I had undergone since drinking it. 260514|1|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1982|I remonstrated with them on the heartlessness of their conduct, when Augustus burst into tears. 260678|10|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1983|The other two endeavoured to laugh the matter off as a joke, but I hope never again to behold laughter of such a species: the distortion of countenance was absolutely frightful. 260773|11|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1984|Indeed, it was apparent that the stimulus, in the empty state of their stomachs, had taken instant and violent effect, and that they were all exceedingly intoxicated. 260950|12|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1985|With great difficulty I prevailed upon them to lie down, when they fell very soon into a heavy slumber, accompanied with loud stertorous breathing. 261116|13|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1986|I now found myself, as it were, alone in the brig, and my reflections, to be sure, were of the most fearful and gloomy nature. 261263|14|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1987|No prospect offered itself to my view but a lingering death by famine, or, at the best, by being overwhelmed in the first gale which should spring up, for in our present exhausted condition we could have no hope of living through another. 261389|15|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1988|They talked incoherently, and about matters unconnected with our condition, Peters repeatedly asking me questions about Nantucket. 261627|2|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1989|Augustus, too, I remember, approached me with a serious air, and requested me to lend him a pocket-comb, as his hair was full of fish-scales, and he wished to get them out before going on shore. 261757|3|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1990|Parker appeared somewhat less affected, and urged me to dive at random into the cabin, and bring up any article which might come to hand. 261951|4|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1991|To this I consented, and, in the first attempt, after staying under a full minute, brought up a small leather trunk belonging to Captain Barnard. 262088|5|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1992|This was immediately opened in the faint hope that it might contain something to eat or drink. 262233|6|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1993|We found nothing, however, except a box of razors and two linen shirts. 262327|7|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1994|I now went down again, and returned without any success. 262398|8|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1995|As my head came above water I heard a crash on deck, and, upon getting up, saw that my companions had ungratefully taken advantage of my absence to drink the remainder of the wine, having let the bottle fall in the endeavour to replace it before I saw them. 262454|9|131|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1996|The gnawing hunger which I now experienced was nearly insupportable, and I felt myself capable of going to any lengths in order to appease it. 262711|0|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1997|With my knife I cut off a small portion of the leather trunk, and endeavoured to eat it, but found it utterly impossible to swallow a single morsel, although I fancied that some little alleviation of my suffering was obtained by chewing small pieces of it and spitting them out. 262853|1|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1998|Having explained my object, he expressed himself indebted to me, and said that he felt greatly better from the immersion, afterward conversing sensibly upon our situation. 263131|10|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
1999|We then resolved to treat Augustus and Peters in the same way, which we immediately did, when they both experienced much benefit from the shock. 263302|11|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2000|This idea of sudden immersion had been suggested to me by reading in some medical work the good effect of the shower-bath in a case where the patient was suffering from mania a potu. 263446|12|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2001|Toward night my companions awoke, one by one, each in an indescribable state of weakness and horror, brought on by the wine, whose fumes had now evaporated. 263628|2|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2002|They shook as if with a violent ague, and uttered the most lamentable cries for water. 263784|3|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2003|Their condition affected me in the most lively degree, at the same time causing me to rejoice in the fortunate train of circumstances which had prevented me from indulging in the wine, and consequently from sharing their melancholy and most distressing sensations. 263870|4|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2004|Their conduct, however, gave me great uneasiness and alarm; for it was evident that, unless some favourable change took place, they could afford me no assistance in providing for our common safety. 264134|5|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2005|I had not yet abandoned all idea being able to get up something from below; but the attempt could not possibly be resumed until some one of them was sufficiently master of himself to aid me by holding the end of the rope while I went down. 264331|6|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2006|Parker appeared to be somewhat more in possession of his senses than the others, and I endeavoured, by every means in my power, to rouse him. 264570|7|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2007|Thinking that a plunge in the sea-water might have a beneficial effect, I contrived to fasten the end of a rope around his body, and then, leading him to the companion-way (he remaining quite passive all the while), pushed him in, and immediately drew him out. 264711|8|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2008|I had good reason to congratulate myself upon having made this experiment; for he appeared much revived and invigorated, and, upon getting out, asked me, in a rational manner, why I had so served him. 264971|9|132|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2009|Finding that I could now trust my companions to hold the end of the rope, I again made three or four plunges into the cabin, although it was now quite dark, and a gentle but long swell from the northward rendered the hulk somewhat unsteady. 265171|0|133|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2010|In the course of these attempts I succeeded in bringing up two case-knives, a three-gallon jug, empty, and a blanket, but nothing which could serve us for food. 265411|1|133|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2011|I continued my efforts, after getting these articles, until I was completely exhausted, but brought up nothing else. 265571|2|133|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2012|During the night Parker and Peters occupied themselves by turns in the same manner; but nothing coming to hand, we now gave up this attempt in despair, concluding that we were exhausting ourselves in vain. 265687|3|133|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2013|We passed the remainder of this night in a state of the most intense mental and bodily anguish that can possibly be imagined. 265892|0|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2014|The morning of the sixteenth at length dawned, and we looked eagerly around the horizon for relief, but to no purpose. 266017|1|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2015|At intervals, however, they would appear to revive suddenly, as if inspired all at once with a consciousness of their condition, when they would spring upon their feet in a momentary flash of vigour, and speak, for a short period, of their prospects, in a manner altogether rational, although full of the most intense despair. 266135|10|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2016|It is possible, however, that my companions may have entertained the same opinion of their own condition as I did of mine, and that I may have unwittingly been guilty of the same extravagances and imbecilities as themselves–this is a matter which cannot be determined. 266461|11|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2017|The sea was still smooth, with only a long swell from the northward, as on yesterday. 266729|2|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2018|This was the sixth day since we had tasted either food or drink, with the exception of the bottle of port wine, and it was clear that we could hold out but a very little while longer unless something could be obtained. 266814|3|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2019|I never saw before, nor wish to see again, human beings so utterly emaciated as Peters and Augustus. 267032|4|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2020|Had I met them on shore in their present condition I should not have had the slightest suspicion that I had ever beheld them. 267132|5|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2021|Their countenances were totally changed in character, so that I could not bring myself to believe them really the same individuals with whom I had been in company but a few days before. 267257|6|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2022|Parker, although sadly reduced, and so feeble that he could not raise his head from his bosom, was not so far gone as the other two. 267442|7|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2023|He suffered with great patience, making no complaint, and endeavouring to inspire us with hope in every manner he could devise. 267574|8|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2024|For myself, although at the commencement of the voyage I had been in bad health, and was at all times of a delicate constitution, I suffered less than any of us, being much less reduced in frame, and retaining my powers of mind in a surprising degree, while the rest were completely prostrated in intellect, and seemed to be brought to a species of second childhood, generally simpering in their expressions, with idiotic smiles, and uttering the most absurd platitudes. 267701|9|134|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2025|About noon Parker declared that he saw land off the larboard quarter, and it was with the utmost difficulty I could restrain him from plunging into the sea with the view of swimming toward it. 268171|0|135|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2026|Peters and Augustus took little notice of what he said, being apparently wrapped up in moody contemplation. 268363|1|135|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2027|Upon looking in the direction pointed out, I could not perceive the faintest appearance of the shore–indeed, I was too well aware that we were far from any land to indulge in a hope of that nature. 268470|2|135|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2028|It was a long time, nevertheless, before I could convince Parker of his mistake. 268667|3|135|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2029|He then burst into a flood of tears, weeping like a child, with loud cries and sobs, for two or three hours, when becoming exhausted, he fell asleep. 268747|4|135|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2030|Peters and Augustus now made several ineffectual efforts to swallow portions of the leather. 268896|0|136|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2031|I advised them to chew it and spit it out; but they were too excessively debilitated to be able to follow my advice. 268988|1|136|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2032|I continued to chew pieces of it at intervals, and found some relief from so doing; my chief distress was for water, and I was only prevented from taking a draught from the sea by remembering the horrible consequences which thus have resulted to others who were similarly situated with ourselves. 269104|2|136|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2033|The day wore on in this manner, when I suddenly discovered a sail to the eastward, and on our larboard bow. 269400|0|137|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2034|She appeared to be a large ship, and was coming nearly athwart us, being probably twelve or fifteen miles distant. 269507|1|137|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2035|None of my companions had as yet discovered her, and I forbore to tell them of her for the present, lest we might again be disappointed of relief. 269621|2|137|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2036|At length upon her getting nearer, I saw distinctly that she was heading immediately for us, with her light sails filled. 269767|3|137|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2037|I could now contain myself no longer, and pointed her out to my fellow-sufferers. 269888|4|137|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2038|They immediately sprang to their feet, again indulging in the most extravagant demonstrations of joy, weeping, laughing in an idiotic manner, jumping, stamping upon the deck, tearing their hair, and praying and cursing by turns. 269969|5|137|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2039|I was so affected by their conduct, as well as by what I considered a sure prospect of deliverance, that I could not refrain from joining in with their madness, and gave way to the impulses of my gratitude and ecstasy by lying and rolling on the deck, clapping my hands, shouting, and other similar acts, until I was suddenly called to my recollection, and once more to the extreme human misery and despair, by perceiving the ship all at once with her stern fully presented toward us, and steering in a direction nearly opposite to that in which I had at first perceived her. 270197|6|137|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2040|It was some time before I could induce my poor companions to believe that this sad reverse in our prospects had actually taken place. 270772|0|138|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2041|They replied to all my assertions with a stare and a gesture implying that they were not to be deceived by such misrepresentations. 270905|1|138|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2042|The conduct of Augustus most sensibly affected me. 271036|2|138|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2043|In spite of all I could say or do to the contrary, he persisted in saying that the ship was rapidly nearing us, and in making preparations to go on board of her. 271086|3|138|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2044|Some seaweed floating by the brig, he maintained that it was the ship's boat, and endeavoured to throw himself upon it, howling and shrieking in the most heartrending manner, when I forcibly restrained him from thus casting himself into the sea. 271247|4|138|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2045|Having become in some degree pacified, we continued to watch the ship until we finally lost sight of her, the weather becoming hazy, with a light breeze springing up. 271492|0|139|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2046|As soon as she was entirely gone, Parker turned suddenly toward me with an expression of countenance which made me shudder. 271658|1|139|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2047|There was about him an air of self-possession which I had not noticed in him until now, and before he opened his lips my heart told me what he would say. 271781|2|139|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2048|He proposed, in a few words, that one of us should die to preserve the existence of the others. 271934|3|139|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2049|In the meantime, Henderson had again put off from the ship, although the wind was now blowing almost a hurricane. 272029|0|14|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2050|He had not been gone many minutes when he fell in with some fragments of our boat, and shortly afterward one of the men with him asserted that he could distinguish a cry for help at intervals amid the roaring of the tempest. 272142|1|14|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2051|This induced the hardy seamen to persevere in their search for more than half an hour, although repeated signals to return were made them by Captain Block, and although every moment on the water in so frail a boat was fraught to them with the most imminent and deadly peril. 272366|2|14|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2052|Indeed, it is nearly impossible to conceive how the small jolly they were in could have escaped destruction for a single instant. 272640|3|14|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2053|She was built, however, for the whaling service, and was fitted, as I have since had reason to believe, with air-boxes, in the manner of some life-boats used on the coast of Wales. 272769|4|14|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2054|I had for some time past, dwelt upon the prospect of our being reduced to this last horrible extremity, and had secretly made up my mind to suffer death in any shape or under any circumstances rather than resort to such a course. 272949|0|140|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2055|Nor was this resolution in any degree weakened by the present intensity of hunger under which I laboured. 273178|1|140|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2056|The proposition had not been heard by either Peters or Augustus. 273283|2|140|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2057|I therefore took Parker aside; and mentally praying to God for power to dissuade him from the horrible purpose he entertained, I expostulated with him for a long time, and in the most supplicating manner, begging him in the name of every thing which he held sacred, and urging him by every species of argument which the extremity of the case suggested, to abandon the idea, and not to mention it to either of the other two. 273347|3|140|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2058|He heard all I said without attempting to controvert any of my arguments, and I had begun to hope that he would be prevailed upon to do as I desired. 273770|0|141|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2059|But when I had ceased speaking, he said that he knew very well all I had said was true, and that to resort to such a course was the most horrible alternative which could enter into the mind of man; but that he had now held out as long as human nature could be sustained; that it was unnecessary for all to perish, when, by the death of one, it was possible, and even probable, that the rest might be finally preserved; adding that I might save myself the trouble of trying to turn him from his purpose, his mind having been thoroughly made up on the subject even before the appearance of the ship, and that only her heaving in sight had prevented him from mentioning his intention at an earlier period. 273919|1|141|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2060|I now begged him, if he would not be prevailed upon to abandon his design, at least to defer it for another day, when some vessel might come to our relief; again reiterating every argument I could devise, and which I thought likely to have influence with one of his rough nature. 274621|0|142|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2061|He said, in reply, that he had not spoken until the very last possible moment, that he could exist no longer without sustenance of some kind, and that therefore in another day his suggestion would be too late, as regarded himself at least. 274900|1|142|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2062|Finding that he was not to be moved by anything I could say in a mild tone, I now assumed a different demeanor, and told him that he must be aware I had suffered less than any of us from our calamities; that my health and strength, consequently, were at that moment far better than his own, or than that either of Peters or Augustus; in short, that I was in a condition to have my own way by force if I found it necessary; and that if he attempted in any manner to acquaint the others with his bloody and cannibal designs, I would not hesitate to throw him into the sea. 275139|0|143|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2063|Upon this he immediately seized me by the throat, and drawing a knife, made several ineffectual efforts to stab me in the stomach; an atrocity which his excessive debility alone prevented him from accomplishing. 275709|1|143|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2064|In the meantime, being roused to a high pitch of anger, I forced him to the vessel's side, with the full intention of throwing him overboard. 275920|2|143|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2065|He was saved from his fate, however, by the interference of Peters, who now approached and separated us, asking the cause of the disturbance. 276061|3|143|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2066|This Parker told before I could find means in any manner to prevent him. 276202|4|143|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2067|The effect of his words was even more terrible than what I had anticipated. 276274|0|144|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2068|Both Augustus and Peters, who, it seems, had long secretly entertained the same fearful idea which Parker had been merely the first to broach, joined with him in his design and insisted upon its immediately being carried into effect. 276349|1|144|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2069|I had calculated that one at least of the two former would be found still possessed of sufficient strength of mind to side with myself in resisting any attempt to execute so dreadful a purpose, and, with the aid of either one of them, I had no fear of being able to prevent its accomplishment. 276582|2|144|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2070|Being disappointed in this expectation, it became absolutely necessary that I should attend to my own safety, as a further resistance on my part might possibly be considered by men in their frightful condition a sufficient excuse for refusing me fair play in the tragedy that I knew would speedily be enacted. 276875|3|144|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2071|I now told them I was willing to submit to the proposal, merely requesting a delay of about one hour, in order that the fog which had gathered around us might have an opportunity of lifting, when it was possible that the ship we had seen might be again in sight. 277184|0|145|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2072|After great difficulty I obtained from them a promise to wait thus long; and, as I had anticipated (a breeze rapidly coming in), the fog lifted before the hour had expired, when, no vessel appearing in sight, we prepared to draw lots. 277446|1|145|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2073|It is with extreme reluctance that I dwell upon the appalling scene which ensued; a scene which, with its minutest details, no after events have been able to efface in the slightest degree from my memory, and whose stern recollection will embitter every future moment of my existence. 277680|0|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2074|Let me run over this portion of my narrative with as much haste as the nature of the events to be spoken of will permit. 277964|1|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2075|I thought of falling on my knees to my companions, and entreating them to let me escape this necessity; of suddenly rushing upon them, and, by putting one of them to death, of rendering the decision by lot useless–in short, of every thing but of going through with the matter I had in hand. 278084|10|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2076|At last, after wasting a long time in this imbecile conduct, I was recalled to my senses by the voice of Parker, who urged me to relieve them at once from the terrible anxiety they were enduring. 278374|11|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2077|Even then I could not bring myself to arrange the splinters upon the spot, but thought over every species of finesse by which I could trick some one of my fellow-sufferers to draw the short straw, as it had been agreed that whoever drew the shortest of four splinters from my hand was to die for the preservation of the rest. 278569|12|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2078|Before any one condemn me for this apparent heartlessness, let him be placed in a situation precisely similar to my own. 278894|13|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2079|The only method we could devise for the terrific lottery, in which we were to take each a chance, was that of drawing straws. 279014|2|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2080|Small splinters of wood were made to answer our purpose, and it was agreed that I should be the holder. 279139|3|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2081|I retired to one end of the hulk, while my poor companions silently took up their station in the other with their backs turned toward me. 279242|4|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2082|The bitterest anxiety which I endured at any period of this fearful drama was while I occupied myself in the arrangement of the lots. 279379|5|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2083|There are few conditions into which man can possibly fall where he will not feel a deep interest in the preservation of his existence; an interest momentarily increasing with the frailness of the tenure by which that existence may be held. 279512|6|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2084|But now that the silent, definite, and stern nature of the business in which I was engaged (so different from the tumultuous dangers of the storm or the gradually approaching horrors of famine) allowed me to reflect on the few chances I had of escaping the most appalling of deaths–a death for the most appalling of purposes–every particle of that energy which had so long buoyed me up departed like feathers before the wind, leaving me a helpless prey to the most abject and pitiable terror. 279751|7|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2085|I could not, at first, even summon up sufficient strength to tear and fit together the small splinters of wood, my fingers absolutely refusing their office, and my knees knocking violently against each other. 280243|8|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2086|My mind ran over rapidly a thousand absurd projects by which to avoid becoming a partner in the awful speculation. 280451|9|146|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2087|At length delay was no longer possible, and, with a heart almost bursting from my bosom, I advanced to the region of the forecastle, where my companions were awaiting me. 280565|0|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2088|I held out my hand with the splinters, and Peters immediately drew. 280735|1|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2089|No one spoke, and still I dared not satisfy myself by looking at the splinter I held. 280802|10|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2090|Peters at length took me by the hand, and I forced myself to look up, when I immediately saw by the countenance of Parker that I was safe, and that he it was who had been doomed to suffer. 280887|11|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2091|Gasping for breath, I fell senseless to the deck. 281075|12|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2092|He was free–his, at least, was not the shortest; and there was now another chance against my escape. 281124|2|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2093|I summoned up all my strength, and passed the lots to Augustus. 281224|3|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2094|He also drew immediately, and he also was free; and now, whether I should live or die, the chances were no more than precisely even. 281287|4|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2095|At this moment all the fierceness of the tiger possessed my bosom, and I felt toward my poor fellow-creature, Parker, the most intense, the most diabolical hatred. 281419|5|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2096|But the feeling did not last; and, at length, with a convulsive shudder and closed eyes, I held out the two remaining splinters toward him. 281582|6|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2097|It was fully five minutes before he could summon resolution to draw, during which period of heartrending suspense I never once opened my eyes. 281721|7|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2098|Presently one of the two lots was quickly drawn from my hand. 281863|8|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2099|The decision was then over, yet I knew not whether it was for me or against me. 281924|9|147|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2100|I recovered from my swoon in time to behold the consummation of the tragedy in the death of him who had been chiefly instrumental in bringing it about. 282003|0|148|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2101|He made no resistance whatever, and was stabbed in the back by Peters, when he fell instantly dead. 282154|1|148|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2102|I must not dwell upon the fearful repast which immediately ensued. 282253|2|148|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2103|Such things may be imagined, but words have no power to impress the mind with the exquisite horror of their reality. 282319|3|148|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2104|Let it suffice to say that, having in some measure appeased the raging thirst which consumed us by the blood of the victim, and having by common consent taken off the hands, feet, and head, throwing them together with the entrails, into the sea, we devoured the rest of the body, piecemeal, during the four ever memorable days of the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth of the month. 282435|4|148|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2105|On the nineteenth, there coming on a smart shower which lasted fifteen or twenty minutes, we contrived to catch some water by means of a sheet which had been fished up from the cabin by our drag just after the gale. 282833|0|149|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2106|The quantity we took in all did not amount to more than half a gallon; but even this scanty allowance supplied us with comparative strength and hope. 283048|1|149|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2107|After searching in vain for about the period of time just mentioned, it was determined to get back to the ship. 283197|0|15|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2108|They had scarcely made this resolve when a feeble cry arose from a dark object that floated rapidly by. 283308|1|15|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2109|They pursued and soon overtook it. 283411|2|15|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2110|It proved to be the entire deck of the Ariel's cuddy. 283445|3|15|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2111|Augustus was struggling near it, apparently in the last agonies. 283498|4|15|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2112|Upon getting hold of him it was found that he was attached by a rope to the floating timber. 283562|5|15|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2113|This rope, it will be remembered, I had myself tied around his waist, and made fast to a ringbolt, for the purpose of keeping him in an upright position, and my so doing, it appeared, had been ultimately the means of preserving his life. 283654|6|15|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2114|The Ariel was slightly put together, and in going down her frame naturally went to pieces; the deck of the cuddy, as might have been expected, was lifted, by the force of the water rushing in, entirely from the main timbers, and floated (with other fragments, no doubt) to the surface–Augustus was buoyed up with it, and thus escaped a terrible death. 283891|7|15|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2115|On the twenty-first we were again reduced to the last necessity. 284242|0|150|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2116|On the twenty-second, as we were sitting close huddled together, gloomily revolving over our lamentable condition, there flashed through my mind all at once an idea which inspired me with a bright gleam of hope. 284306|0|151|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2117|I remembered that, when the foremast had been cut away, Peters, being in the windward chains, passed one of the axes into my hand, requesting me to put it, if possible, in a place of security, and that a few minutes before the last heavy sea struck the brig and filled her I had taken this axe into the forecastle and laid it in one of the larboard berths. 284517|1|151|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2118|I now thought it possible that, by getting at this axe, we might cut through the deck over the storeroom, and thus readily supply ourselves with provisions. 284873|2|151|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2119|When I communicated this object to my companions, they uttered a feeble shout of joy, and we all proceeded forthwith to the forecastle. 285029|0|152|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2120|The difficulty of descending here was greater than that of going down in the cabin, the opening being much smaller, for it will be remembered that the whole framework about the cabin companion-hatch had been carried away, whereas the forecastle-way, being a simple hatch of only about three feet square, had remained uninjured. 285164|1|152|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2121|I did not hesitate, however, to attempt the descent; and a rope being fastened round my body as before, I plunged boldly in, feet foremost, made my way quickly to the berth, and at the first attempt brought up the axe. 285491|2|152|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2122|It was hailed with the most ecstatic joy and triumph, and the ease with which it had been obtained was regarded as an omen of our ultimate preservation. 285709|3|152|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2123|We now commenced cutting at the deck with all the energy of rekindled hope, Peters and myself taking the axe by turns, Augustus's wounded arm not permitting him to aid us in any degree. 285861|0|153|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2124|As we were still so feeble as to be scarcely able to stand unsupported, and could consequently work but a minute or two without resting, it soon became evident that many long hours would be necessary to accomplish our task–that is, to cut an opening sufficiently large to admit of a free access to the storeroom. 286046|1|153|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2125|This consideration, however, did not discourage us; and, working all night by the light of the moon, we succeeded in effecting our purpose by daybreak on the morning of the twenty-third. 286358|2|153|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2126|Peters now volunteered to go down; and, having made all arrangements as before, he descended, and soon returned bringing up with him a small jar, which, to our great joy, proved to be full of olives. 286544|0|154|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2127|Having shared these among us, and devoured them with the greatest avidity, we proceeded to let him down again. 286743|1|154|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2128|This time he succeeded beyond our utmost expectations, returning instantly with a large ham and a bottle of Madeira wine. 286853|2|154|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2129|Of the latter we each took a moderate sup, having learned by experience the pernicious consequences of indulging too freely. 286974|3|154|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2130|The ham, except about two pounds near the bone, was not in a condition to be eaten, having been entirely spoiled by the salt water. 287098|4|154|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2131|The sound part was divided among us. 287229|5|154|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2132|Peters and Augustus, not being able to restrain their appetite, swallowed theirs upon the instant; but I was more cautious, and ate but a small portion of mine, dreading the thirst which I knew would ensue. 287265|6|154|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2133|We now rested a while from our labors, which had been intolerably severe. 287471|7|154|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2134|By noon, feeling somewhat strengthened and refreshed, we again renewed our attempt at getting up provisions, Peters and myself going down alternately, and always with more or less success, until sundown. 287544|0|155|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2135|During this interval we had the good fortune to bring up, altogether, four more small jars of olives, another ham, a carboy containing nearly three gallons of excellent Cape Madeira wine, and, what gave us still more delight, a small tortoise of the Gallipago breed, several of which had been taken on board by Captain Barnard, as the Grampus was leaving port, from the schooner Mary Pitts, just returned from a sealing voyage in the Pacific. 287747|1|155|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2136|In a subsequent portion of this narrative I shall have frequent occasion to mention this species of tortoise. 288189|0|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2137|It is found principally, as most of my readers may know, in the group of islands called the Gallipagos, which, indeed, derive their name from the animal–the Spanish word Gallipago meaning a fresh-water terrapin. 288298|1|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2138|In one particular these extraordinary animals bear a resemblance to the dromedary, or camel of the desert. 288509|10|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2139|In a bag at the root of the neck they carry with them a constant supply of water. 288615|11|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2140|In some instances, upon killing them after a full year's deprivation of all nourishment, as much as three gallons of perfectly sweet and fresh water have been found in their bags. 288696|12|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2141|Their food is chiefly wild parsley and celery, with purslain, sea-kelp, and prickly pears, upon which latter vegetable they thrive wonderfully, a great quantity of it being usually found on the hillsides near the shore wherever the animal itself is discovered. 288875|13|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2142|They are excellent and highly nutritious food, and have, no doubt, been the means of preserving the lives of thousands of seamen employed in the whale-fishery and other pursuits in the Pacific. 289135|14|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2143|From the peculiarity of their shape and action they have been sometimes called the elephant tortoise. 289328|2|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2144|They are frequently found of an enormous size. 289429|3|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2145|I have myself seen several which would weigh from twelve to fifteen hundred pounds, although I do not remember that any navigator speaks of having seen them weighing more than eight hundred. 289475|4|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2146|Their appearance is singular, and even disgusting. 289665|5|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2147|Their steps are very slow, measured, and heavy, their bodies being carried about a foot from the ground. 289715|6|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2148|Their neck is long, and exceedingly slender, from eighteen inches to two feet is a very common length, and I killed one, where the distance from the shoulder to the extremity of the head was no less than three feet ten inches. 289819|7|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2149|The head has a striking resemblance to that of a serpent. 290045|8|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2150|They can exist without food for an almost incredible length of time, instances having been known where they have been thrown into the hold of a vessel and lain two years without nourishment of any kind–being as fat, and, in every respect, in as good order at the expiration of the time as when they were first put in. 290102|9|156|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2151|The one which we had the good fortune to bring up from the storeroom was not of a large size, weighing probably sixty-five or seventy pounds. 290419|0|157|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2152|It was a female, and in excellent condition, being exceedingly fat, and having more than a quart of limpid and sweet water in its bag. 290560|1|157|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2153|This was indeed a treasure; and, falling on our knees with one accord, we returned fervent thanks to God for so seasonable a relief. 290694|2|157|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2154|We had great difficulty in getting the animal up through the opening, as its struggles were fierce and its strength prodigious. 290826|0|158|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2155|It was upon the point of making its escape from Peter's grasp, and slipping back into the water, when Augustus, throwing a rope with a slipknot around its throat, held it up in this manner until I jumped into the hole by the side of Peters, and assisted him in lifting it out. 290953|1|158|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2156|The water we drew carefully from the bag into the jug; which, it will be remembered, had been brought up before from the cabin. 291229|0|159|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2157|Having done this, we broke off the neck of a bottle so as to form, with the cork, a kind of glass, holding not quite half a gill. 291356|1|159|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2158|We then each drank one of these measures full, and resolved to limit ourselves to this quantity per day as long as it should hold out. 291485|2|159|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2159|It was more than an hour after being taken on board the Penguin before he could give any account of himself, or be made to comprehend the nature of the accident which had befAllan our boat. 291619|0|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2160|At length he became thoroughly aroused, and spoke much of his sensations while in the water. 291808|1|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2161|During the whole period of his struggles he had not the faintest recollection of the Ariel, nor of the matters in connexion with the source of his disaster. 291900|10|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2162|A vague feeling of terror and despair had taken entire possession of his faculties. 292056|11|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2163|When he was finally picked up, every power of his mind had failed him; and, as before said, it was nearly an hour after getting on board the Penguin before he became fully aware of his condition. 292139|12|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2164|In regard to myself–I was resuscitated from a state bordering very nearly upon death (and after every other means had been tried in vain for three hours and a half) by vigorous friction with flannels bathed in hot oil–a proceeding suggested by Augustus. 292334|13|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2165|The wound in my neck, although of an ugly appearance, proved of little real consequence, and I soon recovered from its effects. 292587|14|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2166|Upon his first attaining any degree of consciousness, he found himself beneath the surface, whirling round and round with inconceivable rapidity, and with a rope wrapped in three or four folds tightly about his neck. 292714|2|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2167|In an instant afterward he felt himself going rapidly upward, when, his head striking violently against a hard substance, he again relapsed into insensibility. 292930|3|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2168|Upon once more reviving he was in fuller possession of his reason–this was still, however, in the greatest degree clouded and confused. 293089|4|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2169|He now knew that some accident had occurred, and that he was in the water, although his mouth was above the surface, and he could breathe with some freedom. 293224|5|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2170|Possibly, at this period the deck was drifting rapidly before the wind, and drawing him after it, as he floated upon his back. 293380|6|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2171|Of course, as long as he could have retained this position, it would have been nearly impossible that he should be drowned. 293506|7|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2172|Presently a surge threw him directly athwart the deck, and this post he endeavored to maintain, screaming at intervals for help. 293629|8|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2173|just before he was discovered by Mr. Henderson, he had been obliged to relax his hold through exhaustion, and, falling into the sea, had given himself up for lost. 293757|9|16|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2174|During the last two or three days, the weather having been dry and pleasant, the bedding we had obtained from the cabin, as well as our clothing, had become thoroughly dry, so that we passed this night (that of the twenty-third) in comparative comfort, enjoying a tranquil repose, after having supped plentifully on olives and ham, with a small allowance of the wine. 293920|0|160|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2175|Being afraid of losing some of our stores overboard during the night, in the event of a breeze springing up, we secured them as well as possible with cordage to the fragments of the windlass. 294287|1|160|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2176|Our tortoise, which we were anxious to preserve alive as long as we could, we threw on its back, and otherwise carefully fastened. 294478|2|160|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2178|–This morning saw us wonderfully recruited in spirits and strength. 294616|1|161|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2179|Notwithstanding the perilous situation in which we were still placed, ignorant of our position, although certainly at a great distance from land, without more food than would last us for a fortnight even with great care, almost entirely without water, and floating about at the mercy of every wind and wave on the merest wreck in the world, still the infinitely more terrible distresses and dangers from which we had so lately and so providentially been delivered caused us to regard what we now endured as but little more than an ordinary evil–so strictly comparative is either good or ill. 294683|2|161|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2180|At sunrise we were preparing to renew our attempts at getting up something from the storeroom, when, a smart shower coming on, with some lightning, we turn our attention to the catching of water by means of the sheet we had used before for this purpose. 295274|0|162|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2181|We had no other means of collecting the rain than by holding the sheet spread out with one of the forechain-plates in the middle of it. 295527|1|162|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2182|The water, thus conducted to the centre, was drained through into our jug. 295662|2|162|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2183|We had nearly filled it in this manner, when, a heavy squall coming on from the northward, obliged us to desist, as the hulk began once more to roll so violently that we could no longer keep our feet. 295736|3|162|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2184|We now went forward, and, lashing ourselves securely to the remnant of the windlass as before, awaited the event with far more calmness than could have been anticipated or would have been imagined possible under the circumstances. 295936|4|162|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2185|At noon the wind had freshened into a two-reef breeze, and by night into a stiff gale, accompanied with a tremendously heavy swell. 296166|5|162|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2186|Experience having taught us, however, the best method of arranging our lashings, we weathered this dreary night in tolerable security, although thoroughly drenched at almost every instant by the sea, and in momentary dread of being washed off. 296297|6|162|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2187|Fortunately, the weather was so warm as to render the water rather grateful than otherwise. 296540|7|162|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2189|–This morning the gale had diminished to a mere ten-knot breeze, and the sea had gone down with it so considerably that we were able to keep ourselves dry upon the deck. 296639|1|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2190|At one time, a lurch throwing the deck very far beneath the water, the monster actually swam in upon us, floundering for some moments just over the companion-hatch, and striking Peters violently with his tail. 296808|10|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2191|A heavy sea at length hurled him overboard, much to our relief. 297017|11|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2192|In moderate weather we might have easily captured him. 297080|12|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2193|To our great grief, however, we found that two jars of our olives, as well as the whole of our ham, had been washed overboard, in spite of the careful manner in which they had been fastened. 297134|2|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2194|We determined not to kill the tortoise as yet, and contented ourselves for the present with a breakfast on a few of the olives, and a measure of water each, which latter we mixed half and half, with wine, finding great relief and strength from the mixture, without the distressing intoxication which had ensued upon drinking the port. 297324|3|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2195|The sea was still far too rough for the renewal of our efforts at getting up provision from the storeroom. 297658|4|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2196|Several articles, of no importance to us in our present situation, floated up through the opening during the day, and were immediately washed overboard. 297764|5|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2197|We also now observed that the hulk lay more along than ever, so that we could not stand an instant without lashing ourselves. 297916|6|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2198|On this account we passed a gloomy and uncomfortable day. 298041|7|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2199|At noon the sun appeared to be nearly vertical, and we had no doubt that we had been driven down by the long succession of northward and northwesterly winds into the near vicinity of the equator. 298098|8|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2200|Toward evening saw several sharks, and were somewhat alarmed by the audacious manner in which an enormously large one approached us. 298293|9|163|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2203|After a great deal of hard labor during the whole day, we found that nothing further was to be expected from this quarter, the partitions of the room having been stove during the night, and its contents swept into the hold. 298568|2|164|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2204|This discovery, as may be supposed, filled us with despair. 298791|3|164|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2207|The sun coming out hotly in the afternoon, we occupied ourselves in drying our clothes. 298943|2|165|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2208|Found great relief from thirst, and much comfort otherwise, by bathing in the sea; in this, however, we were forced to use great caution, being afraid of sharks, several of which were seen swimming around the brig during the day. 299030|3|165|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2211|The brig now began to lie along so alarmingly that we feared she would eventually roll bottom up. 299287|2|166|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2212|Prepared ourselves as well as we could for this emergency, lashing our tortoise, waterjug, and two remaining jars of olives as far as possible over to the windward, placing them outside the hull below the main-chains. 299384|3|166|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2216|Augustus's wounded arm began to evince symptoms of mortification. 299696|2|167|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2217|He complained of drowsiness and excessive thirst, but no acute pain. 299761|3|167|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2218|Nothing could be done for his relief beyond rubbing his wounds with a little of the vinegar from the olives, and from this no benefit seemed to be experienced. 299829|4|167|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2229|–After a night of excessive anxiety and fatigue, owing to the position of the hulk, we set about killing and cutting up our tortoise. 300673|1|169|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2230|He proved to be much smaller than we had supposed, although in good condition,–the whole meat about him not amounting to more than ten pounds. 300806|2|169|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2231|With a view of preserving a portion of this as long as possible, we cut it into fine pieces, and filled with them our three remaining olive jars and the wine-bottle (all of which had been kept), pouring in afterward the vinegar from the olives. 300948|3|169|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2232|In this manner we put away about three pounds of the tortoise, intending not to touch it until we had consumed the rest. 301192|4|169|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2233|We concluded to restrict ourselves to about four ounces of the meat per day; the whole would thus last us thirteen days. 301312|5|169|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2234|A brisk shower, with severe thunder and lightning, came on about dusk, but lasted so short a time that we only succeeded in catching about half a pint of water. 301432|6|169|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2235|The whole of this, by common consent, was given to Augustus, who now appeared to be in the last extremity. 301592|7|169|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2236|He drank the water from the sheet as we caught it (we holding it above him as he lay so as to let it run into his mouth), for we had now nothing left capable of holding water, unless we had chosen to empty out our wine from the carboy, or the stale water from the jug. 301698|8|169|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2240|I suppose all at the table were too much fatigued themselves to notice our jaded appearance–of course, it would not have borne a very rigid scrutiny. 302327|2|17|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2241|Schoolboys, however, can accomplish wonders in the way of deception, and I verily believe not one of our friends in Nantucket had the slightest suspicion that the terrible story told by some sailors in town of their having run down a vessel at sea and drowned some thirty or forty poor devils, had reference either to the Ariel, my companion, or myself. 302476|3|17|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2242|We two have since very frequently talked the matter over–but never without a shudder. 302829|4|17|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2243|In one of our conversations Augustus frankly confessed to me, that in his whole life he had at no time experienced so excruciating a sense of dismay, as when on board our little boat he first discovered the extent of his intoxication, and felt himself sinking beneath its influence. 302914|5|17|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2247|He was frightfully emaciated; so much so that, although he weighed a hundred and twenty-seven pounds upon his leaving Nantucket, he now did not weigh more than forty or fifty at the farthest. 303403|3|170|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2248|His eyes were sunk far in his head, being scarcely perceptible, and the skin of his cheeks hung so loosely as to prevent his masticating any food, or even swallowing any liquid, without great difficulty. 303594|4|170|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2250|–A continuance of the same calm weather, with an oppressively hot sun. 303806|1|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2251|It was then loathsome beyond expression, and so far decayed that, as Peters attempted to lift it, an entire leg came off in his grasp. 303876|10|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2252|As the mass of putrefaction slipped over the vessel's side into the water, the glare of phosphoric light with which it was surrounded plainly discovered to us seven or eight large sharks, the clashing of whose horrible teeth, as their prey was torn to pieces among them, might have been heard at the distance of a mile. 304010|11|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2253|We shrunk within ourselves in the extremity of horror at the sound. 304329|12|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2254|Suffered exceedingly from thirst, the water in the jug being absolutely putrid and swarming with vermin. 304396|2|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2255|We contrived, nevertheless, to swallow a portion of it by mixing it with wine; our thirst, however, was but little abated. 304500|3|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2256|We found more relief by bathing in the sea, but could not avail ourselves of this expedient except at long intervals, on account of the continual presence of sharks. 304622|4|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2257|We now saw clearly that Augustus could not be saved; that he was evidently dying. 304787|5|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2258|We could do nothing to relieve his sufferings, which appeared to be great. 304868|6|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2259|About twelve o'clock he expired in strong convulsions, and without having spoken for several days. 304942|7|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2260|His death filled us with the most gloomy forebodings, and had so great an effect upon our spirits that we sat motionless by the corpse during the whole day, and never addressed each other except in a whisper. 305040|8|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2261|It was not until some time after dark that we took courage to get up and throw the body overboard. 305248|9|171|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2263|–The same fearfully calm and hot weather. 305355|1|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2264|Nor, indeed, were we altogether free from the apprehension of immediate danger, for the least slip or false movement would have thrown us at once within reach of those voracious fish, who frequently thrust themselves directly upon us, swimming up to leeward. 305396|10|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2265|No shouts or exertions on our part seemed to alarm them. 305654|11|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2266|Even when one of the largest was struck with an axe by Peters and much wounded, he persisted in his attempts to push in where we were. 305710|12|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2267|A cloud came up at dusk, but, to our extreme anguish, passed over without discharging itself. 305844|13|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2268|It is quite impossible to conceive our sufferings from thirst at this period. 305937|14|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2269|We passed a sleepless night, both on this account and through dread of the sharks. 306014|15|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2270|The dawn found us in a state of pitiable dejection as well as bodily exhaustion. 306096|2|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2271|The water in the jug was now absolutely useless, being a thick gelatinous mass; nothing but frightful-looking worms mingled with slime. 306176|3|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2272|We threw it out, and washed the jug well in the sea, afterward pouring a little vinegar in it from our bottles of pickled tortoise. 306311|4|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2273|Our thirst could now scarcely be endured, and we tried in vain to relieve it by wine, which seemed only to add fuel to the flame, and excited us to a high degree of intoxication. 306442|5|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2274|We afterward endeavoured to relieve our sufferings by mixing the wine with seawater; but this instantly brought about the most violent retchings, so that we never again attempted it. 306620|6|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2275|During the whole day we anxiously sought an opportunity of bathing, but to no purpose; for the hulk was now entirely besieged on all sides with sharks–no doubt the identical monsters who had devoured our poor companion on the evening before, and who were in momentary expectation of another similar feast. 306802|7|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2276|This circumstance occasioned us the most bitter regret and filled us with the most depressing and melancholy forebodings. 307107|8|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2277|We had experienced indescribable relief in bathing, and to have this resource cut off in so frightful a manner was more than we could bear. 307228|9|172|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2278|August 3. 307367|0|173|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2279|–No prospect of relief, and the brig lying still more and more along, so that now we could not maintain a footing upon deck at all. 307376|1|173|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2280|Busied ourselves in securing our wine and tortoise-meat, so that we might not lose them in the event of our rolling over. 307507|2|173|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2281|Got out two stout spikes from the forechains, and, by means of the axe, drove them into the hull to windward within a couple of feet of the water, this not being very far from the keel, as we were nearly upon our beam-ends. 307628|3|173|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2282|To these spikes we now lashed our provisions, as being more secure than their former position beneath the chains. 307851|4|173|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2283|Suffered great agony from thirst during the whole day–no chance of bathing on account of the sharks, which never left us for a moment. 307964|5|173|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2284|Found it impossible to sleep. 308098|6|173|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2285|August 4. 308127|0|174|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2286|–A little before daybreak we perceived that the hulk was heeling over, and aroused ourselves to prevent being thrown off by the movement. 308136|1|174|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2287|At first the roll was slow and gradual, and we contrived to clamber over to windward very well, having taken the precaution to leave ropes hanging from the spikes we had driven in for the provision. 308273|2|174|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2288|But we had not calculated sufficiently upon the acceleration of the impetus; for, presently the heel became too violent to allow of our keeping pace with it; and, before either of us knew what was to happen, we found ourselves hurled furiously into the sea, and struggling several fathoms beneath the surface, with the huge hull immediately above us. 308471|3|174|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2289|In going under the water I had been obliged to let go my hold upon the rope; and finding that I was completely beneath the vessel, and my strength nearly exhausted, I scarcely made a struggle for life, and resigned myself, in a few seconds, to die. 308821|0|175|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2290|But here again I was deceived, not having taken into consideration the natural rebound of the hull to windward. 309069|1|175|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2291|The whirl of the water upward, which the vessel occasioned in Tolling partially back, brought me to the surface still more violently than I had been plunged beneath. 309180|2|175|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2292|Upon coming up I found myself about twenty yards from the hulk, as near as I could judge. 309345|3|175|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2293|She was lying keel up, rocking furiously from side to side, and the sea in all directions around was much agitated, and full of strong whirlpools. 309434|4|175|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2294|I could see nothing of Peters. 309580|5|175|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2295|An oil-cask was floating within a few feet of me, and various other articles from the brig were scattered about. 309610|6|175|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2296|My principal terror was now on account of the sharks, which I knew to be in my vicinity. 309722|0|176|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2297|In order to deter these, if possible, from approaching me, I splashed the water vigorously with both hands and feet as I swam towards the hulk, creating a body of foam. 309810|1|176|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2298|I have no doubt that to this expedient, simple as it was, I was indebted for my preservation; for the sea all round the brig, just before her rolling over, was so crowded with these monsters, that I must have been, and really was, in actual contact with some of them during my progress. 309978|2|176|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2299|By great good fortune, however, I reached the side of the vessel in safety, although so utterly weakened by the violent exertion I had used that I should never have been able to get upon it but for the timely assistance of Peters, who, now, to my great joy, made his appearance (having scrambled up to the keel from the opposite side of the hull), and threw me the end of a rope–one of those which had been attached to the spikes. 310264|3|176|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2300|Having barely escaped this danger, our attention was now directed to the dreadful imminency of another–that of absolute starvation. 310694|0|177|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2301|Our whole stock of provision had been swept overboard in spite of all our care in securing it; and seeing no longer the remotest possibility of obtaining more, we gave way both of us to despair, weeping aloud like children, and neither of us attempting to offer consolation to the other. 310825|1|177|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2302|Such weakness can scarcely be conceived, and to those who have never been similarly situated will, no doubt, appear unnatural; but it must be remembered that our intellects were so entirely disordered by the long course of privation and terror to which we had been subjected, that we could not justly be considered, at that period, in the light of rational beings. 311112|2|177|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2303|In subsequent perils, nearly as great, if not greater, I bore up with fortitude against all the evils of my situation, and Peters, it will be seen, evinced a stoical philosophy nearly as incredible as his present childlike supineness and imbecility–the mental condition made the difference. 311476|3|177|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2304|The overturning of the brig, even with the consequent loss of the wine and turtle, would not, in fact, have rendered our situation more deplorable than before, except for the disappearance of the bedclothes by which we had been hitherto enabled to catch rainwater, and of the jug in which we had kept it when caught; for we found the whole bottom, from within two or three feet of the bends as far as the keel, together with the keel itself, thickly covered with large barnacles, which proved to be excellent and highly nutritious food. 311766|0|178|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2305|Thus, in two important respects, the accident we had so greatly dreaded proved to be a benefit rather than an injury; it had opened to us a supply of provisions which we could not have exhausted, using it moderately, in a month; and it had greatly contributed to our comfort as regards position, we being much more at ease, and in infinitely less danger, than before. 312302|1|178|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2306|The difficulty, however, of now obtaining water blinded us to all the benefits of the change in our condition. 312669|0|179|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2307|That we might be ready to avail ourselves, as far as possible, of any shower which might fall we took off our shirts, to make use of them as we had of the sheets–not hoping, of course, to get more in this way, even under the most favorable circumstances, than half a gill at a time. 312779|1|179|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2308|No signs of a cloud appeared during the day, and the agonies of our thirst were nearly intolerable. 313061|2|179|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2309|At night, Peters obtained about an hour's disturbed sleep, but my intense sufferings would not permit me to close my eyes for a single moment. 313160|3|179|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2310|In no affairs of mere prejudice, pro or con, do we deduce inferences with entire certainty, even from the most simple data. 313302|0|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2311|It might be supposed that a catastrophe such as I have just related would have effectually cooled my incipient passion for the sea. 313425|1|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2312|Augustus thoroughly entered into my state of mind. 313556|10|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2313|It is probable, indeed, that our intimate communion had resulted in a partial interchange of character. 313606|11|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2314|On the contrary, I never experienced a more ardent longing for the wild adventures incident to the life of a navigator than within a week after our miraculous deliverance. 313709|2|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2315|This short period proved amply long enough to erase from my memory the shadows, and bring out in vivid light all the pleasurably exciting points of color, all the picturesqueness, of the late perilous accident. 313880|3|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2316|My conversations with Augustus grew daily more frequent and more intensely full of interest. 314090|4|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2317|He had a manner of relating his stories of the ocean (more than one half of which I now suspect to have been sheer fabrications) well adapted to have weight with one of my enthusiastic temperament and somewhat gloomy although glowing imagination. 314182|5|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2318|It is strange, too, that he most strongly enlisted my feelings in behalf of the life of a seaman, when he depicted his more terrible moments of suffering and despair. 314428|6|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2319|For the bright side of the painting I had a limited sympathy. 314594|7|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2320|My visions were of shipwreck and famine; of death or captivity among barbarian hordes; of a lifetime dragged out in sorrow and tears, upon some gray and desolate rock, in an ocean unapproachable and unknown. 314655|8|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2321|Such visions or desires–for they amounted to desires–are common, I have since been assured, to the whole numerous race of the melancholy among men–at the time of which I speak I regarded them only as prophetic glimpses of a destiny which I felt myself in a measure bound to fulfil. 314862|9|18|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2323|–To-day, a gentle breeze springing up carried us through a vast quantity of seaweed, among which we were so fortunate as to find eleven small crabs, which afforded us several delicious meals. 315152|1|180|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2324|Their shells being quite soft, we ate them entire, and found that they irritated our thirst far less than the barnacles. 315343|2|180|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2325|Seeing no trace of sharks among the seaweed, we also ventured to bathe, and remained in the water for four or five hours, during which we experienced a very sensible diminution of our thirst. 315463|3|180|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2326|Were greatly refreshed, and spent the night somewhat more comfortably than before, both of us snatching a little sleep. 315654|4|180|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2329|Bitterly did we now regret the loss of our jug and carboy; for, in spite of the little means we had of catching the water, we might have filled one, if not both of them. 315880|2|181|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2330|As it was, we contrived to satisfy the cravings of thirst by suffering the shirts to become saturated, and then wringing them so as to let the grateful fluid trickle into our mouths. 316049|3|181|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2331|In this occupation we passed the entire day. 316231|4|181|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2333|–Just at daybreak we both at the same instant descried a sail to the eastward, and evidently coming towards us! 316284|1|182|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2334|We hailed the glorious sight with a long, although feeble shout of rapture; and began instantly to make every signal in our power, by flaring the shirts in the air, leaping as high as our weak condition would permit, and even by hallooing with all the strength of our lungs, although the vessel could not have been less than fifteen miles distant. 316395|2|182|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2335|However, she still continued to near our hulk, and we felt that, if she but held her present course, she must eventually come so close as to perceive us. 316742|3|182|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2336|In about an hour after we first discovered her, we could clearly see the people on her decks. 316895|4|182|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2337|She was a long, low, and rakish-looking topsail schooner, with a black ball in her foretopsail, and had, apparently, a full crew. 316988|5|182|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2338|We now became alarmed, for we could hardly imagine it possible that she did not observe us, and were apprehensive that she meant to leave us to perish as we were–an act of fiendish barbarity, which, however incredible it may appear, has been repeatedly perpetuated at sea, under circumstances very nearly similar, and by beings who were regarded as belonging to the human species. 317117|6|182|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2339|* In this instance, however, by the mercy of God, we were destined to be most happily deceived; for, presently we were aware of a sudden commotion on the deck of the stranger, who immediately afterward ran up a British flag, and, hauling her wind, bore up directly upon us. 317497|7|182|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2340|In half an hour more we found ourselves in her cabin. 317770|8|182|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2341|She proved to be the Jane Guy, of Liverpool, Captain Guy, bound on a sealing and trading voyage to the South Seas and Pacific. 317823|9|182|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2342|* The case of the brig Polly, of Boston, is one so much in point, and her fate, in many respects, so remarkably similar to our own, that I cannot forbear alluding to it here. 317949|0|183|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2343|This vessel, of one hundred and thirty tons burden, sailed from Boston, with a cargo of lumber and provisions, for Santa Croix, on the twelfth of December, 1811, under the command of Captain Casneau. 318123|1|183|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2344|There were eight souls on board besides the captain–the mate, four seamen, and the cook, together with a Mr. Hunt, and a negro girl belonging to him. 318322|2|183|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2345|On the fifteenth, having cleared the shoal of Georges, she sprung a leak in a gale of wind from the southeast, and was finally capsized; but, the masts going by the board, she afterward righted. 318471|3|183|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2346|They remained in this situation, without fire, and with very little provision, for the period of one hundred and ninety-one days (from December the fifteenth to June the twentieth), when Captain Casneau and Samuel Badger, the only survivors, were taken off the wreck by the Fame, of Hull, Captain Featherstone, bound home from Rio Janeiro. 318665|4|183|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2347|When picked up, they were in latitude 28 degrees N., longitude 13 degrees W., having drifted above two thousand miles! 319004|5|183|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2348|On the ninth of July the Fame fell in with the brig Dromero, Captain Perkins, who landed the two sufferers in Kennebeck. 319122|6|183|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2349|"""It is natural to inquire how they could float such a vast distance, upon the most frequented part of the Atlantic, and not be discovered all this time. 319242"|0|184|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2350|"They were passed by more than a dozen sail, one of which came so nigh them that they could distinctly see the people on deck and on the rigging looking at them; but, to the inexpressible disappointment of the starving and freezing men, they stifled the dictates of compassion, hoisted sail, and cruelly abandoned them to their fate"". 319394"|1|184|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2351|The Jane Guy was a fine-looking topsail schooner of a hundred and eighty tons burden. 319727|0|185|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2352|She was unusually sharp in the bows, and on a wind, in moderate weather, the fastest sailer I have ever seen. 319812|1|185|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2353|Her qualities, however, as a rough sea-boat, were not so good, and her draught of water was by far too great for the trade to which she was destined. 319921|2|185|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2354|For this peculiar service, a larger vessel, and one of a light proportionate draught, is desirable–say a vessel of from three hundred to three hundred and fifty tons. 320070|3|185|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2355|She should be bark-rigged, and in other respects of a different construction from the usual South Sea ships. 320236|4|185|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2356|It is absolutely necessary that she should be well armed. 320344|5|185|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2357|She should have, say ten or twelve twelve-pound carronades, and two or three long twelves, with brass blunderbusses, and water-tight arm-chests for each top. 320401|6|185|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2358|Her anchors and cables should be of far greater strength than is required for any other species of trade, and, above all, her crew should be numerous and efficient–not less, for such a vessel as I have described, than fifty or sixty able-bodied men. 320558|7|185|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2359|The Jane Guy had a crew of thirty-five, all able seamen, besides the captain and mate, but she was not altogether as well armed or otherwise equipped, as a navigator acquainted with the difficulties and dangers of the trade could have desired. 320807|8|185|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2360|Captain Guy was a gentleman of great urbanity of manner, and of considerable experience in the southern traffic, to which he had devoted a great portion of his life. 321050|0|186|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2361|He was deficient, however, in energy, and, consequently, in that spirit of enterprise which is here so absolutely requisite. 321215|1|186|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2362|He was part owner of the vessel in which he sailed, and was invested with discretionary powers to cruise in the South Seas for any cargo which might come most readily to hand. 321339|2|186|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2363|He had on board, as usual in such voyages, beads, looking-glasses, tinder-works, axes, hatchets, saws, adzes, planes, chisels, gouges, gimlets, files, spokeshaves, rasps, hammers, nails, knives, scissors, razors, needles, thread, crockery-ware, calico, trinkets, and other similar articles. 321514|3|186|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2364|The schooner sailed from Liverpool on the tenth of July, crossed the Tropic of Cancer on the twenty-fifth, in longitude twenty degrees west, and reached Sal, one of the Cape Verd islands, on the twenty-ninth, where she took in salt and other necessaries for the voyage. 321804|0|187|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2365|On the third of August, she left the Cape Verds and steered southwest, stretching over toward the coast of Brazil, so as to cross the equator between the meridians of twenty-eight and thirty degrees west longitude. 322073|1|187|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2366|This is the course usually taken by vessels bound from Europe to the Cape of Good Hope, or by that route to the East Indies. 322287|2|187|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2367|By proceeding thus they avoid the calms and strong contrary currents which continually prevail on the coast of Guinea, while, in the end, it is found to be the shortest track, as westerly winds are never wanting afterward by which to reach the Cape. 322411|3|187|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2368|It was Captain Guy's intention to make his first stoppage at Kerguelen's Land–I hardly know for what reason. 322660|4|187|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2369|On the day we were picked up the schooner was off Cape St. Roque, in longitude thirty-one degrees west; so that, when found, we had drifted probably, from north to south, not less than five-and-twenty degrees! 322768|5|187|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2370|On board the Jane Guy we were treated with all the kindness our distressed situation demanded. 322977|0|188|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2371|In about a fortnight, during which time we continued steering to the southeast, with gentle breezes and fine weather, both Peters and myself recovered entirely from the effects of our late privation and dreadful sufferings, and we began to remember what had passed rather as a frightful dream from which we had been happily awakened, than as events which had taken place in sober and naked reality. 323071|1|188|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2372|I have since found that this species of partial oblivion is usually brought about by sudden transition, whether from joy to sorrow or from sorrow to joy–the degree of forgetfulness being proportioned to the degree of difference in the exchange. 323469|2|188|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2373|Thus, in my own case, I now feel it impossible to realize the full extent of the misery which I endured during the days spent upon the hulk. 323713|3|188|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2374|The incidents are remembered, but not the feelings which the incidents elicited at the time of their occurrence. 323853|4|188|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2375|I only know, that when they did occur, I then thought human nature could sustain nothing more of agony. 323965|5|188|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2376|We continued our voyage for some weeks without any incidents of greater moment than the occasional meeting with whaling-ships, and more frequently with the black or right whale, so called in contradistinction to the spermaceti. 324068|0|189|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2377|These, however, were chiefly found south of the twenty-fifth parallel. 324295|1|189|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2378|On the sixteenth of September, being in the vicinity of the Cape of Good Hope, the schooner encountered her first gale of any violence since leaving Liverpool. 324365|2|189|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2379|In this neighborhood, but more frequently to the south and east of the promontory (we were to the westward), navigators have often to contend with storms from the northward, which rage with great fury. 324524|3|189|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2380|They always bring with them a heavy sea, and one of their most dangerous features is the instantaneous chopping round of the wind, an occurrence almost certain to take place during the greatest force of the gale. 324725|4|189|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2381|A perfect hurricane will be blowing at one moment from the northward or northeast, and in the next not a breath of wind will be felt in that direction, while from the southwest it will come out all at once with a violence almost inconceivable. 324937|5|189|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2382|A bright spot to the southward is the sure forerunner of the change, and vessels are thus enabled to take the proper precautions. 325180|6|189|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2383|About eighteen months after the period of the Ariel's disaster, the firm of Lloyd and Vredenburgh (a house connected in some manner with the Messieurs Enderby, I believe, of Liverpool) were engaged in repairing and fitting out the brig Grampus for a whaling voyage. 325309|0|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2384|She was an old hulk, and scarcely seaworthy when all was done to her that could be done. 325574|1|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2385|I have since frequently examined my conduct on this occasion with sentiments of displeasure as well as of surprise. 325662|10|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2386|The intense hypocrisy I made use of for the furtherance of my project–an hypocrisy pervading every word and action of my life for so long a period of time–could only have been rendered tolerable to myself by the wild and burning expectation with which I looked forward to the fulfilment of my long-cherished visions of travel. 325777|11|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2387|I hardly know why she was chosen in preference to other good vessels belonging to the same owners–but so it was. 326103|2|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2388|Mr. Barnard was appointed to command her, and Augustus was going with him. 326215|3|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2389|While the brig was getting ready, he frequently urged upon me the excellency of the opportunity now offered for indulging my desire of travel. 326289|4|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2390|He found me by no means an unwilling listener–yet the matter could not be so easily arranged. 326431|5|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2391|My father made no direct opposition; but my mother went into hysterics at the bare mention of the design; and, more than all, my grandfather, from whom I expected much, vowed to cut me off with a shilling if I should ever broach the subject to him again. 326524|6|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2392|These difficulties, however, so far from abating my desire, only added fuel to the flame. 326778|7|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2393|I determined to go at all hazards; and, having made known my intentions to Augustus, we set about arranging a plan by which it might be accomplished. 326867|8|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2394|In the meantime I forbore speaking to any of my relations in regard to the voyage, and, as I busied myself ostensibly with my usual studies, it was supposed that I had abandoned the design. 327016|9|19|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2395|It was about six in the morning when the blow came on with a white squall, and, as usual, from the northward. 327205|0|190|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2396|By eight it had increased very much, and brought down upon us one of the most tremendous seas I had then ever beheld. 327314|1|190|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2397|Every thing had been made as snug as possible, but the schooner laboured excessively, and gave evidence of her bad qualities as a seaboat, pitching her forecastle under at every plunge and with the greatest difficulty struggling up from one wave before she was buried in another. 327431|2|190|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2398|just before sunset the bright spot for which we had been on the look-out made its appearance in the southwest, and in an hour afterward we perceived the little headsail we carried flapping listlessly against the mast. 327710|3|190|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2399|In two minutes more, in spite of every preparation, we were hurled on our beam-ends, as if by magic, and a perfect wilderness of foam made a clear breach over us as we lay. 327927|4|190|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2400|The blow from the southwest, however, luckily proved to be nothing more than a squall, and we had the good fortune to right the vessel without the loss of a spar. 328099|5|190|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2401|A heavy cross sea gave us great trouble for a few hours after this, but toward morning we found ourselves in nearly as good condition as before the gale. 328261|6|190|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2402|Captain Guy considered that he had made an escape little less than miraculous. 328414|7|190|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2403|On the thirteenth of October we came in sight of Prince Edward's Island, in latitude 46 degrees 53' S., longitude 37 degrees 46' E. Two days afterward we found ourselves near Possession Island, and presently passed the islands of Crozet, in latitude 42 degrees 59' S., longitude 48 degrees E. On the eighteenth we made Kerguelen's or Desolation Island, in the Southern Indian Ocean, and came to anchor in Christmas Harbour, having four fathoms of water. 328492|0|191|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2404|This island, or rather group of islands, bears southeast from the Cape of Good Hope, and is distant therefrom nearly eight hundred leagues. 328945|0|192|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2405|It was first discovered in 1772, by the Baron de Kergulen, or Kerguelen, a Frenchman, who, thinking the land to form a portion of an extensive southern continent carried home information to that effect, which produced much excitement at the time. 329084|1|192|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2406|The government, taking the matter up, sent the baron back in the following year for the purpose of giving his new discovery a critical examination, when the mistake was discovered. 329330|2|192|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2407|In 1777, Captain Cook fell in with the same group, and gave to the principal one the name of Desolation Island, a title which it certainly well deserves. 329510|3|192|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2408|Upon approaching the land, however, the navigator might be induced to suppose otherwise, as the sides of most of the hills, from September to March, are clothed with very brilliant verdure. 329663|4|192|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2409|This deceitful appearance is caused by a small plant resembling saxifrage, which is abundant, growing in large patches on a species of crumbling moss. 329852|5|192|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2410|Besides this plant there is scarcely a sign of vegetation on the island, if we except some coarse rank grass near the harbor, some lichen, and a shrub which bears resemblance to a cabbage shooting into seed, and which has a bitter and acrid taste. 330002|6|192|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2411|The face of the country is hilly, although none of the hills can be called lofty. 330249|0|193|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2413|There are several harbors, of which Christmas Harbour is the most convenient. 330375|2|193|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2414|It is the first to be met with on the northeast side of the island after passing Cape Francois, which forms the northern shore, and, by its peculiar shape, serves to distinguish the harbour. 330452|3|193|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2415|Its projecting point terminates in a high rock, through which is a large hole, forming a natural arch. 330642|4|193|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2416|The entrance is in latitude 48 degrees 40' S., longitude 69 degrees 6' E. Passing in here, good anchorage may be found under the shelter of several small islands, which form a sufficient protection from all easterly winds. 330744|5|193|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2417|Proceeding on eastwardly from this anchorage you come to Wasp Bay, at the head of the harbour. 330966|6|193|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2418|This is a small basin, completely landlocked, into which you can go with four fathoms, and find anchorage in from ten to three, hard clay bottom. 331060|7|193|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2419|A ship might lie here with her best bower ahead all the year round without risk. 331205|8|193|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2420|To the westward, at the head of Wasp Bay, is a small stream of excellent water, easily procured. 331285|9|193|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2421|Some seal of the fur and hair species are still to be found on Kerguelen's Island, and sea elephants abound. 331381|0|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2422|The feathered tribes are discovered in great numbers. 331489|1|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2423|The royal penguins which we met with on Kerguelen's Land were rather larger than a goose. 331542|10|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2424|The other kinds are the macaroni, the jackass, and the rookery penguin. 331631|11|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2425|These are much smaller, less beautiful in plumage, and different in other respects. 331702|12|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2426|Penguins are very plenty, and of these there are four different kinds. 331785|2|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2427|The royal penguin, so called from its size and beautiful plumage, is the largest. 331855|3|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2428|The upper part of the body is usually gray, sometimes of a lilac tint; the under portion of the purest white imaginable. 331936|4|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2429|The head is of a glossy and most brilliant black, the feet also. 332056|5|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2430|The chief beauty of plumage, however, consists in two broad stripes of a gold color, which pass along from the head to the breast. 332120|6|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2431|The bill is long, and either pink or bright scarlet. 332250|7|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2432|These birds walk erect; with a stately carriage. 332302|8|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2433|They carry their heads high with their wings drooping like two arms, and, as their tails project from their body in a line with the legs, the resemblance to a human figure is very striking, and would be apt to deceive the spectator at a casual glance or in the gloom of the evening. 332350|9|194|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2434|Besides the penguin many other birds are here to be found, among which may be mentioned sea-hens, blue peterels, teal, ducks, Port Egmont hens, shags, Cape pigeons, the nelly, sea swallows, terns, sea gulls, Mother Carey's chickens, Mother Carey's geese, or the great peterel, and, lastly, the albatross. 332632|0|195|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2435|The great peterel is as large as the common albatross, and is carnivorous. 332936|0|196|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2436|It is frequently called the break-bones, or osprey peterel. 333010|1|196|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2437|They are not at all shy, and, when properly cooked, are palatable food. 333069|2|196|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2438|In flying they sometimes sail very close to the surface of the water, with the wings expanded, without appearing to move them in the least degree, or make any exertion with them whatever. 333140|3|196|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2439|The albatross is one of the largest and fiercest of the South Sea birds. 333327|0|197|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2440|It is of the gull species, and takes its prey on the wing, never coming on land except for the purpose of breeding. 333399|1|197|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2441|Between this bird and the penguin the most singular friendship exists. 333514|2|197|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2442|Their nests are constructed with great uniformity upon a plan concerted between the two species–that of the albatross being placed in the centre of a little square formed by the nests of four penguins. 333584|3|197|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2443|Navigators have agreed in calling an assemblage of such encampments a rookery. 333785|4|197|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2444|These rookeries have been often described, but as my readers may not all have seen these descriptions, and as I shall have occasion hereafter to speak of the penguin and albatross, it will not be amiss to say something here of their mode of building and living. 333863|5|197|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2445|When the season for incubation arrives, the birds assemble in vast numbers, and for some days appear to be deliberating upon the proper course to be pursued. 334124|0|198|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2446|At length they proceed to action. 334281|1|198|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2447|A level piece of ground is selected, of suitable extent, usually comprising three or four acres, and situated as near the sea as possible, being still beyond its reach. 334314|2|198|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2448|The spot is chosen with reference to its evenness of surface, and that is preferred which is the least encumbered with stones. 334482|3|198|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2449|This matter being arranged, the birds proceed, with one accord, and actuated apparently by one mind, to trace out, with mathematical accuracy, either a square or other parallelogram, as may best suit the nature of the ground, and of just sufficient size to accommodate easily all the birds assembled, and no more–in this particular seeming determined upon preventing the access of future stragglers who have not participated in the labor of the encampment. 334608|4|198|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2450|One side of the place thus marked out runs parallel with the water's edge, and is left open for ingress or egress. 335064|5|198|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2451|Having defined the limits of the rookery, the colony now begin to clear it of every species of rubbish, picking up stone by stone, and carrying them outside of the lines, and close by them, so as to form a wall on the three inland sides. 335178|0|199|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2452|Just within this wall a perfectly level and smooth walk is formed, from six to eight feet wide, and extending around the encampment–thus serving the purpose of a general promenade. 335415|1|199|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2453|Notwithstanding this representation, I did not make up my mind to do as he suggested. 335595|0|2|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2454|He afterward proposed (finding that I would not stir in the matter) that I should allow him to draw up, in his own words, a narrative of the earlier portion of my adventures, from facts afforded by myself, publishing it in the Southern Messenger under the garb of fiction. 335680|1|2|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2455|To this, perceiving no objection, I consented, stipulating only that my real name should be retained. 335952|2|2|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2456|Two numbers of the pretended fiction appeared, consequently, in the Messenger for January and February, (1837), and, in order that it might certainly be regarded as fiction, the name of Mr. Poe was affixed to the articles in the table of contents of the magazine. 336053|3|2|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2457|In pursuance of my scheme of deception, I was necessarily obliged to leave much to the management of Augustus, who was employed for the greater part of every day on board the Grampus, attending to some arrangements for his father in the cabin and cabin hold. 336316|0|20|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2458|At night, however, we were sure to have a conference and talk over our hopes. 336574|1|20|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2459|After nearly a month passed in this manner, without our hitting upon any plan we thought likely to succeed, he told me at last that he had determined upon everything necessary. 336651|2|20|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2460|I had a relation living in New Bedford, a Mr. Ross, at whose house I was in the habit of spending occasionally two or three weeks at a time. 336827|3|20|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2461|The brig was to sail about the middle of June (June, 1827), and it was agreed that, a day or two before her putting to sea, my father was to receive a note, as usual, from Mr. Ross, asking me to come over and spend a fortnight with Robert and Emmet (his sons). 336967|4|20|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2462|Augustus charged himself with the inditing of this note and getting it delivered. 337227|5|20|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2463|Having set out as supposed, for New Bedford, I was then to report myself to my companion, who would contrive a hiding-place for me in the Grampus. 337308|6|20|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2464|This hiding-place, he assured me, would be rendered sufficiently comfortable for a residence of many days, during which I was not to make my appearance. 337454|7|20|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2465|When the brig had proceeded so far on her course as to make any turning back a matter out of question, I should then, he said, be formally installed in all the comforts of the cabin; and as to his father, he would only laugh heartily at the joke. 337606|8|20|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2466|Vessels enough would be met with by which a letter might be sent home explaining the adventure to my parents. 337852|9|20|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2467|The next process is to partition out the whole area into small squares exactly equal in size. 337961|0|200|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2468|This is done by forming narrow paths, very smooth, and crossing each other at right angles throughout the entire extent of the rookery. 338054|1|200|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2469|At each intersection of these paths the nest of an albatross is constructed, and a penguin's nest in the centre of each square–thus every penguin is surrounded by four albatrosses, and each albatross by a like number of penguins. 338189|2|200|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2470|The penguin's nest consists of a hole in the earth, very shallow, being only just of sufficient depth to keep her single egg from rolling. 338418|3|200|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2471|The albatross is somewhat less simple in her arrangements, erecting a hillock about a foot high and two in diameter. 338556|4|200|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2472|This is made of earth, seaweed, and shells. 338672|5|200|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2473|On its summit she builds her nest. 338715|6|200|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2474|The birds take especial care never to leave their nests unoccupied for an instant during the period of incubation, or, indeed, until the young progeny are sufficiently strong to take care of themselves. 338749|0|201|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2475|While the male is absent at sea in search of food, the female remains on duty, and it is only upon the return of her partner that she ventures abroad. 338951|1|201|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2476|The eggs are never left uncovered at all–while one bird leaves the nest the other nestling in by its side. 339101|2|201|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2477|This precaution is rendered necessary by the thieving propensities prevalent in the rookery, the inhabitants making no scruple to purloin each other's eggs at every good opportunity. 339207|3|201|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2478|Although there are some rookeries in which the penguin and albatross are the sole population, yet in most of them a variety of oceanic birds are to be met with, enjoying all the privileges of citizenship, and scattering their nests here and there, wherever they can find room, never interfering, however, with the stations of the larger species. 339389|0|202|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2479|The appearance of such encampments, when seen from a distance, is exceedingly singular. 339734|1|202|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2480|The whole atmosphere just above the settlement is darkened with the immense number of the albatross (mingled with the smaller tribes) which are continually hovering over it, either going to the ocean or returning home. 339821|2|202|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2481|At the same time a crowd of penguins are to be observed, some passing to and fro in the narrow alleys, and some marching with the military strut so peculiar to them, around the general promenade ground which encircles the rookery. 340039|3|202|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2482|In short, survey it as we will, nothing can be more astonishing than the spirit of reflection evinced by these feathered beings, and nothing surely can be better calculated to elicit reflection in every well-regulated human intellect. 340269|4|202|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2483|On the morning after our arrival in Christmas Harbour the chief mate, Mr. Patterson, took the boats, and (although it was somewhat early in the season) went in search of seal, leaving the captain and a young relation of his on a point of barren land to the westward, they having some business, whose nature I could not ascertain, to transact in the interior of the island. 340503|0|203|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2484|Captain Guy took with him a bottle, in which was a sealed letter, and made his way from the point on which he was set on shore toward one of the highest peaks in the place. 340875|1|203|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2485|They had remained two nights on the island, owing to some misunderstanding, on the part of the second mate, in regard to the sending a jollyboat from the schooner to take them off. 341047|10|203|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2486|It is probable that his design was to leave the letter on that height for some vessel which he expected to come after him. 341227|2|203|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2487|As soon as we lost sight of him we proceeded (Peters and myself being in the mate's boat) on our cruise around the coast, looking for seal. 341349|3|203|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2488|In this business we were occupied about three weeks, examining with great care every nook and corner, not only of Kerguelen's Land, but of the several small islands in the vicinity. 341488|4|203|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2489|Our labours, however, were not crowned with any important success. 341669|5|203|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2490|We saw a great many fur seal, but they were exceedingly shy, and with the greatest exertions, we could only procure three hundred and fifty skins in all. 341735|6|203|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2491|Sea elephants were abundant, especially on the western coast of the mainland, but of these we killed only twenty, and this with great difficulty. 341888|7|203|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2492|On the smaller islands we discovered a good many of the hair seal, but did not molest them. 342033|8|203|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2493|We returned to the schooner: on the eleventh, where we found Captain Guy and his nephew, who gave a very bad account of the interior, representing it as one of the most dreary and utterly barren countries in the world. 342124|9|203|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2494|On the twelfth we made sail from Christmas Harbour retracing our way to the westward, and leaving Marion's Island, one of Crozet's group, on the larboard. 342342|0|204|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2495|This group, now so well known, and which consists of three circular islands, was first discovered by the Portuguese, and was visited afterward by the Dutch in 1643, and by the French in 1767. 342496|0|205|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2496|The three islands together form a triangle, and are distant from each other about ten miles, there being fine open passages between. 342687|1|205|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2497|The land in all of them is very high, especially in Tristan d'Acunha, properly so called. 342819|2|205|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2498|This is the largest of the group, being fifteen miles in circumference, and so elevated that it can be seen in clear weather at the distance of eighty or ninety miles. 342908|3|205|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2499|A part of the land toward the north rises more than a thousand feet perpendicularly from the sea. 343075|4|205|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2500|A tableland at this height extends back nearly to the centre of the island, and from this tableland arises a lofty cone like that of Teneriffe. 343172|5|205|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2501|The lower half of this cone is clothed with trees of good size, but the upper region is barren rock, usually hidden among the clouds, and covered with snow during the greater part of the year. 343315|6|205|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2502|There are no shoals or other dangers about the island, the shores being remarkably bold and the water deep. 343507|7|205|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2503|On the northwestern coast is a bay, with a beach of black sand where a landing with boats can be easily effected, provided there be a southerly wind. 343614|8|205|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2538|On the fifth of November we made sail to the southward and westward, with the intention of having a thorough search for a group of islands called the Auroras, respecting whose existence a great diversity of opinion has existed. 348340|15|210|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2539|One of these men was named Jonathan Lambert, and he called himself the sovereign of the country. 348567|2|210|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2546|The population occupied themselves chiefly in collecting sealskins and sea elephant oil, with which they traded to the Cape of Good Hope, Glass owning a small schooner. 349682|9|210|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2548|In 1790, Captain Manuel de Oyarvido,, in the ship Princess, belonging to the Royal Philippine Company, sailed, as he asserts, directly among them. 349951|1|211|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2549|"In 1794, the Spanish corvette Atrevida went with the determination of ascertaining their precise situation, and, in a paper published by the Royal Hydrographical Society of Madrid in the year 1809, the following language is used respecting this expedition: ""The corvette Atrevida practised, in their immediate vicinity, from the twenty-first to the twenty-seventh of January, all the necessary observations, and measured by chronometers the difference of longitude between these islands and the port of Soledad in the Manillas. 350097"|2|211|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2553|He reports that, having made the most diligent search and passed not only immediately over the spots indicated by the commander of the Atrevida, but in every direction throughout the vicinity of these spots, he could discover no indication of land. 351025|1|212|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2554|These conflicting statements have induced other navigators to look out for the islands; and, strange to say, while some have sailed through every inch of sea where they are supposed to lie without finding them, there have been not a few who declare positively that they have seen them; and even been close in with their shores. 351273|2|212|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2555|It was Captain Guy's intention to make every exertion within his power to settle the question so oddly in dispute. 351600|3|212|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2556|* Among the vessels which at various times have professed to meet with the Auroras may be mentioned the ship San Miguel, in 1769; the ship Aurora, in 1774; the brig Pearl, in 1779; and the ship Dolores, in 1790. 351714|0|213|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2558|We kept on our course, between the south and west, with variable weather, until the twentieth of the month, when we found ourselves on the debated ground, being in latitude 53 degrees 15' S., longitude 47 degrees 58' W.–that is to say, very nearly upon the spot indicated as the situation of the most southern of the group. 351994|0|214|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2559|Not perceiving any sip of land, we continued to the westward of the parallel of fifty-three degrees south, as far as the meridian of fifty degrees west. 352317|1|214|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2560|We then stood to the north as far as the parallel of fifty-two degrees south, when we turned to the eastward, and kept our parallel by double altitudes, morning and evening, and meridian altitudes of the planets and moon. 352469|2|214|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2561|Having thus gone eastwardly to the meridian of the western coast of Georgia, we kept that meridian until we were in the latitude from which we set out. 352690|3|214|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2562|We then took diagonal courses throughout the entire extent of sea circumscribed, keeping a lookout constantly at the masthead, and repeating our examination with the greatest care for a period of three weeks, during which the weather was remarkably pleasant and fair, with no haze whatsoever. 352841|4|214|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2563|Of course we were thoroughly satisfied that, whatever islands might have existed in this vicinity at any former period, no vestige of them remained at the present day. 353133|5|214|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2564|Since my return home I find that the same ground was traced over, with equal care, in 1822, by Captain Johnson, of the American schooner Henry, and by Captain Morrell in the American schooner Wasp–in both cases with the same result as in our own. 353300|6|214|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2565|It had been Captain Guy's original intention, after satisfying himself about the Auroras, to proceed through the Strait of Magellan, and up along the western coast of Patagonia; but information received at Tristan d'Acunha induced him to steer to the southward, in the hope of falling in with some small islands said to lie about the parallel of 60 degrees S., longitude 41 degrees 20' W. In the event of his not discovering these lands, he designed, should the season prove favourable, to push on toward the pole. 353546|0|215|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2566|Accordingly, on the twelfth of December, we made sail in that direction. 354060|1|215|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2567|On the eighteenth we found ourselves about the station indicated by Glass, and cruised for three days in that neighborhood without finding any traces of the islands he had mentioned. 354132|2|215|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2568|On the twenty-first, the weather being unusually pleasant, we again made sail to the southward, with the resolution of penetrating in that course as far as possible. 354314|3|215|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2569|Before entering upon this portion of my narrative, it may be as well, for the information of those readers who have paid little attention to the progress of discovery in these regions, to give some brief account of the very few attempts at reaching the southern pole which have hitherto been made. 354479|4|215|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2572|In December he found himself as far as the fifty-eighth parallel of south latitude, and in longitude 26 degrees 57' E.

2573|This ice was in large cakes, and usually it was packed so closely that the vessel had great difficulty in forcing a passage. 355178|3|216|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2574|At this period Captain Cook supposed, from the vast number of birds to be seen, and from other indications, that he was in the near vicinity of land. 355302|4|216|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2575|He kept on to the southward, the weather being exceedingly cold, until he reached the sixty-fourth parallel, in longitude 38 degrees 14' W.. 355451|5|216|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2577|In January, 1773, the vessels crossed the Antarctic circle, but did not succeed in penetrating much farther; for upon reaching latitude 67 degrees 15' they found all farther progress impeded by an immense body of ice, extending all along the southern horizon as far as the eye could reach. 355689|7|216|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2578|This ice was of every variety–and some large floes of it, miles in extent, formed a compact mass, rising eighteen or twenty feet above the water. 355978|8|216|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2579|It being late in the season, and no hope entertained of rounding these obstructions, Captain Cook now reluctantly turned to the northward. 356123|9|216|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2582|"""We are not surprised that Captain Cook was unable to go beyond 71 degrees 10', but we are astonished that he did attain that point on the meridian of 106 degrees 54' west longitude. 356407"|10|217|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2583|Palmer's Land lies south of the Shetland, latitude sixty-four degrees, and tends to the southward and westward farther than any navigator has yet penetrated. 356589|11|217|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2584|"Cook was standing for this land when his progress was arrested by the ice; which, we apprehend, must always be the case in that point, and so early in the season as the sixth of January–and we should not be surprised if a portion of the icy mountains described was attached to the main body of Palmer's Land, or to some other portions of land lying farther to the southward and westward"". 356746"|12|217|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2585|In December, when the vessels were in latitude 67 degrees 31', longitude 142 degrees 54' W., the cold was excessive, with heavy gales and fog. 357134|2|217|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2586|Here also birds were abundant; the albatross, the penguin, and the peterel especially. 357276|3|217|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2587|In latitude 70 degrees 23' some large islands of ice were encountered, and shortly afterward the clouds to the southward were observed to be of a snowy whiteness, indicating the vicinity of field ice. 357362|4|217|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2588|In latitude 71 degrees 10', longitude 106 degrees 54' W., the navigators were stopped, as before, by an immense frozen expanse, which filled the whole area of the southern horizon. 357562|5|217|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2589|The northern edge of this expanse was ragged and broken, so firmly wedged together as to be utterly impassible, and extending about a mile to the southward. 357742|6|217|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2590|Behind it the frozen surface was comparatively smooth for some distance, until terminated in the extreme background by gigantic ranges of ice mountains, the one towering above the other. 357898|7|217|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2594|In endeavouring to get south, they made no farther than 59 degrees 58', in longitude 70 degrees 15' W. They here met with strong currents setting eastwardly. 358540|1|218|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2595|Whales were abundant, but they saw no ice. 358697|2|218|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2596|In regard to this voyage, Mr. Reynolds observes that, if Kreutzenstern had arrived where he did earlier in the season, he must have encountered ice–it was March when he reached the latitude specified. 358739|3|218|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2597|The winds, prevailing, as they do, from the southward and westward, had carried the floes, aided by currents, into that icy region bounded on the north by Georgia, east by Sandwich Land and the South Orkneys, and west by the South Shetland islands. 358939|4|218|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2598|In 1822, Captain James Weddell, of the British navy, with two very small vessels, penetrated farther to the south than any previous navigator, and this, too, without encountering extraordinary difficulties. 359187|0|219|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2599|He states that although he was frequently hemmed in by ice before reaching the seventy-second parallel, yet, upon attaining it, not a particle was to be discovered, and that, upon arriving at the latitude of 74 degrees 15', no fields, and only three islands of ice were visible. 359393|1|219|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2600|It is somewhat remarkable that, although vast flocks of birds were seen, and other usual indications of land, and although, south of the Shetlands, unknown coasts were observed from the masthead tending southwardly, Weddell discourages the idea of land existing in the polar regions of the south. 359671|2|219|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2601|After this narrow escape we proceeded with greater caution, and arrived at our point of destination in safety. 359967|0|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2602|There were only one or two of the hands on board, and these were busy forward, doing something to the forecastle combings. 360077|1|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2603|He led the way into his own stateroom, which was on the starboard side of the brig, and next to the bulkheads. 360199|10|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2604|Upon entering, he closed the door and bolted it. 360309|11|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2605|I thought I had never seen a nicer little room than the one in which I now found myself. 360357|12|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2606|It was about ten feet long, and had only one berth, which, as I said before, was wide and convenient. 360445|13|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2607|In that portion of the closet nearest the bulkheads there was a space of four feet square, containing a table, a chair, and a set of hanging shelves full of books, chiefly books of voyages and travels. 360546|14|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2608|There were many other little comforts in the room, among which I ought not to forget a kind of safe or refrigerator, in which Augustus pointed out to me a host of delicacies, both in the eating and drinking department. 360747|15|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2609|Captain Barnard, we knew very well, was engaged at Lloyd and Vredenburgh's, and would remain there until late in the evening, so we had little to apprehend on his account. 360965|2|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2610|Augustus went first up the vessel's side, and in a short while I followed him, without being noticed by the men at work. 361136|3|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2611|We proceeded at once into the cabin, and found no person there. 361256|4|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2612|It was fitted up in the most comfortable style–a thing somewhat unusual in a whaling-vessel. 361319|5|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2613|There were four very excellent staterooms, with wide and convenient berths. 361411|6|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2614|There was also a large stove, I took notice, and a remarkably thick and valuable carpet covering the floor of both the cabin and staterooms. 361486|7|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2615|The ceiling was full seven feet high, and, in short, every thing appeared of a more roomy and agreeable nature than I had anticipated. 361626|8|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2616|Augustus, however, would allow me but little time for observation, insisting upon the necessity of my concealing myself as soon as possible. 361760|9|22|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2617|On the 11th of January, 1823, Captain Benjamin Morrell, of the American schooner Wasp, sailed from Kerguelen's Land with a view of penetrating as far south as possible. 361900|0|220|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2618|On the first of February he found himself in latitude 64 degrees 52' S., longitude 118 degrees 27' E. The following passage is extracted from his journal of that date. 362068|1|220|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2619|"""The wind soon freshened to an eleven-knot breeze, and we embraced this opportunity of making to the west,; being however convinced that the farther we went south beyond latitude sixty-four degrees, the less ice was to be apprehended, we steered a little to the southward, until we crossed the Antarctic circle, and were in latitude 69 degrees 15' E. In this latitude there was no field ice, and very few ice islands in sight. 362235"|2|220|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2622|At the same time the temperature of the air and water was at least thirteen degrees higher (more mild) than we had ever found it between the parallels of sixty and sixty-two south. 362821|2|221|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2625|I have several times passed within the Antarctic circle, on different meridians, and have uniformly found the temperature, both of the air and the water, to become more and more mild the farther I advanced beyond the sixty-fifth degree of south latitude, and that the variation decreases in the same proportion. 363208|8|221|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2626|"While north of this latitude, say between sixty and sixty-five south, we frequently had great difficulty in finding a passage for the vessel between the immense and almost innumerable ice islands, some of which were from one to two miles in circumference, and more than five hundred feet above the surface of the water"". 363519"|9|221|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2627|Being nearly destitute of fuel and water, and without proper instruments, it being also late in the season, Captain Morrell was now obliged to put back, without attempting any further progress to the westward, although an entirely open, sea lay before him. 363839|0|222|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2628|He expresses the opinion that, had not these overruling considerations obliged him to retreat, he could have penetrated, if not to the pole itself, at least to the eighty-fifth parallel. 364095|1|222|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2677|Its girth was probably, at the base, three-quarters of a league, and several streams of water were running from crevices in its sides. 370658|3|230|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2678|We remained in sight of this island two days, and then only lost it in a fog. 370792|4|230|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2680|–Early this morning we had the misfortune to lose a man overboard. 370880|1|231|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2681|He was an American named Peter Vredenburgh, a native of New York, and was one of the most valuable hands on board the schooner. 370946|2|231|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2682|In going over the bows his foot slipped, and he fell between two cakes of ice, never rising again. 371073|3|231|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2683|At noon of this day we were in latitude 78 degrees 30', longitude 40 degrees 15' W. The cold was now excessive, and we had hail squalls continually from the northward and eastward. 371171|4|231|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2684|In this direction also we saw several more immense icebergs, and the whole horizon to the eastward appeared to be blocked up with field ice, rising in tiers, one mass above the other. 371351|5|231|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2685|Some driftwood floated by during the evening, and a great quantity of birds flew over, among which were nellies, peterels, albatrosses, and a large bird of a brilliant blue plumage. 371534|6|231|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2686|The variation here, per azimuth, was less than it had been previously to our passing the Antarctic circle. 371715|7|231|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2688|-Our passage to the south again looked doubtful, as nothing was to be seen in the direction of the pole but one apparently limitless floe, backed by absolute mountains of ragged ice, one precipice of which arose frowningly above the other. 371832|1|232|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2689|We stood to the westward until the fourteenth, in the hope of finding an entrance. 372071|2|232|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2691|-This morning we reached the western extremity of the field which had impeded us, and, weathering it, came to an open sea, without a particle of ice. 372164|1|233|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2692|Upon sounding with two hundred fathoms, we here found a current setting southwardly at the rate of half a mile per hour. 372313|2|233|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2693|The temperature of the air was forty-seven, that of the water thirtyfour. 372433|3|233|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2694|We now sailed to the southward without meeting any interruption of moment until the sixteenth, when, at noon, we were in latitude 81 degrees 21', longitude 42 degrees W. We here again sounded, and found a current setting still southwardly, and at the rate of three quarters of a mile per hour. 372506|4|233|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2695|The variation per azimuth had diminished, and the temperature of the air was mild and pleasant, the thermometer being as high as fifty-one. 372799|5|233|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2696|At this period not a particle of ice was to be discovered. 372938|6|233|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2697|All hands on board now felt certain of attaining the pole. 372996|7|233|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2699|–This day was full of incident. 373065|1|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2700|Owing to the confusion which ensued among us at this unexpected turn of the adventure, no person was ready immediately with a second shot, and the bear had actually succeeded in getting half his vast bulk across our gunwale, and seizing one of the men by the small of his back, before any efficient means were taken to repel him. 373096|10|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2701|In this extremity nothing but the promptness and agility of Peters saved us from destruction. 373425|11|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2702|Leaping upon the back of the huge beast, he plunged the blade of a knife behind the neck, reaching the spinal marrow at a blow. 373518|12|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2703|The brute tumbled into the sea lifeless, and without a struggle, rolling over Peters as he fell. 373645|13|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2704|The latter soon recovered himself, and a rope being thrown him, returned in triumph to the schooner, towing our trophy behind us. 373741|14|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2705|This bear, upon admeasurement, proved to be full fifteen feet in his greatest length. 373870|15|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2706|His wool was perfectly white, and very coarse, curling tightly. 373955|16|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2707|The eyes were of a blood red, and larger than those of the Arctic bear, the snout also more rounded, rather resembling the snout of the bulldog. 374018|17|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2708|The meat was tender, but excessively rank and fishy, although the men devoured it with avidity, and declared it excellent eating. 374162|18|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2709|Innumerable flights of birds flew over us from the southward, and several were shot from the deck, one of them, a species of pelican, proved to be excellent eating. 374291|2|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2710|About midday a small floe of ice was seen from the masthead off the larboard bow, and upon it there appeared to be some large animal. 374455|3|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2711|As the weather was good and nearly calm, Captain Guy ordered out two of the boats to see what it was. 374588|4|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2712|Dirk Peters and myself accompanied the mate in the larger boat. 374689|5|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2713|Upon coming up with the floe, we perceived that it was in the possession of a gigantic creature of the race of the Arctic bear, but far exceeding in size the largest of these animals. 374752|6|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2714|Being well armed, we made no scruple of attacking it at once. 374935|7|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2715|Several shots were fired in quick succession, the most of which took effect, apparently, in the head and body. 374996|8|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2716|Nothing discouraged, however, the monster threw himself from the ice, and swam with open jaws, to the boat in which were Peters and myself. 375106|9|234|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2717|"Scarcely had we got our prize alongside, when the man at the masthead gave the joyful shout of ""land on the starboard bow""! 375245"|0|235|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2718|All hands were now upon the alert, and, a breeze springing up very opportunely from the northward and eastward, we were soon close in with the coast. 375368|1|235|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2719|It proved to be a low rocky islet, of about a league in circumference, and altogether destitute of vegetation, if we except a species of prickly pear. 375517|2|235|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2720|In approaching it from the northward, a singular ledge of rock is seen projecting into the sea, and bearing a strong resemblance to corded bales of cotton. 375667|3|235|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2721|Around this ledge to the westward is a small bay, at the bottom of which our boats effected a convenient landing. 375822|4|235|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2722|It did not take us long to explore every portion of the island, but, with one exception, we found nothing worthy of our observation. 375935|0|236|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2723|In the southern extremity, we picked up near the shore, half buried in a pile of loose stones, a piece of wood, which seemed to have formed the prow of a canoe. 376067|1|236|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2724|There had been evidently some attempt at carving upon it, and Captain Guy fancied that he made out the figure of a tortoise, but the resemblance did not strike me very forcibly. 376227|2|236|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2725|Besides this prow, if such it were, we found no other token that any living creature had ever been here before. 376404|3|236|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2726|Around the coast we discovered occasional small floes of ice–but these were very few. 376515|4|236|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2727|The exact situation of the islet (to which Captain Guy gave the name of Bennet's Islet, in honour of his partner in the ownership of the schooner) is 82 degrees 50' S. latitude, 42 degrees 20' W. longitude. 376600|5|236|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2728|We had now advanced to the southward more than eight degrees farther than any previous navigators, and the sea still lay perfectly open before us. 376806|0|237|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2729|We found, too, that the variation uniformly decreased as we proceeded, and, what was still more surprising, that the temperature of the air, and latterly of the water, became milder. 376952|1|237|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2730|The weather might even be called pleasant, and we had a steady but very gentle breeze always from some northern point of the compass. 377134|2|237|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2731|The sky was usually clear, with now and then a slight appearance of thin vapour in the southern horizon–this, however, was invariably of brief duration. 377267|3|237|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2732|Two difficulties alone presented themselves to our view; we were getting short of fuel, and symptoms of scurvy had occurred among several of the crew. 377419|4|237|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2733|These considerations began to impress upon Captain Guy the necessity of returning, and he spoke of it frequently. 377569|5|237|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2734|For my own part, confident as I was of soon arriving at land of some description upon the course we were pursuing, and having every reason to believe, from present appearances, that we should not find it the sterile soil met with in the higher Arctic latitudes, I warmly pressed upon him the expediency of persevering, at least for a few days longer, in the direction we were now holding. 377682|6|237|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2735|So tempting an opportunity of solving the great problem in regard to an Antarctic continent had never yet been afforded to man, and I confess that I felt myself bursting with indignation at the timid and ill-timed suggestions of our commander. 378070|7|237|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2736|I believe, indeed, that what I could not refrain from saying to him on this head had the effect of inducing him to push on. 378313|8|237|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2737|While, therefore, I cannot but lament the most unfortunate and bloody events which immediately arose from my advice, I must still be allowed to feel some degree of gratification at having been instrumental, however remotely, in opening to the eye of science one of the most intensely exciting secrets which has ever engrossed its attention. 378436|9|237|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2739|–This morning* we continued to the southward, with the same pleasant weather as before. 378787|1|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2740|The body was covered with a straight silky hair, perfectly white. 378874|10|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2741|The tail was peaked like that of a rat, and about a foot and a half long. 378939|11|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2742|The head resembled a cat's, with the exception of the ears–these were flopped like the ears of a dog. 379012|12|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2743|The teeth were of the same brilliant scarlet as the claws. 379113|13|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2744|The sea was entirely smooth, the air tolerably warm and from the northeast, the temperature of the water fifty-three. 379171|2|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2745|We now again got our sounding-gear in order, and, with a hundred and fifty fathoms of line, found the current setting toward the pole at the rate of a mile an hour. 379288|3|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2746|This constant tendency to the southward, both in the wind and current, caused some degree of speculation, and even of alarm, in different quarters of the schooner, and I saw distinctly that no little impression had been made upon the mind of Captain Guy. 379452|4|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2747|He was exceedingly sensitive to ridicule, however, and I finally succeeded in laughing him out of his apprehensions. 379706|5|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2748|The variation was now very trivial. 379822|6|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2749|In the course of the day we saw several large whales of the right species, and innumerable flights of the albatross passed over the vessel. 379857|7|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2750|We also picked up a bush, full of red berries, like those of the hawthorn, and the carcass of a singular-looking land-animal. 379996|8|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2751|It was three feet in length, and but six inches in height, with four very short legs, the feet armed with long claws of a brilliant scarlet, and resembling coral in substance. 380121|9|238|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2752|* The terms morning and evening, which I have made use of to avoid confusion in my narrative, as far as possible, must not, of course, be taken in their ordinary sense. 380296|0|239|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2755|I would also remark, in this place, that I cannot, in the first portion of what is here written, pretend to strict accuracy in respect to dates, or latitudes and longitudes, having kept no regular journal until after the period of which this first portion treats. 380645|3|239|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2757|The taper gave out so feeble a ray that it was with the greatest difficulty I could grope my way through the confused mass of lumber among which I now found myself. 380963|0|24|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2758|By degrees, however, my eyes became accustomed to the gloom, and I proceeded with less trouble, holding on to the skirts of my friend's coat. 381127|1|24|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2759|He brought me, at length, after creeping and winding through innumerable narrow passages, to an iron-bound box, such as is used sometimes for packing fine earthenware. 381268|2|24|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2760|It was nearly four feet high, and full six long, but very narrow. 381435|3|24|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2761|Two large empty oil-casks lay on the top of it, and above these, again, a vast quantity of straw matting, piled up as high as the floor of the cabin. 381500|4|24|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2762|In every other direction around was wedged as closely as possible, even up to the ceiling, a complete chaos of almost every species of ship-furniture, together with a heterogeneous medley of crates, hampers, barrels, and bales, so that it seemed a matter no less than miraculous that we had discovered any passage at all to the box. 381649|5|24|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2765|–To-day, being in latitude 83 degrees 20', longitude 43 degrees 5' W. (the sea being of an extraordinarily dark colour), we again saw land from the masthead, and, upon a closer scrutiny, found it to be one of a group of very large islands. 382201|1|240|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2766|The shore was precipitous, and the interior seemed to be well wooded, a circumstance which occasioned us great joy. 382440|2|240|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2767|In about four hours from our first discovering the land we came to anchor in ten fathoms, sandy bottom, a league from the coast, as a high surf, with strong ripples here and there, rendered a nearer approach of doubtful expediency. 382555|3|240|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2768|The two largest boats were now ordered out, and a party, well armed (among whom were Peters and myself), proceeded to look for an opening in the reef which appeared to encircle the island. 382786|4|240|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2769|After searching about for some time, we discovered an inlet, which we were entering, when we saw four large canoes put off from the shore, filled with men who seemed to be well armed. 382974|5|240|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2770|We waited for them to come up, and, as they moved with great rapidity, they were soon within hail. 383157|6|240|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2771|Captain Guy now held up a white handkerchief on the blade of an oar, when the strangers made a full stop, and commenced a loud jabbering all at once, intermingled with occasional shouts, in which we could distinguish the words Anamoo-moo! 383255|7|240|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2772|and Lama-Lama! 383493|8|240|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2773|They continued this for at least half an hour, during which we had a good opportunity of observing their appearance. 383507|9|240|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2774|In the four canoes, which might have been fifty feet long and five broad, there were a hundred and ten savages in all. 383623|0|241|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2775|They were about the ordinary stature of Europeans, but of a more muscular and brawny frame. 383741|1|241|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2776|Their complexion a jet black, with thick and long woolly hair. 383832|2|241|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2777|They were clothed in skins of an unknown black animal, shaggy and silky, and made to fit the body with some degree of skill, the hair being inside, except where turned out about the neck, wrists, and ankles. 383894|3|241|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2778|Their arms consisted principally of clubs, of a dark, and apparently very heavy wood. 384101|4|241|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2779|Some spears, however, were observed among them, headed with flint, and a few slings. 384186|5|241|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2780|The bottoms of the canoes were full of black stones about the size of a large egg. 384270|6|241|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2781|When they had concluded their harangue (for it was clear they intended their jabbering for such), one of them who seemed to be the chief stood up in the prow of his canoe, and made signs for us to bring our boats alongside of him. 384352|0|242|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2782|This hint we pretended not to understand, thinking it the wiser plan to maintain, if possible, the interval between us, as their number more than quadrupled our own. 384582|1|242|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2783|Finding this to be the case, the chief ordered the three other canoes to hold back, while he advanced toward us with his own. 384747|2|242|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2784|As soon as he came up with us he leaped on board the largest of our boats, and seated himself by the side of Captain Guy, pointing at the same time to the schooner, and repeating the word Anamoo-moo! 384872|3|242|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2785|and Lama-Lama! 385071|4|242|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2786|We now put back to the vessel, the four canoes following at a little distance. 385085|5|242|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2787|Upon getting alongside, the chief evinced symptoms of extreme surprise and delight, clapping his hands, slapping his thighs and breast, and laughing obstreperously. 385163|0|243|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2788|His followers behind joined in his merriment, and for some minutes the din was so excessive as to be absolutely deafening. 385327|1|243|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2789|Quiet being at length restored, Captain Guy ordered the boats to be hoisted up, as a necessary precaution, and gave the chief (whose name we soon found to be Too-wit) to understand that we could admit no more than twenty of his men on deck at one time. 385449|2|243|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2790|With this arrangement he appeared perfectly satisfied, and gave some directions to the canoes, when one of them approached, the rest remaining about fifty yards off. 385701|3|243|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2791|Twenty of the savages now got on board, and proceeded to ramble over every part of the deck, and scramble about among the rigging, making themselves much at home, and examining every article with great inquisitiveness. 385866|4|243|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2792|It was quite evident that they had never before seen any of the white race–from whose complexion, indeed, they appeared to recoil. 386084|0|244|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2793|They believed the Jane to be a living creature, and seemed to be afraid of hurting it with the points of their spears, carefully turning them up. 386214|1|244|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2794|Our crew were much amused with the conduct of Too-wit in one instance. 386359|2|244|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2795|The cook was splitting some wood near the galley, and, by accident, struck his axe into the deck, making a gash of considerable depth. 386429|3|244|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2796|The chief immediately ran up, and pushing the cook on one side rather roughly, commenced a half whine, half howl, strongly indicative of sympathy in what he considered the sufferings of the schooner, patting and smoothing the gash with his hand, and washing it from a bucket of seawater which stood by. 386563|4|244|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2797|This was a degree of ignorance for which we were not prepared, and for my part I could not help thinking some of it affected. 386865|5|244|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2798|When the visitors had satisfied, as well as they could, their curiosity in regard to our upper works, they were admitted below, when their amazement exceeded all bounds. 386990|0|245|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2799|Their astonishment now appeared to be far too deep for words, for they roamed about in silence, broken only by low ejaculations. 387159|1|245|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2800|The arms afforded them much food for speculation, and they were suffered to handle and examine them at leisure. 387287|2|245|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2801|I do not believe that they had the least suspicion of their actual use, but rather took them for idols, seeing the care we had of them, and the attention with which we watched their movements while handling them. 387398|3|245|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2802|At the great guns their wonder was redoubled. 387610|4|245|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2803|They approached them with every mark of the profoundest reverence and awe, but forbore to examine them minutely. 387655|5|245|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2804|There were two large mirrors in the cabin, and here was the acme of their amazement. 387767|6|245|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2805|Too-wit was the first to approach them, and he had got in the middle of the cabin, with his face to one and his back to the other, before he fairly perceived them. 387851|7|245|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2806|Upon raising his eyes and seeing his reflected self in the glass, I thought the savage would go mad; but, upon turning short round to make a retreat, and beholding himself a second time in the opposite direction, I was afraid he would expire upon the spot. 388014|8|245|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2807|No persuasion could prevail upon him to take another look; throwing himself upon the floor, with his face buried in his hands, he remained thus until we were obliged to drag him upon deck. 388270|9|245|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2808|The whole of the savages were admitted on board in this manner, twenty at a time, Too-wit being suffered to remain during the entire period. 388458|0|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2809|We saw no disposition to thievery among them, nor did we miss a single article after their departure. 388598|1|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2810|I represented to the captain that we might easily make this group on our return, and winter here in the event of being blocked up by the ice. 388699|10|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2811|He at length came into my views (for in some way, hardly known to myself, I had acquired much influence over him), and it was finally resolved that, even in the event of our finding biche de mer, we should only stay here a week to recruit, and then push on to the southward while we might. 388840|11|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2812|Accordingly we made every necessary preparation, and, under the guidance of Too-wit, got the Jane through the reef in safety, coming to anchor about a mile from the shore, in an excellent bay, completely landlocked, on the southeastern coast of the main island, and in ten fathoms of water, black sandy bottom. 389129|12|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2813|At the head of this bay there were three fine springs (we were told) of good water, and we saw abundance of wood in the vicinity. 389439|13|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2814|The four canoes followed us in, keeping, however, at a respectful distance. 389568|14|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2815|Too-wit himself remained on board, and, upon our dropping anchor, invited us to accompany him on shore, and visit his village in the interior. 389643|15|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2816|To this Captain Guy consented; and ten savages being left on board as hostages, a party of us, twelve in all, got in readiness to attend the chief. 389785|16|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2817|We took care to be well armed, yet without evincing any distrust. 389932|17|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2818|The schooner had her guns run out, her boarding-nettings up, and every other proper precaution was taken to guard against surprise. 389997|18|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2819|Directions were left with the chief mate to admit no person on board during our absence, and, in the event of our not appearing in twelve hours, to send the cutter, with a swivel, around the island in search of us. 390128|19|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2820|Throughout the whole of their visit they evinced the most friendly manner. 390342|2|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2821|There were, however, some points in their demeanour which we found it impossible to understand; for example, we could not get them to approach several very harmless objects–such as the schooner's sails, an egg, an open book, or a pan of flour. 390416|3|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2822|We endeavoured to ascertain if they had among them any articles which might be turned to account in the way of traffic, but found great difficulty in being comprehended. 390659|4|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2823|We made out, nevertheless, what greatly astonished us, that the islands abounded in the large tortoise of the Gallipagos, one of which we saw in the canoe of Too-wit. 390828|5|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2824|We saw also some biche de mer in the hands of one of the savages, who was greedily devouring it in its natural state. 390994|6|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2825|These anomalies–for they were such when considered in regard to the latitude–induced Captain Guy to wish for a thorough investigation of the country, in the hope of making a profitable speculation in his discovery. 391111|7|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2826|For my own part, anxious as I was to know something more of these islands, I was still more earnestly bent on prosecuting the voyage to the southward without delay. 391325|8|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2827|We had now fine weather, but there was no telling how long it would last; and being already in the eighty-fourth parallel, with an open sea before us, a current setting strongly to the southward, and the wind fair, I could not listen with any patience to a proposition of stopping longer than was absolutely necessary for the health of the crew and the taking on board a proper supply of fuel and fresh provisions. 391489|9|246|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2828|At every step we took inland the conviction forced itself upon us that we were in a country differing essentially from any hitherto visited by civilized men. 391903|0|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2829|We saw nothing with which we had been formerly conversant. 392060|1|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2830|semblance, as regards consistency, to a thick infusion of gum arabic in common water. 392118|10|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2831|But this was only the least remarkable of its extraordinary qualities. 392203|11|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2832|It was not colourless, nor was it of any one uniform colour–presenting to the eye, as it flowed, every possible shade of purple; like the hues of a changeable silk. 392273|12|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2833|This variation in shade was produced in a manner which excited as profound astonishment in the minds of our party as the mirror had done in the case of Too-wit. 392437|13|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2834|Upon collecting a basinful, and allowing it to settle thoroughly, we perceived that the whole mass of liquid was made up of a number of distinct veins, each of a distinct hue; that these veins did not commingle; and that their cohesion was perfect in regard to their own particles among themselves, and imperfect in regard to neighbouring veins. 392597|14|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2835|Upon passing the blade of a knife athwart the veins, the water closed over it immediately, as with us, and also, in withdrawing it, all traces of the passage of the knife were instantly obliterated. 392942|15|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2836|If, however, the blade was passed down accurately between the two veins, a perfect separation was effected, which the power of cohesion did not immediately rectify. 393140|16|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2837|The phenomena of this water formed the first definite link in that vast chain of apparent miracles with which I was destined to be at length encircled. 393304|17|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2838|The trees resembled no growth of either the torrid, the temperate, of the northern frigid zones, and were altogether unlike those of the lower southern latitudes we had already traversed. 393455|2|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2839|The very rocks were novel in their mass, their color, and their stratification; and the streams themselves, utterly incredible as it may appear, had so little in common with those of other climates, that we were scrupulous of tasting them, and, indeed, had difficulty in bringing ourselves to believe that their qualities were purely those of nature. 393642|3|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2840|At a small brook which crossed our path (the first we had reached) Too-wit and his attendants halted to drink. 393992|4|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2841|On account of the singular character of the water, we refused to taste it, supposing it to be polluted; and it was not until some time afterward we came to understand that such was the appearance of the streams throughout the whole group. 394102|5|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2842|I am at a loss to give a distinct idea of the nature of this liquid, and cannot do so without many words. 394340|6|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2843|Although it flowed with rapidity in all declivities where common water would do so, yet never, except when falling in a cascade, had it the customary appearance of limpidity. 394445|7|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2844|It was, nevertheless, in point of fact, as perfectly limpid as any limestone water in existence, the difference being only in appearance. 394619|8|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2845|At first sight, and especially in cases where little declivity was found, it bore re. 394756|9|247|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2846|We were nearly three hours in reaching the village, it being more than nine miles in the interior, and the path lying through a rugged country. 394841|0|248|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2847|As we passed along, the party of Too-wit (the whole hundred and ten savages of the canoes) was momentarily strengthened by smaller detachments, of from two to six or seven, which joined us, as if by accident, at different turns of the road. 394984|1|248|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2848|There appeared so much of system in this that I could not help feeling distrust, and I spoke to Captain Guy of my apprehensions. 395224|2|248|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2849|It was now too late, however, to recede, and we concluded that our best security lay in evincing a perfect confidence in the good faith of Too-wit. 395352|3|248|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2850|We accordingly went on, keeping a wary eye upon the manoeuvres of the savages, and not permitting them to divide our numbers by pushing in between. 395499|4|248|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2851|In this way, passing through a precipitous ravine, we at length reached what we were told was the only collection of habitations upon the island. 395646|5|248|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2852|As we came in sight of them, the chief set up a shout, and frequently repeated the word Klock-klock, which we sup. 395791|6|248|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2854|The dwellings were of the most miserable description imaginable, and, unlike those of even the lowest of the savage races with which mankind are acquainted, were of no uniform plan. 395983|0|249|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2855|Some of them (and these we found belonged to the Wampoos or Yampoos, the great men of the land) consisted of a tree cut down at about four feet from the root, with a large black skin thrown over it, and hanging in loose folds upon the ground. 396164|1|249|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2856|Under this the savage nestled. 396406|2|249|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2857|Others were formed by means of rough limbs of trees, with the withered foliage upon them, made to recline, at an angle of forty-five degrees, against a bank of clay, heaped up, without regular form, to the height of five or six feet. 396436|3|249|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2858|Others, again, were mere holes dug in the earth perpendicularly, and covered over with similar branches, these being removed when the tenant was about to enter, and pulled on again when he had entered. 396669|4|249|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2859|A few were built among the forked limbs of trees as they stood, the upper limbs being partially cut through, so as to bend over upon the lower, thus forming thicker shelter from the weather. 396870|5|249|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2860|The greater number, however, consisted of small shallow caverns, apparently scratched in the face of a precipitous ledge of dark stone, resembling fuller's earth, with which three sides of the village were bounded. 397060|6|249|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2861|At the door of each of these primitive caverns was a small rock, which the tenant carefully placed before the entrance upon leaving his residence, for what purpose I could not ascertain, as the stone itself was never of sufficient size to close up more than a third of the opening. 397274|7|249|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2862|My companion now showed me that one of the ends of the box could be removed at pleasure. 397555|0|25|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2863|He slipped it aside and displayed the interior, at which I was excessively amused. 397643|1|25|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2864|A mattress from one of the cabin berths covered the whole of its bottom, and it contained almost every article of mere comfort which could be crowded into so small a space, allowing me, at the same time, sufficient room for my accommodation, either in a sitting position or lying at full length. 397725|2|25|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2865|Among other things, there were some books, pen, ink, and paper, three blankets, a large jug full of water, a keg of sea-biscuit, three or four immense Bologna sausages, an enormous ham, a cold leg of roast mutton, and half a dozen bottles of cordials and liqueurs. 398020|3|25|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2866|I proceeded immediately to take possession of my little apartment, and this with feelings of higher satisfaction, I am sure, than any monarch ever experienced upon entering a new palace. 398284|4|25|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2867|Augustus now pointed out to me the method of fastening the open end of the box, and then, holding the taper close to the deck, showed me a piece of dark whipcord lying along it. 398470|5|25|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2868|This, he said, extended from my hiding-place throughout an the necessary windings among the lumber, to a nail which was driven into the deck of the hold, immediately beneath the trap-door leading into his stateroom. 398647|6|25|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2869|By means of this cord I should be enabled readily to trace my way out without his guidance, provided any unlooked-for accident should render such a step necessary. 398862|7|25|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2870|He now took his departure, leaving with me the lantern, together with a copious supply of tapers and phosphorous, and promising to pay me a visit as often as he could contrive to do so without observation. 399025|8|25|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2871|This was on the seventeenth of June. 399230|9|25|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2872|This village, if it were worthy of the name, lay in a valley of some depth, and could only be approached from the southward, the precipitous ledge of which I have already spoken cutting off all access in other directions. 399266|0|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2873|Through the middle of the valley ran a brawling stream of the same magical-looking water which has been described. 399487|1|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2874|Of fish there seemed to be a great abundance. 399601|10|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2875|We saw, during our visit, a quantity of dried salmon, rock cod, blue dolphins, mackerel, blackfish, skate, conger eels, elephantfish, mullets, soles, parrotfish, leather-jackets, gurnards, hake, flounders, paracutas, and innumerable other varieties. 399646|11|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2876|We noticed, too, that most of them were similar to the fish about the group of Lord Auckland Islands, in a latitude as low as fifty-one degrees south. 399895|12|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2877|The Gallipago tortoise was also very plentiful. 400045|13|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2878|We saw but few wild animals, and none of a large size, or of a species with which we were familiar. 400092|14|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2879|One or two serpents of a formidable aspect crossed our path, but the natives paid them little attention, and we concluded that they were not venomous. 400191|15|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2880|We saw several strange animals about the dwellings, all appearing to be thoroughly domesticated. 400341|2|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2881|The largest of these creatures resembled our common hog in the structure of the body and snout; the tail, however, was bushy, and the legs slender as those of the antelope. 400437|3|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2882|Its motion was exceedingly awkward and indecisive, and we never saw it attempt to run. 400609|4|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2883|We noticed also several animals very similar in appearance, but of a greater length of body, and covered with a black wool. 400695|5|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2884|There were a great variety of tame fowls running about, and these seemed to constitute the chief food of the natives. 400818|6|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2885|To our astonishment we saw black albatross among these birds in a state of entire domestication, going to sea periodically for food, but always returning to the village as a home, and using the southern shore in the vicinity as a place of incubation. 400935|7|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2886|There they were joined by their friends the pelicans as usual, but these latter never followed them to the dwellings of the savages. 401185|8|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2887|Among the other kinds of tame fowls were ducks, differing very little from the canvass-back of our own country, black gannets, and a large bird not unlike the buzzard in appearance, but not carnivorous. 401317|9|250|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2888|As we approached the village with Too-wit and his party, a vast crowd of the people rushed out to meet us, with loud shouts, among which we could only distinguish the everlasting Anamoo-moo! 401519|0|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2889|and Lama-Lama! 401709|1|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2890|These, too, were the tenants of the black skin palaces. 401723|10|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2891|That of Too-wit was situated in the centre of the village, and was much larger and somewhat better constructed than others of its kind. 401778|11|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2892|The tree which formed its support was cut off at a distance of twelve feet or thereabouts from the root, and there were several branches left just below the cut, these serving to extend the covering, and in this way prevent its flapping about the trunk. 401913|12|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2893|The covering, too, which consisted of four very large skins fastened together with wooden skewers, was secured at the bottom with pegs driven through it and into the ground. 402166|13|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2894|The floor was strewed with a quantity of dry leaves by way of carpet. 402339|14|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2895|We were much surprised at perceiving that, with one or two exceptions, these new comers were entirely naked, and skins being used only by the men of the canoes. 402408|2|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2896|All the weapons of the country seemed also to be in the possession of the latter, for there was no appearance of any among the villagers. 402568|3|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2897|There were a great many women and children, the former not altogether wanting in what might be termed personal beauty. 402705|4|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2898|They were straight, tall, and well formed, with a grace and freedom of carriage not to be found in civilized society. 402823|5|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2899|Their lips, however, like those of the men, were thick and clumsy, so that, even when laughing, the teeth were never disclosed. 402940|6|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2900|Their hair was of a finer texture than that of the males. 403067|7|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2901|Among these naked villagers there might have been ten or twelve who were clothed, like the party of Too-wit, in dresses of black skin, and armed with lances and heavy clubs. 403124|8|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2902|These appeared to have great influence among the rest, and were always addressed by the title Wampoo. 403297|9|251|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2903|To this hut we were conducted with great solemnity, and as many of the natives crowded in after us as possible. 403398|0|252|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2904|Too-wit seated himself on the leaves, and made signs that we should follow his example. 403509|1|252|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2905|This we did, and presently found ourselves in a situation peculiarly uncomfortable, if not indeed critical. 403596|2|252|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2906|We were on the ground, twelve in number, with the savages, as many as forty, sitting on their hams so closely around us that, if any disturbance had arisen, we should have found it impossible to make use of our arms, or indeed to have risen to our feet. 403703|3|252|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2907|The pressure was not only inside the tent, but outside, where probably was every individual on the whole island, the crowd being prevented from trampling us to death only by the incessant exertions and vociferations of Too-wit. 403956|4|252|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2908|Our chief security lay, however, in the presence of Too-wit himself among us, and we resolved to stick by him closely, as the best chance of extricating ourselves from the dilemma, sacrificing him immediately upon the first appearance of hostile design. 404183|5|252|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2909|After some trouble a certain degree of quiet was restored, when the chief addressed us in a speech of great length, and very nearly resembling the one delivered in the canoes, with the exception that the Anamoo-moos! 404436|0|253|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2910|were now somewhat more strenuously insisted upon than the Lama-Lamas! 404652|1|253|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2911|We listened in profound silence until the conclusion of this harangue, when Captain Guy replied by assuring the chief of his eternal friendship and goodwill, concluding what he had to say be a present of several strings of blue beads and a knife. 404721|2|253|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2912|At the former the monarch, much to our surprise, turned up his nose with some expression of contempt, but the knife gave him the most unlimited satisfaction, and he immediately ordered dinner. 404967|3|253|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2913|This was handed into the tent over the heads of the attendants, and consisted of the palpitating entrails of a specials of unknown animal, probably one of the slim-legged hogs which we had observed in our approach to the village. 405159|4|253|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2914|Seeing us at a loss how to proceed, he began, by way of setting us an example, to devour yard after yard of the enticing food, until we could positively stand it no longer, and evinced such manifest symptoms of rebellion of stomach as inspired his majesty with a degree of astonishment only inferior to that brought about by the looking-glasses. 405388|5|253|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2915|We declined, however, partaking of the delicacies before us, and endeavoured to make him understand that we had no appetite whatever, having just finished a hearty dejeuner. 405733|6|253|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2916|When the monarch had made an end of his meal, we commenced a series of cross-questioning in every ingenious manner we could devise, with a view of discovering what were the chief productions of the country, and whether any of them might be turned to profit. 405906|0|254|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2917|At length he seemed to have some idea of our meaning, and offered to accompany us to a part of coast where he assured us the biche de mer (pointing to a specimen of that animal) was to be found in great abundance. 406163|1|254|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2918|We were glad of this early opportunity of escaping from the oppression of the crowd, and signified our eagerness to proceed. 406376|2|254|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2919|We now left the tent, and, accompanied by the whole population of the village, followed the chief to the southeastern extremity of the island, nor far from the bay where our vessel lay at anchor. 406500|3|254|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2920|We waited here for about an hour, until the four canoes were brought around by some of the savages to our station. 406695|4|254|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2921|the whole of our party then getting into one of them, we were paddled along the edge of the reef before mentioned, and of another still farther out, where we saw a far greater quantity of biche de mer than the oldest seamen among us had ever seen in those groups of the lower latitudes most celebrated for this article of commerce. 406809|5|254|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2922|We stayed near these reefs only long enough to satisfy ourselves that we could easily load a dozen vessels with the animal if necessary, when we were taken alongside the schooner, and parted with Too-wit, after obtaining from him a promise that he would bring us, in the course of twenty-four hours, as many of the canvass-back ducks and Gallipago tortoises as his canoes would hold. 407140|6|254|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2923|In the whole of this adventure we saw nothing in the demeanour of the natives calculated to create suspicion, with the single exception of the systematic manner in which their party was strengthened during our route from the schooner to the village. 407523|7|254|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2924|The chief was as good as his word, and we were soon plentifully sup. 407772|0|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2925|plied with fresh provisions. 407840|1|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2926|In return for these good things we presented the natives with blue beads, brass trinkets, nails, knives, and pieces of red cloth, they being fully delighted in the exchange. 407868|10|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2927|We established a regular market on shore, just under the guns of the schooner, where our barterings were carried on with every appearance of good faith, and a degree of order which their conduct at the village of Klock-klock had not led us to expect from the savages. 408041|11|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2928|We found the tortoises as fine as we had ever seen, and the ducks surpassed our best species of wild fowl, being exceedingly tender, juicy, and well-flavoured. 408308|2|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2929|Besides these, the savages brought us, upon our making them comprehend our wishes, a vast quantity of brown celery and scurvy grass, with a canoe-load of fresh fish and some dried. 408467|3|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2930|The celery was a treat indeed, and the scurvy grass proved of incalculable benefit in restoring those of our men who had shown symptoms of disease. 408647|4|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2931|In a very short time we had not a single person on the sick-list. 408794|5|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2932|We had also plenty of other kinds of fresh provisions, among which may be mentioned a species of shellfish resembling the mussel in shape, but with the taste of an oyster. 408859|6|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2933|Shrimps, too, and prawns were abundant, and albatross and other birds' eggs with dark shells. 409030|7|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2934|We took in, too, a plentiful stock of the flesh of the hog which I have mentioned before. 409123|8|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2935|Most of the men found it a palpatable food, but I thought it fishy and otherwise disagreeable. 409212|9|255|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2936|Matters went on thus very amicably for several days, during which parties of the natives were frequently on board the schooner, and parties of our men frequently on shore, making long excursions into the interior, and receiving no molestation whatever. 409306|0|256|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2937|Finding the ease with which the vessel might be loaded with biche de mer, owing to the friendly disposition of the islanders, and the readiness with which they would render us assistance in collecting it, Captain Guy resolved to enter into negotiations with Too-wit for the erection of suitable houses in which to cure the article, and for the services of himself and tribe in gathering as much as possible, while he himself took advantage of the fine weather to prosecute his voyage to the southward. 409558|1|256|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2938|Upon mentioning this project to the chief he seemed very willing to enter into an agreement. 410059|2|256|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2939|A bargain was accordingly struck, perfectly satisfactory to both parties, by which it was arranged that, after making the necessary preparations, such as laying off the proper grounds, erecting a portion of the buildings, and doing some other work in which the whole of our crew would be required, the schooner should proceed on her route, leaving three of her men on the island to superintend the fulfilment of the project, and instruct the natives in drying the biche de mer. 410151|3|256|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2940|In regard to terms, these were made to depend upon the exertions of the savages in our absence. 410628|4|256|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2941|They were to receive a stipulated quantity of blue beads, knives, red cloth, and so forth, for every certain number of piculs of the biche de mer which should be ready on our return. 410723|5|256|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2942|A description of the nature of this important article of commerce, and the method of preparing it, may prove of some interest to my readers, and I can find no more suitable place than this for introducing an account of it. 410905|0|257|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2943|The following comprehensive notice of the substance is taken from a modern history of a voyage to the South Seas. 411127|1|257|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2944|"""It is that mollusca from the Indian Seas which is known to commerce by the French name bouche de mer (a nice morsel from the sea). 411240"|0|258|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2945|If I am not much mistaken, the celebrated Cuvier calls it gasteropeda pulmonifera. 411371|1|258|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2946|It is abundantly gathered in the coasts of the Pacific islands, and gathered especially for the Chinese market, where it commands a great price, perhaps as much as their much-talked-of edible birds' nests, which are properly made up of the gelatinous matter picked up by a species of swallow from the body of these molluscae. 411453|2|258|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2947|They have no shell, no legs, nor any prominent part, except an absorbing and an excretory, opposite organs; but, by their elastic wings, like caterpillars or worms, they creep in shallow waters, in which, when low, they can be seen by a kind of swallow, the sharp bill of which, inserted in the soft animal, draws a gummy and filamentous substance, which, by drying, can be wrought into the solid walls of their nest. 411778|3|258|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2948|Hence the name of gasteropeda pulmonifera. 412195|4|258|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2949|"""This mollusca is oblong, and of different sizes, from three to eighteen inches in length; and I have seen a few that were not less than two feet long. 412237"|0|259|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2950|They were nearly round, a little flattish on one side, which lies next to the bottom of the sea; and they are from one to eight inches thick. 412388|1|259|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2951|They crawl up into shallow water at particular seasons of the year, probably for the purpose of gendering, as we often find them in pairs. 412529|2|259|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2952|It is when the sun has the most power on the water, rendering it tepid, that they approach the shore; and they often go up into places so shallow that, on the tide's receding, they are left dry, exposed to the beat of the sun. 412667|3|259|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2953|But they do not bring forth their young in shallow water, as we never see any of their progeny, and full-grown ones are always observed coming in from deep water. 412893|4|259|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2954|They feed principally on that class of zoophytes which produce the coral. 413055|5|259|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2955|I remained three days and nights (as nearly as I could guess) in my hiding-place without getting out of it at all, except twice for the purpose of stretching my limbs by standing erect between two crates just opposite the opening. 413128|0|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2956|During the whole period I saw nothing of Augustus; but this occasioned me little uneasiness, as I knew the brig was expected to put to sea every hour, and in the bustle he would not easily find opportunities of coming down to me. 413358|1|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2957|You will find my watch there–it may be useful to you, as you have no daylight to keep time by. 413587|10|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2958|I suppose you can't tell how long you have been buried–only three days–this is the twentieth. 413681|11|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2960|With this he went up. 413842|13|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2961|At length I heard the trap open and shut. 413863|2|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2962|and presently he called in a low voice, asking if all was well, and if there was any thing I wanted. 413904|3|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2965|"""I came to let you know, and for fear you should be uneasy at my absence. 414148"|6|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2966|I shall not have a chance of coming down again for some time–perhaps for three or four days more. 414221|7|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2967|All is going on right aboveboard. 414318|8|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2968|After I go up and close the trap, do you creep along by the whipcord to where the nail is driven in. 414351|9|26|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2969|"""The biche de mer is generally taken in three or four feet of water; after which they are brought on shore, and split at one end with a knife, the incision being one inch or more, according to the size of the mollusca. 414451"|0|260|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2970|Through this opening the entrails are forced out by pressure, and they are much like those of any other small tenant of the deep. 414669|1|260|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2971|The article is then washed, and afterward boiled to a certain degree, which must not be too much or too little. 414798|2|260|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2972|They are then buried in the ground for four hours, then boiled again for a short time, after which they are dried, either by the fire or the sun. 414909|3|260|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2973|Those cured by the sun are worth the most; but where one picul (133 1/3 lbs. 415054|4|260|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2975|When once properly cured, they can be kept in a dry place for two or three years without any risk; but they should be examined once in every few months, say four times a year, to see if any dampness is likely to affect them. 415192|6|260|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2976|"""The Chinese, as before stated, consider biche de mer a very great luxury, believing that it wonderfully strengthens and nourishes the system, and renews the exhausted system of the immoderate voluptuary. 415416"|0|261|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2977|"The first quality commands a high price in Canton, being worth ninety dollars a picul; the second quality, seventy-five dollars; the third, fifty dollars; the fourth, thirty dollars; the fifth, twenty dollars; the sixth, twelve dollars; the seventh, eight dollars; and the eighth, four dollars; small cargoes, however, will often bring more in Manilla, Singapore, and Batavia"". 415620"|1|261|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2978|An agreement having been thus entered into, we proceeded immediately to land everything necessary for preparing the buildings and clearing the ground. 415997|0|262|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2979|A large flat space near the eastern shore of the bay was selected, where there was plenty of both wood and water, and within a convenient distance of the principal reefs on which the biche de mer was to be procured. 416147|1|262|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2980|We now all set to work in good earnest, and soon, to the great astonishment of the savages, had felled a sufficient number of trees for our purpose, getting them quickly in order for the framework of the houses, which in two or three days were so far under way that we could safely trust the rest of the work to the three men whom we intended to leave behind. 416362|2|262|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2981|These I believe), who volunteered their services in this respect. 416721|3|262|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2982|By the last of the month we had everything in readiness for departure. 416786|0|263|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2983|We had agreed, however, to pay a formal visit of leave-taking to the village, and Too-wit insisted so pertinaciously upon our keeping the promise that we did not think it advisable to run the risk of offending him by a final refusal. 416856|1|263|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2984|I believe that not one of us had at this time the slightest suspicion of the good faith of the savages. 417089|2|263|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2985|They had uniformly behaved with the greatest decorum, aiding us with alacrity in our work, offering us their commodities, frequently without price, and never, in any instance, pilfering a single article, although the high value they set upon the goods we had with us was evident by the extravagant demonstrations of joy always manifested upon our making them a present. 417192|3|263|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2986|The women especially were most obliging in every respect, and, upon the whole, we should have been the most suspicious of human beings had we entertained a single thought of perfidy on the part of a people who treated us so well. 417561|4|263|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2987|A very short while sufficed to prove that this apparent kindness of disposition was only the result of a deeply laid plan for our destruction, and that the islanders for whom we entertained such inordinate feelings of esteem, were among the most barbarous, subtle, and bloodthirsty wretches that ever contaminated the face of the globe. 417790|5|263|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2988|It was on the first of February that we went on shore for the purpose of visiting the village. 418126|0|264|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2989|Although, as said before, we entertained not the slightest suspicion, still no proper precaution was neglected. 418220|1|264|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2990|Six men were left in the schooner, with instructions to permit none of the savages to approach the vessel during our absence, under any pretence whatever, and to remain constantly on deck. 418331|2|264|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2991|The boarding-nettings were up, the guns double-shotted with grape and canister, and the swivels loaded with canisters of musket-balls. 418519|3|264|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2992|She lay, with her anchor apeak, about a mile from the shore, and no canoe could approach her in any direction without being distinctly seen and exposed to the full fire of our swivels immediately. 418653|4|264|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2993|The six men being left on board, our shore-party consisted of thirty. 418849|0|265|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

2995|We were armed to the teeth, having with us muskets, pistols, and cutlasses; besides, each had a long kind of seaman's knife, somewhat resembling the bowie knife now so much used throughout our western and southern country. 418937|2|265|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2996|A hundred of the black skin warriors met us at the landing for the purpose of accompanying us on our way. 419159|3|265|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2997|We noticed, however, with some surprise, that they were now entirely without arms; and, upon questioning Too-wit in relation to this circumstance, he merely answered that Mattee non we pa pa si–meaning that there was no need of arms where all were brothers. 419264|4|265|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2998|We took this in good part, and proceeded. 419521|5|265|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
2999|We had passed the spring and rivulet of which I before spoke, and were now entering upon a narrow gorge leading through the chain of soapstone hills among which the village was situated. 419562|0|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3000|This gorge was very rocky and uneven, so much so that it was with no little difficulty we scrambled through it on our first visit to Klock-klock. 419748|1|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3001|Next came our own party. 419893|10|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3002|We walked closely together, taking care only to prevent separation. 419917|11|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3003|Behind followed the main body of the savages, observing unusual order and decorum. 419984|12|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3004|The whole length of the ravine might have been a mile and a half, or probably two miles. 420066|2|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3005|It wound in every possible direction through the hills (having apparently formed, at some remote period, the bed of a torrent), in no instance proceeding more than twenty yards without an abrupt turn. 420154|3|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3006|The sides of this dell would have averaged, I am sure, seventy or eighty feet in perpendicular altitude throughout the whole of their extent, and in some portions they arose to an astonishing height, overshadowing the pass so completely that but little of the light of day could penetrate. 420354|4|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3007|The general width was about forty feet, and occasionally it diminished so as not to allow the passage of more than five or six persons abreast. 420643|5|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3008|In short, there could be no place in the world better adapted for the consummation of an ambuscade, and it was no more than natural that we should look carefully to our arms as we entered upon it. 420786|6|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3009|When I now think of our egregious folly, the chief subject of astonishment seems to be, that we should have ever ventured, under any circumstances, so completely into the power of unknown savages as to permit them to march both before and behind us in our progress through this ravine. 420982|7|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3010|Yet such was the order we blindly took up, trusting foolishly to the force of our party, the unarmed condition of Too-wit and his men, the certain efficacy of our firearms (whose effect was yet a secret to the natives), and, more than all, to the long-sustained pretension of friendship kept up by these infamous wretches. 421267|8|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3011|Five or six of them went on before, as if to lead the way, ostentatiously busying themselves in removing the larger stones and rubbish from the path. 421589|9|266|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3012|Dirk Peters, a man named Wilson Allan, and myself were on the right of our companions, examining, as we went along, the singular stratification of the precipice which overhung us. 421738|0|267|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3013|A fissure in the soft rock attracted our attention. 421917|1|267|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3014|It was about wide enough for one person to enter without squeezing, and extended back into the hill some eighteen or twenty feet in a straight course, sloping afterward to the left. 421968|2|267|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3015|The height of the opening, is far as we could see into it from the main gorge, was perhaps sixty or seventy feet. 422149|3|267|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3016|There were one or two stunted shrubs growing from the crevices, bearing a species of filbert which I felt some curiosity to examine, and pushed in briskly for that purpose, gathering five or six of the nuts at a grasp, and then hastily retreating. 422262|4|267|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3017|As I turned, I found that Peters and Allan had followed me. 422509|5|267|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3018|I desired them to go back, as there was not room for two persons to pass, saying they should have some of my nuts. 422568|6|267|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3019|They accordingly turned, and were scrambling back, Allan being close to the mouth of the fissure, when I was suddenly aware of a concussion resembling nothing I had ever before experienced, and which impressed me with a vague conception, if indeed I then thought of anything, that the whole foundations of the solid globe were suddenly rent asunder, and that the day of universal dissolution was at hand. 422682|7|267|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3020|As soon as I could collect my scattered senses, I found myself nearly suffocated, and grovelling in utter darkness among a quantity of loose earth, which was also falling upon me heavily in every direction, threatening to bury me entirely. 423086|0|268|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3021|Horribly alarmed at this idea, I struggled to gain my feet, and at last succeeded. 423325|1|268|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3022|I then remained motionless for some moments, endeavouring to conceive what had happened to me, and where I was. 423407|2|268|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3023|Presently I heard a deep groan just at my ear, and afterward the smothered voice of Peters calling to me for aid in the name of God. 423518|3|268|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3024|I scrambled one or two paces forward, when I fell directly over the head and shoulders of my companion, who, I soon discovered, was buried in a loose mass of earth as far as his middle, and struggling desperately to free himself from the pressure. 423650|4|268|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3025|I tore the dirt from around him with all the energy I could command, and at length succeeded in getting him out. 423897|5|268|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3026|As soon as we sufficiently recovered from our fright and surprise to be capable of conversing rationally, we both came to the conclusion that the walls of the fissure in which we had ventured had, by some convulsion of nature, or probably from their own weight, caved in overhead, and that we were consequently lost for ever, being thus entombed alive. 424009|0|269|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3027|For a long time we gave up supinely to the most intense agony and despair, such as cannot be adequately imagined by those who have never been in a similar position. 424361|1|269|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3028|I firmly believed that no incident ever occurring in the course of human events is more adapted to inspire the supremeness of mental and bodily distress than a case like our own, of living inhumation. 424525|2|269|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3029|The blackness of darkness which envelops the victim, the terrific oppression of lungs, the stifling fumes from the damp earth, unite with the ghastly considerations that we are beyond the remotest confines of hope, and that such is the allotted portion of the dead, to carry into the human heart a degree of appalling awe and horror not to be tolerated–never to be conceived. 424725|3|269|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3030|In about an hour after he had gone I distinctly felt the brig in motion, and congratulated myself upon having at length fairly commenced a voyage. 425100|0|27|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3031|Satisfied with this idea, I determined to make my mind as easy as possible, and await the course of events until I should be permitted to exchange the box for the more roomy, although hardly more comfortable, accommodations of the cabin. 425246|1|27|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3032|My first care was to get the watch. 425483|2|27|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3033|Leaving the taper burning, I groped along in the dark, following the cord through windings innumerable, in some of which I discovered that, after toiling a long distance, I was brought back within a foot or two of a former position. 425518|3|27|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3034|At length I reached the nail, and securing the object of my journey, returned with it in safety. 425750|4|27|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3035|I now looked over the books which had been so thoughtfully provided, and selected the expedition of Lewis and Clarke to the mouth of the Columbia. 425846|5|27|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3036|With this I amused myself for some time, when, growing sleepy, I extinguished the light with great care, and soon fell into a sound slumber. 425992|6|27|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3037|At length Peters proposed that we should endeavour to ascertain precisely the extent of our calamity, and grope about our prison; it being barely possible, he observed, that some opening might yet be left us for escape. 426132|0|270|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3038|I caught eagerly at this hope, and, arousing myself to exertion, attempted to force my way through the loose earth. 426351|1|270|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3039|Hardly had I advanced a single step before a glimmer of light became perceptible, enough to convince me that, at all events, we should not immediately perish for want of air. 426466|2|270|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3040|We now took some degree of heart, and encouraged each other to hope for the best. 426640|3|270|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3041|Having scrambled over a bank of rubbish which impeded our farther progress in the direction of the light, we found less difficulty in advancing and also experienced some relief from the excessive oppression of lungs which had tormented us. 426721|4|270|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3042|Presently we were enabled to obtain a glimpse of the objects around, and discovered that we were near the extremity of the straight portion of the fissure, where it made a turn to the left. 426960|5|270|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3043|A few struggles more, and we reached the bend, when to our inexpressible joy, there appeared a long seam or crack extending upward a vast distance, generally at an angle of about forty-five degrees, although sometimes much more precipitous. 427149|6|270|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3044|We could not see through the whole extent of this opening; but, as a good deal of light came down it, we had little doubt of finding at the top of it (if we could by any means reach the top) a clear passage into the open air. 427389|7|270|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3045|I now called to mind that three of us had entered the fissure from the main gorge, and that our companion, Allan, was still missing; we determined at once to retrace our steps and look for him. 427614|0|271|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3046|After a long search, and much danger from the farther caving in of the earth above us, Peters at length cried out to me that he had hold of our companion's foot, and that his whole body was deeply buried beneath the rubbish beyond the possibility of extricating him. 427807|1|271|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3047|I soon found that what he said was too true, and that, of course, life had been long extinct. 428073|2|271|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3048|With sorrowful hearts, therefore, we left the corpse to its fate, and again made our way to the bend. 428166|3|271|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3049|The breadth of the seam was barely sufficient to admit us, and, after one or two ineffectual efforts at getting up, we began once more to despair. 428267|0|272|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3050|I have before said that the chain of hills through which ran the main gorge was composed of a species of soft rock resembling soap. 428413|1|272|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3051|stone. 428544|2|272|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3052|The sides of the cleft we were now attempting to ascend were of the same material, and so excessively slippery, being wet, that we could get but little foothold upon them even in their least precipitous parts; in some places, where the ascent was nearly perpendicular, the difficulty was, of course, much aggravated; and, indeed, for some time we thought insurmountable. 428550|3|272|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3053|We took courage, however, from despair, and what, by dint of cutting steps in the soft stone with our bowie knives, and swinging at the risk of our lives, to small projecting points of a harder species of slaty rock which now and then protruded from the general mass, we at length reached a natural platform, from which was perceptible a patch of blue sky, at the extremity of a thickly-wooded ravine. 428920|4|272|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3054|Looking back now, with somewhat more leisure, at the passage through which we had thus far proceeded, we clearly saw from the appearance of its sides, that it was of late formation, and we concluded that the concussion, whatever it was, which had so unexpectedly overwhelmed us, had also, at the same moment, laid open this path for escape. 429321|5|272|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3055|Being quite exhausted with exertion, and indeed, so weak that we were scarcely able to stand or articulate, Peters now proposed that we should endeavour to bring our companions to the rescue by firing the pistols which still remained in our girdles–the muskets as well as cutlasses had been lost among the loose earth at the bottom of the chasm. 429661|6|272|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3056|Subsequent events proved that, had we fired, we should have sorely repented it, but luckily a half suspicion of foul play had by this time arisen in my mind, and we forbore to let the savages know of our whereabouts. 430006|7|272|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3057|After having reposed for about an hour, we pushed on slowly up the ravine, and had gone no great way before we heard a succession of tremendous yells. 430222|0|273|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3058|At length we reached what might be called the surface of the ground; for our path hitherto, since leaving the platform, had lain beneath an archway of high rock and foliage, at a vast distance overhead. 430372|1|273|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3059|With great caution we stole to a narrow opening, through which we had a clear sight of the surrounding country, when the whole dreadful secret of the concussion broke upon us in one moment and at one view. 430574|2|273|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3060|The spot from which we looked was not far from the summit of the highest peak in the range of the soapstone hills. 430779|0|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3061|The gorge in which our party of thirty-two had entered ran within fifty feet to the left of us. 430893|1|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3062|There can be no doubt that, by the continuous line of stakes, a partial rupture of the soil had been brought about probably to the depth of one or two feet, when by means of a savage pulling at the end of each of the cords (these cords being attached to the tops of the stakes, and extending back from the edge of the cliff), a vast leverage power was obtained, capable of hurling the whole face of the hill, upon a given signal, into the bosom of the abyss below. 430988|10|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3063|The fate of our poor companions was no longer a matter of uncertainty. 431452|11|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3064|We alone had escaped from the tempest of that overwhelming destruction. 431522|12|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3065|We were the only living white men upon the island. 431593|13|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3066|But, for at least one hundred yards, the channel or bed of this gorge was entirely filled up with the chaotic ruins of more than a million tons of earth and stone that had been artificially tumbled within it. 431643|2|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3067|The means by which the vast mass had been precipitated were not more simple than evident, for sure traces of the murderous work were yet remaining. 431851|3|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3068|In several spots along the top of the eastern side of the gorge (we were now on the western) might be seen stakes of wood driven into the earth. 431998|4|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3069|In these spots the earth had not given way, but throughout the whole extent of the face of the precipice from which the mass had fAllan, it was clear, from marks left in the soil resembling those made by the drill of the rock blaster, that stakes similar to those we saw standing had been inserted, at not more than a yard apart, for the length of perhaps three hundred feet, and ranging at about ten feet back from the edge of the gulf. 432142|5|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3070|Strong cords of grape vine were attached to the stakes still remaining on the hill, and it was evident that such cords had also been attached to each of the other stakes. 432579|6|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3071|I have already spoken of the singular stratification of these soapstone hills; and the description just given of the narrow and deep fissure through which we effected our escape from inhumation will afford a further conception of its nature. 432749|7|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3072|This was such that almost every natural convulsion would be sure to split the soil into perpendicular layers or ridges running parallel with one another, and a very moderate exertion of art would be sufficient for effecting the same purpose. 432990|8|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3073|Of this stratification the savages had availed themselves to accomplish their treacherous ends. 433231|9|274|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3074|Our situation, as it now appeared, was scarcely less dreadful than when we had conceived ourselves entombed forever. 433326|0|275|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3075|We saw before us no prospect but that of being put to death by the savages, or of dragging out a miserable existence in captivity among them. 433442|1|275|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3076|We might, to be sure, conceal ourselves for a time from their observation among the fastnesses of the hills, and, as a final resort, in the chasm from which we had just issued; but we must either perish in the long polar winter through cold and famine, or be ultimately discovered in our efforts to obtain relief. 433583|2|275|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3077|The whole country around us seemed to be swarming with savages, crowds of whom, we now perceived, had come over from the islands to the southward on flat rafts, doubtless with a view of lending their aid in the capture and plunder of the Jane. 433896|0|276|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3078|The vessel still lay calmly at anchor in the bay, those on board being apparently quite unconscious of any danger awaiting them. 434139|1|276|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3079|How we longed at that moment to be with them! 434267|2|276|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3080|either to aid in effecting their escape, or to perish with them in attempting a defence. 434312|3|276|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3081|We saw no chance even of warning them of their danger without bringing immediate destruction upon our own heads, with but a remote hope of benefit to them. 434400|4|276|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3082|A pistol fired might suffice to apprise them that something wrong had occurred; but the report could not possibly inform them that their only prospect of safety lay in getting out of the harbour forthwith–nor tell them no principles of honour now bound them to remain, that their companions were no longer among the living. 434555|5|276|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3083|Upon hearing the discharge they could not be more thoroughly prepared to meet the foe, who were now getting ready to attack, than they already were, and always had been. 434878|6|276|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3084|No good, therefore, and infinite harm, would result from our firing, and after mature deliberation, we forbore. 435047|7|276|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3085|Our next thought was to attempt to rush toward the vessel, to seize one of the four canoes which lay at the head of the bay, and endeavour to force a passage on board. 435158|0|277|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3086|But the utter impossibility of succeeding in this desperate task soon became evident. 435325|1|277|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3087|The country, as I said before, was literally swarming with the natives, skulking among the bushes and recesses of the hills, so as not to be observed from the schooner. 435410|2|277|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3088|In our immediate vicinity especially, and blockading the sole path by which we could hope to attain the shore at the proper point were stationed the whole party of the black skin warriors, with Too-wit at their head, and apparently only waiting for some re-enforcement to commence his onset upon the Jane. 435578|3|277|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3089|The canoes, too, which lay at the head of the bay, were manned with savages, unarmed, it is true, but who undoubtedly had arms within reach. 435883|4|277|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3090|We were forced, therefore, however unwillingly, to remain in our place of concealment, mere spectators of the conflict which presently ensued. 436023|5|277|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3091|In about half an hour we saw some sixty or seventy rafts, or flatboats, with outriggers, filled with savages, and coming round the southern bight of the harbor. 436165|0|278|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3092|They appeared to have no arms except short clubs, and stones which lay in the bottom of the rafts. 436325|1|278|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3093|Immediately afterward another detachment, still larger, appeared in an opposite direction, and with similar weapons. 436423|2|278|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3094|The four canoes, too, were now quickly filled with natives, starting up from the bushes at the head of the bay, and put off swiftly to join the other parties. 436539|3|278|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3095|Thus, in less time than I have taken to tell it, and as if by magic, the Jane saw herself surrounded by an immense multitude of desperadoes evidently bent upon capturing her at all hazards. 436697|4|278|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3096|That they would succeed in so doing could not be doubted for an instant. 436886|0|279|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3097|The six men left in the vessel, however resolutely they might engage in her defence, were altogether unequal to the proper management of the guns, or in any manner to sustain a contest at such odds. 436958|1|279|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3098|I could hardly imagine that they would make resistance at all, but in this was deceived; for presently I saw them get springs upon the cable, and bring the vessel's starboard broadside to bear upon the canoes, which by this time were within pistol range, the rafts being nearly a quarter of a mile to windward. 437156|2|279|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3099|Owing to some cause unknown, but most probably to the agitation of our poor friends at seeing themselves in so hopeless a situation, the discharge was an entire failure. 437466|3|279|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3100|Not a canoe was hit or a single savage injured, the shots striking short and ricocheting over their heads. 437635|4|279|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3101|The only effect produced upon them was astonishment at the unexpected report and smoke, which was so excessive that for some moments I almost thought they would abandon their design entirely, and return to the shore. 437741|5|279|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3102|And this they would most likely have done had our men followed up their broadside by a discharge of small arms, in which, as the canoes were now so near at hand, they could not have failed in doing some execution, sufficient, at least, to deter this party from a farther advance, until they could have given the rafts also a broadside. 437957|6|279|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3103|But, in place of this, they left the canoe party to recover from their panic, and, by looking about them, to see that no injury had been sustained, while they flew to the larboard to get ready for the rafts. 438292|7|279|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3104|Upon awakening I felt strangely confused in mind, and some time elapsed before I could bring to recollection all the various circumstances of my situation. 438499|0|28|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3105|By degrees, however, I remembered all. 438654|1|28|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3106|Striking a light, I looked at the watch; but it was run down, and there were, consequently, no means of determining how long I slept. 438692|2|28|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3107|My limbs were greatly cramped, and I was forced to relieve them by standing between the crates. 438825|3|28|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3108|Presently feeling an almost ravenous appetite, I bethought myself of the cold mutton, some of which I had eaten just before going to sleep, and found excellent. 438920|4|28|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3109|What was my astonishment in discovering it to be in a state of absolute putrefaction! 439080|5|28|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3110|This circumstance occasioned me great disquietude; for, connecting it with the disorder of mind I experienced upon awakening, I began to suppose that I must have slept for an inordinately long period of time. 439165|6|28|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3111|The close atmosphere of the hold might have had something to do with this, and might, in the end, be productive of the most serious results. 439373|7|28|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3112|My head ached excessively; I fancied that I drew every breath with difficulty; and, in short, I was oppressed with a multitude of gloomy feelings. 439513|8|28|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3113|Still I could not venture to make any disturbance by opening the trap or otherwise, and, having wound up the watch, contented myself as well as possible. 439659|9|28|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3114|The discharge to larboard produced the most terrible effect. 439812|0|280|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3115|The star and double-headed shot of the large guns cut seven or eight of the rafts completely asunder, and killed, perhaps, thirty or forty of the savages outright, while a hundred of them, at least, were thrown into the water, the most of them dreadfully wounded. 439872|1|280|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3116|The remainder, frightened out of their senses, commenced at once a precipitate retreat, not even waiting to pick up their maimed companions, who were swimming about in every direction, screaming and yelling for aid. 440135|2|280|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3117|This great success, however, came too late for the salvation of our devoted people. 440350|3|280|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3118|The canoe party were already on board the schooner to the number of more than a hundred and fifty, the most of them having succeeded in scrambling up the chains and over the boarding-netting even before the matches had been applied to the larboard guns. 440433|4|280|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3119|Nothing now could withstand their brute rage. 440686|5|280|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3120|Our men were borne down at once, overwhelmed, trodden under foot, and absolutely torn to pieces in an instant. 440731|6|280|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3121|Seeing this, the savages on the rafts got the better of their fears, and came up in shoals to the plunder. 440841|0|281|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3122|In five minutes the Jane was a pitiable scene indeed of havoc and tumultuous outrage. 440947|1|281|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3123|The decks were split open and ripped up; the cordage, sails, and everything movable on deck demolished as if by magic, while, by dint of pushing at the stern, towing with the canoes, and hauling at the sides, as they swam in thousands around the vessel, the wretches finally forced her on shore (the cable having been slipped), and delivered her over to the good offices of Too-wit, who, during the whole of the engagement, had maintained, like a skilful general, his post of security and reconnaissance among the hills, but, now that the victory was completed to his satisfaction, condescended to scamper down with his warriors of the black skin, and become a partaker in the spoils. 441032|2|281|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3124|Too-wit's descent left us at liberty to quit our hiding place and reconnoitre the hill in the vicinity of the chasm. 441716|0|282|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3125|At about fifty yards from the mouth of it we saw a small spring of water, at which we slaked the burning thirst that now consumed us. 441832|1|282|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3126|Not far from the spring we discovered several of the filbert-bushes which I mentioned before. 441965|2|282|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3127|Upon tasting the nuts we found them palatable, and very nearly resembling in flavour the common English filbert. 442058|3|282|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3128|We collected our hats full immediately, deposited them within the ravine, and returned for more. 442170|4|282|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3129|While we were busily employed in gathering these, a rustling in the bushes alarmed us, and we were upon the point of stealing back to our covert, when a large black bird of the bittern species strugglingly and slowly arose above the shrubs. 442266|5|282|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3130|I was so much startled that I could do nothing, but Peters had sufficient presence of mind to run up to it before it could make its escape, and seize it by the neck. 442506|6|282|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3131|Its struggles and screams were tremendous, and we had thoughts of letting it go, lest the noise should alarm some of the savages who might be still lurking in the neighbourhood. 442671|7|282|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3132|A stab with a bowie knife, however, at length brought it to the ground, and we dragged it into the ravine, congratulating ourselves that, at all events, we had thus obtained a supply of food enough to last us for a week. 442848|8|282|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3133|We now went out again to look about us, and ventured a considerable distance down the southern declivity of the hill, but met with nothing else which could serve us for food. 443068|0|283|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3134|We therefore collected a quantity of dry wood and returned, seeing one or two large parties of the natives on their way to the village, laden with the plunder of the vessel, and who, we were apprehensive, might discover us in passing beneath the hill. 443242|1|283|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3135|Our next care was to render our place of concealment as secure as possible, and with this object, we arranged some brushwood over the aperture which I have before spoken of as the one through which we saw the patch of blue sky, on reaching the platform from the interior of the chasm. 443493|0|284|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3136|We left only a very small opening just wide enough to admit of our seeing the, bay, without the risk of being discovered from below. 443777|1|284|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3137|Having done this, we congratulated ourselves upon the security of the position; for we were now completely excluded from observation, as long as we chose to remain within the ravine itself, and not venture out upon the hill, We could perceive no traces of the savages having ever been within this hollow; but, indeed, when we came to reflect upon the probability that the fissure through which we attained it had been only just now created by the fall of the cliff opposite, and that no other way of attaining it could be perceived, we were not so much rejoiced at the thought of being secure from molestation as fearful lest there should be absolutely no means left us for descent. 443909|2|284|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3138|We resolved to explore the summit of the hill thoroughly, when a good opportunity should offer. 444591|3|284|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3139|In the meantime we watched the motions of the savages through our loophole. 444686|4|284|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3140|They had already made a complete wreck of the vessel, and were now preparing to set her on fire. 444761|0|285|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3141|In a little while we saw the smoke ascending in huge volumes from her main hatchway, and, shortly afterward, a dense mass of flame burst up from the forecastle. 444857|1|285|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3142|The rigging, masts and what remained of the sails caught immediately, and the fire spread rapidly along the decks. 445017|2|285|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3143|Still a great many of the savages retained their stations about her, hammering with large stones, axes, and cannon balls at the bolts and other iron and copper work. 445131|3|285|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3144|On the beach, and in canoes and rafts, there were not less, altogether, in the immediate vicinity of the schooner, than ten thousand natives, besides the shoals of them who, laden with booty, were making their way inland and over to the neighbouring islands. 445296|4|285|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3145|We now anticipated a catastrophe, and were not disappointed. 445554|5|285|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3146|First of all there came a smart shock (which we felt as distinctly where we were as if we had been slightly galvanized), but unattended with any visible signs of an explosion. 445614|6|285|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3147|The savages were evidently startled, and paused for an instant from their labours and yellings. 445789|7|285|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3148|They were upon the point of recommencing, when suddenly a mass of smoke puffed up from the decks, resembling a black and heavy thundercloud–then, as if from its bowels, arose a tall stream of vivid fire to the height, apparently, of a quarter of a mile–then there came a sudden circular expansion of the flame–then the whole atmosphere was magically crowded, in a single instant, with a wild chaos of wood, and metal, and human limbs-and, lastly, came the concussion in its fullest fury, which hurled us impetuously from our feet, while the hills echoed and re-echoed the tumult, and a dense shower of the minutest fragments of the ruins tumbled headlong in every direction around us. 445884|8|285|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3149|The havoc among the savages far exceeded our utmost expectation, and they had now, indeed, reaped the full and perfect fruits of their treachery. 446568|0|286|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3150|Perhaps a thousand perished by the explosion, while at least an equal number were desperately mangled. 446713|1|286|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3151|The whole surface of the bay was literally strewn with the struggling and drowning wretches, and on shore matters were even worse. 446815|2|286|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3152|They seemed utterly appalled by the suddenness and completeness of their discomfiture, and made no efforts at assisting one another. 446945|3|286|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3153|At length we observed a total change in their demeanour. 447077|4|286|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3154|"From absolute stupor, they appeared to be, all at once, aroused to the highest pitch of excitement, and rushed wildly about, going to and from a certain point on the beach, with the strangest expressions of mingled horror, rage, and intense curiosity depicted on their countenances, and shouting, at the top of their voices, ""Tekeli-li! 447133"|5|286|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3155|"Tekeli-li""! 447469"|6|286|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3156|Presently we saw a large body go off into the hills, whence they returned in a short time, carrying stakes of wood. 447480|0|287|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3157|These they brought to the station where the crowd was the thickest, which now separated so as to afford us a view of the object of all this excitement. 447595|1|287|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3158|We perceived something white lying upon the ground, but could not immediately make out what it was. 447746|2|287|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3159|At length we saw that it was the carcass of the strange animal with the scarlet teeth and claws which the schooner had picked up at sea on the eighteenth of January. 447845|3|287|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3160|Captain Guy had had the body preserved for the purpose of stuffing the skin and taking it to England. 448010|4|287|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3161|I remember he had given some directions about it just before our making the island, and it had been brought into the cabin and stowed away in one of the lockers. 448111|5|287|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3162|It had now been thrown on shore by the explosion; but why it had occasioned so much concern among the savages was more than we could comprehend. 448272|6|287|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3163|Although they crowded around the carcass at a little distance, none of them seemed willing to approach it closely. 448416|7|287|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3164|"By-and-by the men with the stakes drove them in a circle around it, and no sooner was this arrangement completed, than the whole of the vast assemblage rushed into the interior of the island, with loud screams of ""Tekeli-li! 448530"|8|287|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3165|"Tekeli-li""! 448754"|9|287|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3166|During the six or seven days immediately following we remained in our hiding-place upon the hill, going out only occasionally, and then with the greatest precaution, for water and filberts. 448765|0|288|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3167|We had made a kind of penthouse on the platform, furnishing it with a bed of dry leaves, and placing in it three large flat stones, which served us for both fireplace and table. 448954|1|288|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3168|We kindled a fire without difficulty by rubbing two pieces of dry wood together, the one soft, the other hard. 449131|2|288|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3169|The bird we had taken in such good season proved excellent eating, although somewhat tough. 449241|3|288|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3170|It was not an oceanic fowl, but a species of bittern, with jet black and grizzly plumage, and diminutive wings in proportion to its bulk. 449332|4|288|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3171|We afterward saw three of the same kind in the vicinity of the ravine, apparently seeking for the one we had captured; but, as they never alighted, we had no opportunity of catching them. 449469|5|288|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3172|As long as this fowl lasted we suffered nothing from our situation, but it was now entirely consumed, and it became absolutely necessary that we should look out for provision. 449656|0|289|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3173|The filberts would not satisfy the cravings of hunger, afflicting us, too, with severe gripings of the bowels, and, if freely indulged in, with violent headache. 449831|1|289|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3174|We had seen several large tortoises near the seashore to the eastward of the hill, and perceived they might be easily taken, if we could get at them without the observation of the natives. 449992|2|289|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3175|It was resolved, therefore, to make an attempt at descending. 450180|3|289|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3176|Throughout the whole of the next tedious twenty-four hours no person came to my relief, and I could not help accusing Augustus of the grossest inattention. 450241|0|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3177|What alarmed me chiefly was, that the water in my jug was reduced to about half a pint, and I was suffering much from thirst, having eaten freely of the Bologna sausages after the loss of my mutton. 450396|1|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3178|Besides, granting that we were still in the neighborhood of the island, why should not Augustus have visited me and informed me of the circumstance? 450594|10|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3179|Pondering in this manner upon the difficulties of my solitary and cheerless condition, I resolved to wait yet another twenty-four hours, when, if no relief were obtained, I would make my way to the trap, and endeavour either to hold a parley with my friend, or get at least a little fresh air through the opening, and a further supply of water from the stateroom. 450742|11|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3180|While occupied with this thought, however, I fell in spite of every exertion to the contrary, into a state of profound sleep, or rather stupor. 451105|12|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3181|My dreams were of the most terrific description. 451248|13|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3182|Every species of calamity and horror befell me. 451296|14|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3183|Among other miseries I was smothered to death between huge pillows, by demons of the most ghastly and ferocious aspect. 451343|15|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3184|Immense serpents held me in their embrace, and looked earnestly in my face with their fearfully shining eyes. 451462|16|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3185|Then deserts, limitless, and of the most forlorn and awe-inspiring character, spread themselves out before me. 451571|17|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3186|Immensely tall trunks of trees, gray and leafless, rose up in endless succession as far as the eye could reach. 451681|18|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3187|Their roots were concealed in wide-spreading morasses, whose dreary water lay intensely black, still, and altogether terrible, beneath. 451792|19|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3188|I became very uneasy, and could no longer take any interest in my books. 451927|2|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3189|And the strange trees seemed endowed with a human vitality, and waving to and fro their skeleton arms, were crying to the silent waters for mercy, in the shrill and piercing accents of the most acute agony and despair. 451999|20|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3190|The scene changed; and I stood, naked and alone, amidst the burning sand-plains of Sahara. 452217|21|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3191|At my feet lay crouched a fierce lion of the tropics. 452307|22|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3192|Suddenly his wild eyes opened and fell upon me. 452360|23|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3193|With a conculsive bound he sprang to his feet, and laid bare his horrible teeth. 452407|24|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3194|In another instant there burst from his red throat a roar like the thunder of the firmament, and I fell impetuously to the earth. 452487|25|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3195|Stifling in a paroxysm of terror, I at last found myself partially awake. 452616|26|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3196|My dream, then, was not all a dream. 452689|27|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3197|Now, at least, I was in possession of my senses. 452725|28|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3198|The paws of some huge and real monster were pressing heavily upon my bosom–his hot breath was in my ear–and his white and ghastly fangs were gleaming upon me through the gloom. 452773|29|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3199|I was overpowered, too, with a desire to sleep, yet trembled at the thought of indulging it, lest there might exist some pernicious influence, like that of burning charcoal, in the confined air of the hold. 452949|3|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3200|In the meantime the roll of the brig told me that we were far in the main ocean, and a dull humming sound, which reached my ears as if from an immense distance, convinced me no ordinary gale was blowing. 453155|4|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3201|I could not imagine a reason for the absence of Augustus. 453358|5|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3202|We were surely far enough advanced on our voyage to allow of my going up. 453415|6|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3203|Some accident might have happened to him–but I could think of none which would account for his suffering me to remain so long a prisoner, except, indeed, his having suddenly died or fAllan overboard, and upon this idea I could not dwell with any degree of patience. 453488|7|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3204|It was possible that we had been baffled by head winds, and were still in the near vicinity of Nantucket. 453753|8|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3205|This notion, however, I was forced to abandon; for such being the case, the brig must have frequently gone about; and I was entirely satisfied, from her continual inclination to the larboard, that she had been sailing all along with a steady breeze on her starboard quarter. 453858|9|29|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3206|We commenced by going down the southern declivity, which seemed to offer the fewest difficulties, but had not proceeded a hundred yards before (as we had anticipated from appearances on the hilltop) our progress was entirely arrested by a branch of the gorge in which our companions had perished. 454132|0|290|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3207|We now passed along the edge of this for about a quarter of a mile, when we were again stopped by a precipice of immense depth, and, not being able to make our way along the brink of it, we were forced to retrace our steps by the main ravine. 454428|1|290|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3208|We now pushed over to the eastward, but with precisely similar fortune. 454670|0|291|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3209|After an hour's scramble, at the risk of breaking our necks, we discovered that we had merely descended into a vast pit of black granite, with fine dust at the bottom, and whence the only egress was by the rugged path in which we had come down. 454741|1|291|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3210|Toiling again up this path, we now tried the northern edge of the hill. 454985|2|291|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3211|Here we were obliged to use the greatest possible caution in our manoeuvres, as the least indiscretion would expose us to the full view of the savages in the village. 455056|3|291|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3212|We crawled along, therefore, on our hands and knees, and, occasionally, were even forced to throw ourselves at full length, dragging our bodies along by means of the shrubbery. 455222|4|291|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3213|In this careful manner we had proceeded but a little way, when we arrived at a chasm far deeper than any we had yet seen, and leading directly into the main gorge. 455398|5|291|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3214|Thus our fears were fully confirmed, and we found ourselves cut off entirely from access to the world below. 455561|6|291|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3215|Thoroughly exhausted by our exertions, we made the best of our way back to the platform, and throwing ourselves upon the bed of leaves, slept sweetly and soundly for some hours. 455669|7|291|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3216|For several days after this fruitless search we were occupied in exploring every part of the summit of the hill, in order to inform ourselves of its actual resources. 455846|0|292|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3217|We found that it would afford us no food, with the exception of the unwholesome filberts, and a rank species of scurvy grass, which grew in a little patch of not more than four rods square, and would be soon exhausted. 456012|1|292|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3218|On the fifteenth of February, as near as I can remember, there was not a blade of this left, and the nuts were growing scarce; our situation, therefore, could hardly be more lamentable. 456230|2|292|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3219|* On the sixteenth we again went round the walls of our prison, in hope of finding some avenue of escape; but to no purpose. 456415|3|292|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3220|We also descended the chasm in which we had been overwhelmed, with the faint expectation of discovering, through this channel, some opening to the main ravine. 456539|4|292|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3221|Here, too, we were disappointed, although we found and brought up with us a musket. 456698|5|292|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3222|* This day was rendered remarkable by our observing in the south several huge wreaths of the grayish vapour I have spoken of. 456781|0|293|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3223|On the seventeenth we set out with the determination of examining more thoroughly the chasm of black granite into which we had made our way in the first search. 456906|0|294|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3224|We remembered that one of the fissures in the sides of this pit had been but partially looked into, and we were anxious to explore it, although with no expectation of discovering here any opening. 457066|1|294|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3225|We found no great difficulty in reaching the bottom of the hollow as before, and were now sufficiently calm to survey it with some attention. 457262|0|295|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3226|It was, indeed, one of the most singular-looking places imaginable, and we could scarcely bring ourselves to believe it altogether the work of nature. 457403|1|295|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3227|The pit, from its eastern to its western extremity, was about five hundred yards in length, when all its windings were threaded; the distance from east to west in a straight line not being more (I should suppose, having no means of accurate examination) than forty or fifty yards. 457553|2|295|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3228|Upon first descending into the chasm, that is to say, for a hundred feet downward from the summit of the hill, the sides of the abyss bore little resemblance to each other, and, apparently, had at no time been connected, the one surface being of the soapstone, and the other of marl, granulated with some metallic matter. 457833|3|295|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3229|The average breadth or interval between the two cliffs was probably here sixty feet, but there seemed to be no regularity of formation. 458154|4|295|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3230|Passing down, however, beyond the limit spoken of, the interval rapidly contracted, and the sides began to run parallel, although, for some distance farther, they were still dissimilar in their material and form of surface. 458289|5|295|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3231|Upon arriving within fifty feet of the bottom, a perfect regularity commenced. 458512|6|295|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3232|The sides were now entirely uniform in substance, in colour, and in lateral direction, the material being a very black and shining granite, and the distance between the two sides, at all points facing each other, exactly twenty yards. 458590|7|295|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3233|The precise formation of the chasm will be best understood by means of a delineation taken upon the spot; for I had luckily with me a pocketbook and pencil, which I preserved with great care through a long series of subsequent adventure, and to which I am indebted for memoranda of many subjects which would otherwise have been crowded from my remembrance. 458824|8|295|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3237|The bottom of the gulf was covered to the depth of three or four inches with a powder almost impalpable, beneath which we found a continuation of the black granite. 459374|2|296|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3238|To the right, at the lower extremity, will be noticed the appearance of a small opening; this is the fissure alluded to above, and to examine which more minutely than before was the object of our second visit. 459538|3|296|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3239|We now pushed into it with vigor, cutting away a quantity of brambles which impeded us, and removing a vast heap of sharp flints somewhat resembling arrowheads in shape. 459747|4|296|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3240|We were encouraged to persevere, however, by perceiving some little light proceeding from the farther end. 459916|5|296|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3241|We at length squeezed our way for about thirty feet, and found that the aperture was a low and regularly formed arch, having a bottom of the same impalpable powder as that in the main chasm. 460022|6|296|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3242|A strong light now broke upon us, and, turning a short bend, we found ourselves in another lofty chamber, similar to the one we had left in every respect but longitudinal form. 460212|7|296|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3243|Its general figure is here given. 460388|8|296|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3245|The total length of this chasm, commencing at the opening a and proceeding round the curve b to the extremity d, is five hundred and fifty yards. 460430|0|297|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3246|At c we discovered a small aperture similar to the one through which we had issued from the other chasm, and this was choked up in the same manner with brambles and a quantity of the white arrowhead flints. 460575|1|297|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3247|We forced our way through it, finding it about forty feet long, and emerged into a third chasm. 460781|2|297|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3248|This, too, was precisely like the first, except in its longitudinal shape, which was thus. 460876|3|297|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3251|We found the entire length of the third chasm three hundred and twenty yards. 460977|0|298|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3252|At the point a was an opening about six feet wide, and extending fifteen feet into the rock, where it terminated in a bed of marl, there being no other chasm beyond, as we had expected. 461054|1|298|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3253|We were about leaving this fissure, into which very little light was admitted, when Peters called my attention to a range of singular-looking indentures in the surface of the marl forming the termination of the cul-de-sac. 461239|2|298|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3254|With a very slight exertion of the imagination, the left, or most northern of these indentures might have been taken for the intentional, although rude, representation of a human figure standing erect, with outstretched arm. 461461|3|298|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3255|The rest of them bore also some little resemblance to alphabetical characters, and Peters was willing, at all events, to adopt the idle opinion that they were really such. 461685|4|298|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3256|I convinced him of his error, finally, by directing his attention to the floor of the fissure, where, among the powder, we picked up, piece by piece, several large flakes of the marl, which had evidently been broken off by some convulsion from the surface where the indentures were found, and which had projecting points exactly fitting the indentures; thus proving them to have been the work of nature. 461856|5|298|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3259|After satisfying ourselves that these singular caverns afforded us no means of escape from our prison, we made our way back, dejected and dispirited, to the summit of the hill. 462304|0|299|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3260|Nothing worth mentioning occurred during the next twenty-four hours, except that, in examining the ground to the eastward of the third chasm, we found two triangular holes of great depth, and also with black granite sides. 462480|1|299|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3261|Into these holes we did not think it worth while to attempt descending, as they had the appearance of mere natural wells, without outlet. 462702|2|299|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3262|They were each about twenty yards in circumference, and their shape, as well as relative position in regard to the third chasm, is shown in figure 5. 462839|3|299|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3263|The manner in which this ruse was received has induced me at length to undertake a regular compilation and publication of the adventures in question; for I found that, in spite of the air of fable which had been so ingeniously thrown around that portion of my statement which appeared in the Messenger (without altering or distorting a single fact), the public were still not at all disposed to receive it as fable, and several letters were sent to Mr. P.'s address, distinctly expressing a conviction to the contrary. 462988|0|3|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3264|I thence concluded that the facts of my narrative would prove of such a nature as to carry with them sufficient evidence of their own authenticity, and that I had consequently little to fear on the score of popular incredulity. 463506|1|3|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3266|The beast, whatever it was, retained his position without attempting any immediate violence, while I lay in an utterly helpless, and, I fancied, a dying condition beneath him. 463859|1|30|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3267|I rose hurriedly from the mattress upon which I had been lying, and, throwing myself upon the neck of my faithful follower and friend, relieved the long oppression of my bosom in a flood of the most passionate tears. 464034|10|30|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3268|I felt that my powers of body and mind were fast leaving me–in a word, that I was perishing, and perishing of sheer fright. 464250|2|30|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3269|My brain swam–I grew deadly sick–my vision failed–even the glaring eyeballs above me grew dim. 464373|3|30|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3270|Making a last strong effort, I at length breathed a faint ejaculation to God, and resigned myself to die. 464467|4|30|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3271|The sound of my voice seemed to arouse all the latent fury of the animal. 464572|5|30|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3272|He precipitated himself at full length upon my body; but what was my astonishment, when, with a long and low whine, he commenced licking my face and hands with the greatest eagerness, and with the most extravagant demonstration of affection and joy! 464645|6|30|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3273|I was bewildered, utterly lost in amazement–but I could not forget the peculiar whine of my Newfoundland dog Tiger, and the odd manner of his caresses I well knew. 464894|7|30|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3274|It was he. 465057|8|30|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3275|I experienced a sudden rush of blood to my temples–a giddy and overpowering sense of deliverance and reanimation. 465067|9|30|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3276|On the twentieth of the month, finding it altogether impossible to subsist any longer upon the filberts, the use of which occasioned us the most excruciating torment, we resolved to make a desperate attempt at descending the southern declivity of the hill. 465180|0|300|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3277|The face of the precipice was here of the softest species of soapstone, although nearly perpendicular throughout its whole extent (a depth of a hundred and fifty feet at the least), and in many places even overarching. 465436|1|300|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3278|After long search we discovered a narrow ledge about twenty feet below the brink of the gulf; upon this Peters contrived to leap, with what assistance I could render him by means of our pocket-handkerchiefs tied together. 465654|2|300|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3279|With somewhat more difficulty I also got down; and we then saw the possibility of descending the whole way by the process in which we had clambered up from the chasm when we had been buried by the fall of the hill–that is, by cutting steps in the face of the soapstone with our knives. 465875|3|300|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3280|The extreme hazard of the attempt can scarcely be conceived; but, as there was no other resource, we determined to undertake it. 466160|4|300|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3281|Upon the ledge where we stood there grew some filbert bushes; and to one of these we made fast an end of our rope of handkerchiefs. 466288|0|301|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3282|The other end being tied round Peters' waist, I lowered him down over the edge of the precipice until the handkerchiefs were stretched tight. 466419|1|301|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3283|By these means (means which I should never have conceived of myself, and for which we were indebted altogether to Peters' ingenuity and resolution) my companion finally succeeded, with the occasional aid of projections in the cliff, in reaching the bottom without accident. 466560|10|301|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3284|He now proceeded to dig a deep hole in the soapstone (as far in as eight or ten inches), sloping away the rock above to the height of a foot, or thereabout, so as to allow of his driving, with the butt of a pistol, a tolerably strong peg into the levelled surface. 466833|2|301|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3285|I then drew him up for about four feet when he made a hole similar to the one below, driving in a peg as before and having thus a resting place for both feet and hands. 467097|3|301|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3286|I now unfastened the handkerchiefs from the bush, throwing him the end, which he tied to the peg in the uppermost hole, letting himself down gently to a station about three feet lower than he had yet been–that is, to the full extent of the handkerchiefs. 467265|4|301|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3287|Here he dug another hole, and drove another peg. 467519|5|301|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3288|He then drew himself up, so as to rest his feet in the hole just cut, taking hold with his hands upon the peg in the one above. 467567|6|301|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3289|It was now necessary to untie the handkerchiefs from the topmost peg, with the view of fastening them to the second; and here he found that an error had been committed in cutting the holes at so great a distance apart. 467694|7|301|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3290|However, after one or two unsuccessful and dangerous attempts at reaching the knot (having to hold on with his left hand while he laboured to undo the fastening with his right), he at length cut the string, leaving six inches of it affixed to the peg. 467912|8|301|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3291|Tying the handkerchiefs now to the second peg, he descended to a station below the third, taking care not to go too far down. 468163|9|301|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3292|It was some time before I could summon sufficient resolution to follow him; but I did at length attempt it. 468288|0|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3293|Peters had taken off his shirt before descending, and this, with my own, formed the rope necessary for the adventure. 468395|1|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3294|And now I was consumed with the irrepressible desire of looking below. 468512|10|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3295|I could not, I would not, confine my glances to the cliff; and, with a wild, indefinable emotion, half of horror, half of a relieved oppression, I threw my vision far down into the abyss. 468582|11|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3296|For one moment my fingers clutched convulsively upon their hold, while, with the movement, the faintest possible idea of ultimate escape wandered, like a shadow, through my mind–in the next my whole soul was pervaded with a longing to fall; a desire, a yearning, a passion utterly uncontrollable. 468769|12|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3297|I let go at once my grasp upon the and, turning half round from the precipice, remained tottering for an instant against its naked face. 469065|13|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3298|But now there came a spinning of the brain; a shrill-sounding and phantom voice screamed within my ears; a dusky, fiendish, and filmy figure stood immediately beneath me; and, sighing, I sunk down with a bursting heart, and plunged within its arms. 469201|14|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3299|After throwing down the musket found in the chasm, I fastened this rope to the bushes, and let myself down rapidly, striving, by the vigour of my movements, to banish the trepidation which I could overcome in no other manner. 469449|2|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3300|This answered sufficiently well for the first four or five steps; but presently I found my imagination growing terribly excited by thoughts of the vast depths yet to be descended, and the precarious nature of the pegs and soapstone holes which were my only support. 469674|3|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3301|It was in vain I endeavoured to banish these reflections, and to keep my eyes steadily bent upon the flat surface of the cliff before me. 469939|4|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3302|The more earnestly I struggled not to think, the more intensely vivid became my conceptions, and the more horribly distinct. 470076|5|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3303|At length arrived that crisis of fancy, so fearful in all similar cases, the crisis in which we begin to anticipate the feelings with which we shall fall- to picture to ourselves the sickness, and dizziness, and the last struggle, and the half swoon, and the final bitterness of the rushing and headlong descent. 470200|6|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3304|And now I found these fancies creating their own realities, and all imagined horrors crowding upon me in fact. 470512|7|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3305|I felt my knees strike violently together, while my fingers were gradually but certainly relaxing their grasp. 470622|8|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3306|"There was a ringing in my ears, and I said, ""This is my knell of death""! 470732"|9|302|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3307|I had swooned, and Peters had caught me as I fell. 470804|0|303|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3308|He had observed my proceedings from his station at the bottom of the cliff; and perceiving my imminent danger, had endeavoured to inspire me with courage by every suggestion he could devise; although my confusion of mind had been so great as to prevent my hearing what he said, or being conscious that he had even spoken to me at all. 470854|1|303|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3309|At length, seeing me totter, he hastened to ascend to my rescue, and arrived just in time for my preservation. 471188|2|303|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3310|Had I fAllan with my full weight, the rope of linen would inevitably have snapped, and I should have been precipitated into the abyss; as it was, he contrived to let me down gently, so as to remain suspended without danger until animation returned. 471298|3|303|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3311|This was in about fifteen minutes. 471546|4|303|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3312|On recovery, my trepidation had entirely vanished; I felt a new being, and, with some little further aid from my companion, reached the bottom also in safety. 471580|5|303|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3313|We now found ourselves not far from the ravine which had proved the tomb of our friends, and to the southward of the spot where the hill had fAllan. 471738|0|304|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3314|The place was one of singular wildness, and its aspect brought to my mind the descriptions given by travellers of those dreary regions marking the site of degraded Babylon. 471886|1|304|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3315|Not to speak of the ruins of the disrupted cliff, which formed a chaotic barrier in the vista to the northward, the surface of the ground in every other direction was strewn with huge tumuli, apparently the wreck of some gigantic structures of art; although, in detail, no semblance of art could be detected. 472058|2|304|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3316|Scoria were abundant, and large shapeless blocks of the black granite, intermingled with others of marl,* and both granulated with metal. 472366|3|304|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3317|Of vegetation there were no traces whatsoever throughout the whole of the desolate area within sight. 472503|4|304|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3318|Several immense scorpions were seen, and various reptiles not elsewhere to be found in the high latitudes. 472604|5|304|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3319|* The marl was also black; indeed, we noticed no light-coloured substances of any kind upon the island. 472710|0|305|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3320|As food was our most immediate object, we resolved to make our way to the seacoast, distant not more than half a mile, with a view of catching turtle, several of which we had observed from our place of concealment on the hill. 472813|0|306|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3321|We had proceeded some hundred yards, threading our route cautiously between the huge rocks and tumuli, when, upon turning a corner, five savages sprung upon us from a small cavern, felling Peters to the ground with a blow from a club. 473039|1|306|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3322|As he fell the whole party rushed upon him to secure their victim, leaving me time to recover from my astonishment. 473273|2|306|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3323|I still had the musket, but the barrel had received so much injury in being thrown from the precipice that I cast it aside as useless, preferring to trust my pistols, which had been carefully preserved in order. 473388|3|306|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3324|With these I advanced upon the assailants, firing one after the other in quick succession. 473599|4|306|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3325|Two savages fell, and one, who was in the act of thrusting a spear into Peters, sprung to his feet without accomplishing his purpose. 473689|5|306|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3326|My companion being thus released, we had no further difficulty. 473822|6|306|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3327|He had his pistols also, but prudently declined using them, confiding in his great personal strength, which far exceeded that of any person I have ever known. 473885|7|306|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3328|Seizing a club from one of the savages who had fAllan, he dashed out the brains of the three who remained, killing each instantaneously with a single blow of the weapon, and leaving us completely masters of the field. 474043|8|306|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3329|So rapidly had these events passed, that we could scarcely believe in their reality, and were standing over the bodies of the dead in a species of stupid contemplation, when we were brought to recollection by the sound of shouts in the distance. 474260|0|307|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3330|It was clear that the savages had been alarmed by the firing, and that we had little chance of avoiding discovery. 474505|1|307|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3331|To regain the cliff, it would be necessary to proceed in the direction of the shouts; and even should we succeed in arriving at its base, we should never be able to ascend it without being seen. 474619|2|307|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3332|Our situation was one of the greatest peril, and we were hesitating in which path to commence a flight, when one of the savages whom I had shot, and supposed dead, sprang briskly to his feet, and attempted to make his escape. 474813|3|307|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3333|We overtook him, however, before he had advanced many paces, and were about to put him to death, when Peters suggested that we might derive some benefit from forcing him to accompany us in our attempt to escape. 475038|4|307|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3334|We therefore dragged him with us, making him understand that we would shoot him if he offered resistance. 475249|5|307|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3335|In a few minutes he was perfectly submissive, and ran by our sides as we pushed in among the rocks, making for the seashore. 475354|6|307|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3336|So far, the irregularities of the ground we had been traversing hid the sea, except at intervals, from our sight, and, when we first had it fairly in view, it was perhaps, two hundred yards distant. 475478|0|308|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3337|As we emerged into the open beach we saw, to our great dismay, an immense crowd of the natives pouring from the village, and from all visible quarters of the island, making toward us with gesticulations of extreme fury, and howling like wild beasts. 475676|1|308|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3338|We were upon the point of turning upon our steps, and trying to secure a retreat among the fastnesses of the rougher ground, when I discovered the bows of two canoes projecting from behind a large rock which ran out into the water. 475925|2|308|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3339|Toward these we now ran with all speed, and, reaching them, found them unguarded, and without any other freight than three of the large Gallipago turtles and the usual supply of paddles for sixty rowers. 476156|3|308|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3340|We instantly took possession of one of them, and, forcing our captive on board, pushed out to sea with an the strength we could command. 476359|4|308|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3341|We had not made, however, more than fifty yards from the shore before we became sufficiently calm to perceive the great oversight of which we had been guilty in leaving the other canoe in the power of the savages, who, by this time, were not more than twice as far from the beach as ourselves, and were rapidly advancing to the pursuit. 476495|0|309|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3342|No time was now to be lost. 476831|1|309|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3343|Our hope was, at best, a forlorn one, but we had none other. 476858|2|309|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3344|It was very doubtful whether, with the utmost exertion, we could get back in time to anticipate them in taking possession of the canoe; but yet there was a chance that we could. 476918|3|309|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3345|We might save ourselves if we succeeded, while not to make the attempt was to resign ourselves to inevitable butchery. 477095|4|309|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3346|As upon a former occasion my conceptions were in a state of the greatest indistinctness and confusion after leaving the mattress. 477213|0|31|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3347|For a long time I found it nearly impossible to connect any ideas; but, by very slow degrees, my thinking faculties returned, and I again called to memory the several incidents of my condition. 477342|1|31|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3348|For the presence of Tiger I tried in vain to account; and after busying myself with a thousand different conjectures respecting him, was forced to content myself with rejoicing that he was with me to share my dreary solitude, and render me comfort by his caresses. 477535|2|31|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3349|Most people love their dogs, but for Tiger I had an affection far more ardent than common; and never, certainly, did any creature more truly deserve it. 477799|3|31|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3350|For seven years he had been my inseparable companion, and in a multitude of instances had given evidence of all the noble qualities for which we value the animal. 477951|4|31|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3351|I had rescued him, when a puppy, from the clutches of a malignant little villain in Nantucket who was leading him, with a rope around his neck, to the water; and the grown dog repaid the obligation, about three years afterward, by saving me from the bludgeon of a street robber. 478113|5|31|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3352|The canoe was modelled with the bow and stern alike, and, in place of turning it round, we merely changed our position in paddling. 478391|0|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3353|As soon as the savages perceived this they redoubled their yells, as well as their speed, and approached with inconceivable rapidity. 478522|1|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3354|In truth, from every thing I could see of these wretches, they appeared to be the most wicked, hypocritical, vindictive, bloodthirsty, and altogether fiendish race of men upon the face of the globe. 478655|10|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3355|It is clear we should have had no mercy had we fAllan into their hands. 478853|11|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3356|They made a mad attempt at following us in the fractured canoe, but, finding it useless, again vented their rage in a series of hideous vociferations, and rushed up into the hills. 478924|12|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3357|We pulled, however, with all the energy of desperation, and arrived at the contested point before more than one of the natives had attained it. 479104|2|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3358|This man paid dearly for his superior agility, Peters shooting him through the head with a pistol as he approached the shore. 479247|3|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3359|The foremost among the rest of his party were probably some twenty or thirty paces distant as we seized upon the canoe. 479372|4|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3360|We at first endeavoured to pull her into the deep water, beyond the reach of the savages, but, finding her too firmly aground, and there being no time to spare, Peters, with one or two heavy strokes from the butt of the musket, succeeded in dashing out a large portion of the bow and of one side. 479491|5|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3361|We then pushed off. 479787|6|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3362|Two of the natives by this time had got hold of our boat, obstinately refusing to let go, until we were forced to despatch them with our knives. 479806|7|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3363|We were now clear off, and making great way out to sea. 479950|8|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3364|The main body of the savages, upon reaching the broken canoe, set up the most tremendous yell of rage and disappointment conceivable. 480005|9|310|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3365|We were thus relieved from immediate danger, but our situation was still sufficiently gloomy. 480138|0|311|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3366|We knew that four canoes of the kind we had were at one time in the possession of the savages, and were not aware of the fact (afterward ascertained from our captive) that two of these had been blown to pieces in the explosion of the Jane Guy. 480231|1|311|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3367|We calculated, therefore, upon being yet pursued, as soon as our enemies could get round to the bay (distant about three miles) where the boats were usually laid up. 480474|2|311|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3368|Fearing this, we made every exertion to leave the island behind us, and went rapidly through the water, forcing the prisoner to take a paddle. 480639|3|311|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3369|In about half an hour, when we had gained, probably, five or six miles to the southward, a large fleet of the flat-bottomed canoes or rafts were seen to emerge from the bay evidently with the design of pursuit. 480781|4|311|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3370|Presently they put back, despairing to overtake us. 480991|5|311|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3371|We now found ourselves in the wide and desolate Antarctic Ocean, in a latitude exceeding eighty-four degrees, in a frail canoe, and with no provision but the three turtles. 481042|0|313|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3372|The long polar winter, too, could not be considered as far distant, and it became necessary that we should deliberate well upon the course to be pursued. 481214|1|313|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3373|There were six or seven islands in sight belonging to the same group, and distant from each other about five or six leagues; but upon neither of these had we any intention to venture. 481367|2|313|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3374|In coming from the northward in the Jane Guy we had been gradually leaving behind us the severest regions of ice–this, however little it may be in accordance with the generally received notions respecting the Antarctic, was a fact experience would not permit us to deny. 481550|3|313|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3375|To attempt, therefore, getting back would be folly–especially at so late a period of the season. 481820|4|313|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3376|Only one course seemed to be left open for hope. 481916|5|313|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3377|We resolved to steer boldly to the southward, where there was at least a probability of discovering lands, and more than a probability of finding a still milder climate. 481964|6|313|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3378|So far we had found the Antarctic, like the Arctic Ocean, peculiarly free from violent storms or immoderately rough water, but our canoe was, at best, of frail structure, although large, and we set busily to work with a view of rendering her as safe as the limited means in our possession would admit. 482133|0|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3379|The body of the boat was of no better material than bark–the bark of a tree unknown. 482434|1|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3380|The sight of the linen seemed to affect him in a very singular manner. 482518|10|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3381|"He could not be prevailed upon to touch it or go near it, shuddering when we attempted to force him, and shrieking out, ""Tekeli-li""! 482588"|11|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3382|The ribs were of a tough osier, well adapted to the purpose for which it was used. 482720|2|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3383|We had fifty feet room from stern to stern, from four to six in breadth, and in depth throughout four feet and a half–the boats thus differing vastly in shape from those of any other inhabitants of the Southern Ocean with whom civilized nations are acquainted. 482802|3|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3384|We never did believe them the workmanship of the ignorant islanders who owned them; and some days after this period discovered, by questioning our captive, that they were in fact made by the natives of a group to the southwest of the country where we found them, having fAllan accidentally into the hands of our barbarians. 483062|4|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3385|What we could do for the security of our boat was very little indeed. 483385|5|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3386|Several wide rents were discovered near both ends, and these we contrived to patch up with pieces of woollen jacket. 483454|6|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3387|With the help of the superfluous paddles, of which there were a great many, we erected a kind of framework about the bow, so as to break the force of any seas which might threaten to fill us in that quarter. 483570|7|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3388|We also set up two paddle blades for masts, placing them opposite each other, one by each gunwale, thus saving the necessity of a yard. 483777|8|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3389|To these masts we attached a sail made of our shirts–doing this with some difficulty, as here we could get no assistance from our prisoner whatever, although he had been willing enough to labour in all the other operations. 483912|9|314|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3390|Having completed our arrangements in regard to the security of the canoe, we now set sail to the south southeast for the present, with the view of weathering the most southerly of the group in sight. 484135|0|315|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3391|This being done, we turned the bow full to the southward. 484334|1|315|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3392|The weather could by no means be considered disagreeable. 484391|2|315|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3393|We had a prevailing and very gentle wind from the northward, a smooth sea, and continual daylight. 484448|3|315|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3394|No ice whatever was to be seen; nor did I ever see one particle of this after leaving the parallel of Bennet's Islet. 484546|4|315|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3395|Indeed, the temperature of the water was here far too warm for its existence in any quantity. 484663|5|315|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3396|Having killed the largest of our tortoises, and obtained from him not only food but a copious supply of water, we continued on our course, without any incident of moment, for perhaps seven or eight days, during which period we must have proceeded a vast distance to the southward, as the wind blew constantly with us, and a very strong current set continually in the direction we were pursuing. 484756|6|315|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3399|A high range of light gray vapour appeared constantly in the southern horizon, flaring up occasionally in lofty streaks, now darting from east to west, now from west to east, and again presenting a level and uniform summit–in short, having all the wild variations of the Aurora Borealis. 485255|2|316|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3400|The average height of this vapour, as apparent from our station, was about twenty-five degrees. 485542|3|316|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3401|The temperature of the sea seemed to be increasing momentarily, and there was a very perceptible alteration in its colour. 485637|4|316|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3405|–To-day by repeated questioning of our captive, we came to the knowledge of many particulars in regard to the island of the massacre, its inhabitants, and customs–but with these how can I now detain the reader? 485948|1|318|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3406|I may say, however, that we learned there were eight islands in the group–that they were governed by a common king, named Tsalemon or Psalemoun, who resided in one of the smallest of the islands; that the black skins forming the dress of the warriors came from an animal of huge size to be found only in a valley near the court of the king–that the inhabitants of the group fabricated no other boats than the flat-bottomed rafts; the four canoes being all of the kind in their possession, and these having been obtained, by mere accident, from some large island in the southwest–that his own name was Nu-Nu–that he had no knowledge of Bennet's Islet–and that the appellation of the island he had left was Tsalal. 486158|2|318|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3407|The commencement of the words Tsalemon and Tsalal was given with a prolonged hissing sound, which we found it impossible to imitate, even after repeated endeavours, and which was precisely the same with the note of the black bittern we had eaten up on the summit of the hill. 486870|3|318|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3409|–The heat of the water was now truly remarkable, and in colour was undergoing a rapid change, being no longer transparent, but of a milky consistency and hue. 487153|1|319|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3410|In our immediate vicinity it was usually smooth, never so rough as to endanger the canoe–but we were frequently surprised at perceiving, to our right and left, at different distances, sudden and extensive agitations of the surface–these, we at length noticed, were always preceded by wild flickerings in the region of vapour to the southward. 487311|2|319|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3411|Getting now hold of the watch, I found, upon applying it to my ear, that it had again run down; but at this I was not at all surprised, being convinced, from the peculiar state of my feelings, that I had slept, as before, for a very long period of time, how long, it was of course impossible to say. 487653|0|32|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3413|The former I found after some little trouble; but, not discovering the tapers as soon as I had expected (for I remembered very nearly the spot in which I had placed them), I gave up the search for the present, and bidding Tiger lie quiet, began at once my journey toward the trap. 488018|10|32|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3414|I felt about the box for my little remaining supply of water, for I had no light, the taper having burnt to the socket of the lantern, and the phosphorus-box not coming readily to hand. 488298|2|32|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3415|Upon finding the jug, however, I discovered it to be empty–Tiger, no doubt, having been tempted to drink it, as well as to devour the remnant of mutton, the bone of which lay, well picked, by the opening of the box. 488483|3|32|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3417|I was feeble in the extreme–so much so that I shook all over, as with an ague, at the slightest movement or exertion. 488779|5|32|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3418|To add to my troubles, the brig was pitching and rolling with great violence, and the oil-casks which lay upon my box were in momentary danger of falling down, so as to block up the only way of ingress or egress. 488896|6|32|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3420|These considerations determined me to make my way, at all hazards, to the trap, and obtain immediate relief, before I should be incapacitated from doing so altogether. 489160|8|32|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3457|–A sullen darkness now hovered above us–but from out the milky depths of the ocean a luminous glare arose, and stole up along the bulwarks of the boat. 492453|1|326|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3458|We were nearly overwhelmed by the white ashy shower which settled upon us and upon the canoe, but melted into the water as it fell. 492604|2|326|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3459|The summit of the cataract was utterly lost in the dimness and the distance. 492735|3|326|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3460|Yet we were evidently approaching it with a hideous velocity. 492811|4|326|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3461|At intervals there were visible in it wide, yawning, but momentary rents, and from out these rents, within which was a chaos of flitting and indistinct images, there came rushing and mighty, but soundless winds, tearing up the enkindled ocean in their course. 492872|5|326|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3464|Many gigantic and pallidly white birds flew continuously now from beyond the veil, and their scream was the eternal Tekeli-li! 493265|2|327|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3465|as they retreated from our vision. 493391|3|327|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3466|Hereupon Nu-Nu stirred in the bottom of the boat; but upon touching him, we found his spirit departed. 493425|4|327|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3467|And now we rushed into the embraces of the cataract, where a chasm threw itself open to receive us. 493527|5|327|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3468|But there arose in our pathway a shrouded human figure, very far larger in its proportions than any dweller among men. 493626|6|327|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3469|And the hue of the skin of the figure was of the perfect whiteness of the snow. 493744|7|327|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3470|The circumstances connected with the late sudden and distressing death of Mr. Pym are already well known to the public through the medium of the daily press. 493823|0|329|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3471|It is feared that the few remaining chapters which were to have completed his narrative, and which were retained by him, while the above were in type, for the purpose of revision, have been irrecoverably lost through the accident by which he perished himself. 493980|1|329|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3472|This, however, may prove not to be the case, and the papers, if ultimately found, will be given to the public. 494239|2|329|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3473|In this attempt my great feebleness became more than ever apparent. 494349|0|33|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3474|It was with the utmost difficulty I could crawl along at all, and very frequently my limbs sank suddenly from beneath me; when, falling prostrate on my face, I would remain for some minutes in a state bordering on insensibility. 494416|1|33|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3475|Still I struggled forward by slow degrees, dreading every moment that I should swoon amid the narrow and intricate windings of the lumber, in which event I had nothing but death to expect as the result. 494644|2|33|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3476|At length, upon making a push forward with all the energy I could command, I struck my forehead violently against the sharp corner of an iron-bound crate. 494846|3|33|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3477|The accident only stunned me for a few moments; but I found, to my inexpressible grief, that the quick and violent roll of the vessel had thrown the crate entirely across my path, so as effectually to block up the passage. 495000|4|33|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3478|With my utmost exertions I could not move it a single inch from its position, it being closely wedged in among the surrounding boxes and ship-furniture. 495222|5|33|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3479|It became necessary, therefore, enfeebled as I was, either to leave the guidance of the whipcord and seek out a new passage, or to climb over the obstacle, and resume the path on the other side. 495374|6|33|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3480|The former alternative presented too many difficulties and dangers to be thought of without a shudder. 495568|7|33|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3481|In my present weak state of both mind and body, I should infallibly lose my way if I attempted it, and perish miserably amid the dismal and disgusting labyrinths of the hold. 495670|8|33|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3482|I proceeded, therefore, without hesitation, to summon up all my remaining strength and fortitude, and endeavour, as I best might, to clamber over the crate. 495844|9|33|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3484|The gentleman whose name is mentioned in the preface, and who, from the statement there made, might be supposed able to fill the vacuum, has declined the task–this for satisfactory reasons connected with the general inaccuracy of the details afforded him, and his disbelief in the entire truth of the latter portions of the narration. 496057|1|330|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3485|Peters, from whom some information might be expected, is still alive, and a resident of Illinois, but cannot be met with at present. 496391|2|330|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3486|He may hereafter be found, and will, no doubt, afford material for a conclusion of Mr. Pym's account. 496523|3|330|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3487|The loss of the two or three final chapters (for there were but two or three) is the more deeply to be regretted, as, it cannot be doubted, they contained matter relative to the Pole itself, or at least to regions in its very near proximity; and as, too, the statements of the author in relation to these regions may shortly be verified or contradicted by means of the governmental expedition now preparing for the Southern Ocean. 496624|0|331|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3488|On one point in the Narrative some remarks may be well offered; and it would afford the writer of this appendix much pleasure if what he may here observe should have a tendency to throw credit, in any degree, upon the very singular pages now published. 497054|0|332|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3489|We allude to the chasms found in the island of Tsalal, and to the whole of the figures presented in Chapter XXIII. 497306|1|332|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3490|Mr. Pym has given the figures of the chasm without comment, and speaks decidedly of the indentures found at the extremity of the most easterly of these chasms as having but a fanciful resemblance to alphabetical characters, and, in short, as being positively not such. 497420|0|333|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3491|This assertion is made in a manner so simple, and sustained by a species of demonstration so conclusive (viz. 497688|1|333|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3492|, the fitting of the projections of the fragments found among the dust into the indentures upon the wall), that we are forced to believe the writer in earnest; and no reasonable reader should suppose otherwise. 497797|2|333|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3493|But as the facts in relation to all the figures are most singular (especially when taken in connexion with statements made in the body of the narrative), it may be as well to say a word or two concerning them all–this, too, the more especially as the facts in question have, beyond doubt, escaped the attention of Mr. Poe. 498007|3|333|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3494|"Figure 1, then figure 2, figure 3, and figure 5, when conjoined with one another in the precise order which the chasms themselves presented, and when deprived of the small lateral branches or arches (which, it will be remembered, served only as means of communication between the main chambers, and were of totally distinct character), constitute an Ethiopian verbal root–the root (SEE ILLUSTRATION) ""To be shady""–whence all the inflections of shadow or darkness. 498329"|0|334|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3495|"In regard to the ""left or most northwardly"" of the indentures in figure 4, it is more than probable that the opinion of Peters was correct, and that the hieroglyphical appearance was really the work of art, and intended as the representation of a human form. 498792"|0|335|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3496|The delineation is before the reader, and he may, or may not, perceive the resemblance suggested; but the rest of the indentures afford strong confirmation of Peters' idea. 499050|1|335|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3497|"The upper range is evidently the Arabic verbal root (SEE ILLUSTRATION) ""To be white,"" whence all the inflections of brilliancy and whiteness. 499222"|2|335|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3498|The lower range is not so immediately perspicuous. 499363|3|335|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3499|"The characters are somewhat broken and disjointed; nevertheless, it cannot be doubted that, in their perfect state, they formed the full Egyptian word (SEE ILLUSTRATION), ""The region of the south"". 499413"|4|335|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3500|"It should be observed that these interpretations confirm the opinion of Peters in regard to the ""most northwardly"" of the figures. 499610"|5|335|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3506|This also was the shuddering exclamation of the captive Tsalalian upon encountering the white materials in possession of Mr. Pym. 500170|4|336|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3507|This also was the shriek of the swift-flying, white, and gigantic birds which issued from the vapoury white curtain of the South. 500299|5|336|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3508|Nothing white was to be found at Tsalal, and nothing otherwise in the subsequent voyage to the region beyond. 500428|6|336|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3509|"It is not impossible that ""Tsalal,"" the appellation of the island of the chasms, may be found, upon minute philological scrutiny, to betray either some alliance with the chasms themselves, or some reference to the Ethiopian characters so mysteriously written in their windings. 500537"|7|336|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3512|On each side of the narrow passage arose a complete wall of various heavy lumber, which the least blunder on my part might be the means of bringing down upon my head; or, if this accident did not occur, the path might be effectually blocked up against my return by the descending mass, as it was in front by the obstacle there. 501027|1|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3513|It did not rise as soon as I had expected, and I pressed it with somewhat more determination, still dreading lest some other person than Augustus might be in his state-room. 501354|10|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3514|The door, however, to my astonishment, remained steady, and I became somewhat uneasy, for I knew that it had formerly required but little or no effort to remove it. 501527|11|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3515|I pushed it strongly–it was nevertheless firm: with all my strength–it still did not give way: with rage, with fury, with despair–it set at defiance my utmost efforts; and it was evident, from the unyielding nature of the resistance, that the hole had either been discovered and effectually nailed up, or that some immense weight had been placed upon it, which it was useless to think of removing. 501691|12|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3516|The crate itself was a long and unwieldy box, upon which no foothold could be obtained. 502088|2|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3517|In vain I attempted, by every means in my power, to reach the top, with the hope of being thus enabled to draw myself up. 502175|3|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3518|Had I succeeded in reaching it, it is certain that my strength would have proved utterly inadequate to the task of getting over, and it was better in every respect that I failed. 502296|4|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3519|At length, in a desperate effort to force the crate from its ground, I felt a strong vibration in the side next me. 502474|5|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3520|I thrust my hand eagerly to the edge of the planks, and found that a very large one was loose. 502589|6|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3521|With my pocket-knife, which, luckily, I had with me, I succeeded, after great labour, in prying it entirely off; and getting it through the aperture, discovered, to my exceeding joy, that there were no boards on the opposite side–in other words, that the top was wanting, it being the bottom through which I had forced my way. 502683|7|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3523|With a beating heart I stood erect, and with a gentle touch pressed against the cover of the trap. 503110|9|34|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3526|As I sank, utterly exhausted, upon the mattress, Tiger threw himself at full length by my side, and seemed as if desirous, by his caresses, of consoling me in my troubles, and urging me to bear them with fortitude. 503340|10|35|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3527|I could summon up no connected chain of reflection, and, sinking on the floor, gave way, unresistingly, to the most gloomy imaginings, in which the dreadful deaths of thirst, famine, suffocation, and premature interment crowded upon me as the prominent disasters to be encountered. 503554|2|35|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3528|At length there returned to me some portion of presence of mind. 503835|3|35|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3529|I arose, and felt with my fingers for the seams or cracks of the aperture. 503899|4|35|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3530|Having found them, I examined them closely to ascertain if they emitted any light from the state-room; but none was visible. 503973|5|35|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3531|I then forced the blade of my pen-knife through them, until I met with some hard obstacle. 504097|6|35|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3532|Scraping against it, I discovered it to be a solid mass of iron, which, from its peculiar wavy feel as I passed the blade along it, I concluded to be a chain-cable. 504187|7|35|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3533|The only course now left me was to retrace my way to the box, and there either yield to my sad fate, or try so to tranquilize my mind as to admit of my arranging some plan of escape. 504351|8|35|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3534|I immediately set about the attempt, and succeeded, after innumerable difficulties, in getting back. 504533|9|35|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3535|The singularity of his behavior at length forcibly arrested my attention. 504633|0|36|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3536|After licking my face and hands for some minutes, he would suddenly cease doing so, and utter a low whine. 504706|1|36|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3537|Upon a closer scrutiny, I came across a small slip of what had the feeling of letter paper, through which the string had been fastened in such a manner as to bring it immediately beneath the left shoulder of the animal. 504812|10|36|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3538|Upon reaching out my hand toward him, I then invariably found him lying on his back, with his paws uplifted. 505031|2|36|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3539|This conduct, so frequently repeated, appeared strange, and I could in no manner account for it. 505139|3|36|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3540|As the dog seemed distressed, I concluded that he had received some injury; and, taking his paws in my hands, I examined them one by one, but found no sign of any hurt. 505235|4|36|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3541|I then supposed him hungry, and gave him a large piece of ham, which he devoured with avidity–afterward, however, resuming his extraordinary manoeuvres. 505403|5|36|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3542|I now imagined that he was suffering, like myself, the torments of thirst, and was about adopting this conclusion as the true one, when the idea occurred to me that I had as yet only examined his paws, and that there might possibly be a wound upon some portion of his body or head. 505555|6|36|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3543|The latter I felt carefully over, but found nothing. 505836|7|36|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3544|On passing my hand, however, along his back, I perceived a slight erection of the hair extending completely across it. 505888|8|36|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3545|Probing this with my finger, I discovered a string, and tracing it up, found that it encircled the whole body. 506006|9|36|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3546|The thought instantly occurred to me that the paper was a note from Augustus, and that some unaccountable accident having happened to prevent his relieving me from my dungeon, he had devised this method of acquainting me with the true state of affairs. 506116|0|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3547|Trembling with eagerness, I now commenced another search for my phosphorus matches and tapers. 506368|1|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3548|I concluded at once that he had devoured the whole of my supply of candles, and I felt hopeless of being ever able to read the note of Augustus. 506462|10|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3549|The small remnants of the wax were so mashed up among other rubbish in the barrel, that I despaired of deriving any service from them, and left them as they were. 506606|11|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3550|The phosphorus, of which there was only a speck or two, I gathered up as well as I could, and returned with it, after much difficulty, to my box, where Tiger had all the while remained. 506768|12|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3551|I had a confused recollection of having put them carefully away just before falling asleep; and, indeed, previously to my last journey to the trap, I had been able to remember the exact spot where I had deposited them. 506953|2|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3552|But now I endeavored in vain to call it to mind, and busied myself for a full hour in a fruitless and vexatious search for the missing articles; never, surely, was there a more tantalizing state of anxiety and suspense. 507171|3|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3553|At length, while groping about, with my head close to the ballast, near the opening of the box, and outside of it, I perceived a faint glimmering of light in the direction of the steerage. 507390|4|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3554|Greatly surprised, I endeavored to make my way toward it, as it appeared to be but a few feet from my position. 507578|5|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3555|Scarcely had I moved with this intention, when I lost sight of the glimmer entirely, and, before I could bring it into view again, was obliged to feel along by the box until I had exactly resumed my original situation. 507689|6|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3556|Now, moving my head with caution to and fro, I found that, by proceeding slowly, with great care, in an opposite direction to that in which I had at first started, I was enabled to draw near the light, still keeping it in view. 507907|7|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3557|Presently I came directly upon it (having squeezed my way through innumerable narrow windings), and found that it proceeded from some fragments of my matches lying in an empty barrel turned upon its side. 508134|8|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3558|I was wondering how they came in such a place, when my hand fell upon two or three pieces of taper wax, which had been evidently mumbled by the dog. 508338|9|37|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3559|What to do next I could not tell. 508486|0|38|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3560|The hold was so intensely dark that I could not see my hand, however close I would hold it to my face. 508519|1|38|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3561|The white slip of paper could barely be discerned, and not even that when I looked at it directly; by turning the exterior portions of the retina toward it–that is to say, by surveying it slightly askance, I found that it became in some measure perceptible. 508621|2|38|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3562|Thus the gloom of my prison may be imagined, and the note of my friend, if indeed it were a note from him, seemed only likely to throw me into further trouble, by disquieting to no purpose my already enfeebled and agitated mind. 508878|3|38|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3563|In vain I revolved in my brain a multitude of absurd expedients for procuring light–such expedients precisely as a man in the perturbed sleep occasioned by opium would be apt to fall upon for a similar purpose–each and all of which appear by turns to the dreamer the most reasonable and the most preposterous of conceptions, just as the reasoning or imaginative faculties flicker, alternately, one above the other. 509106|4|38|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3564|At last an idea occurred to me which seemed rational, and which gave me cause to wonder, very justly, that I had not entertained it before. 509520|5|38|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3565|I placed the slip of paper on the back of a book, and, collecting the fragments of the phosphorus matches which I had brought from the barrel, laid them together upon the paper. 509659|6|38|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3566|I then, with the palm of my hand, rubbed the whole over quickly, yet steadily. 509836|7|38|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3567|A clear light diffused itself immediately throughout the whole surface; and had there been any writing upon it, I should not have experienced the least difficulty, I am sure, in reading it. 509914|8|38|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3568|Not a syllable was there, however–nothing but a dreary and unsatisfactory blank; the illumination died away in a few seconds, and my heart died away within me as it went. 510103|9|38|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3569|I have before stated more than once that my intellect, for some period prior to this, had been in a condition nearly bordering on idiocy. 510273|0|39|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3570|There were, to be sure, momentary intervals of perfect sanity, and, now and then, even of energy; but these were few. 510410|1|39|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3571|It must be remembered that I had been, for many days certainly, inhaling the almost pestilential atmosphere of a close hold in a whaling vessel, and for a long portion of that time but scantily supplied with water. 510527|2|39|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3572|For the last fourteen or fifteen hours I had none–nor had I slept during that time. 510741|3|39|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3573|Salt provisions of the most exciting kind had been my chief, and, indeed, since the loss of the mutton, my only supply of food, with the exception of the sea-biscuit; and these latter were utterly useless to me, as they were too dry and hard to be swallowed in the swollen and parched condition of my throat. 510824|4|39|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3574|I was now in a high state of fever, and in every respect exceedingly ill. 511132|5|39|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3575|This will account for the fact that many miserable hours of despondency elapsed after my last adventure with the phosphorus, before the thought suggested itself that I had examined only one side of the paper. 511205|6|39|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3576|I shall not attempt to describe my feelings of rage (for I believe I was more angry than any thing else) when the egregious oversight I had committed flashed suddenly upon my perception. 511413|7|39|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3577|The blunder itself would have been unimportant, had not my own folly and impetuosity rendered it otherwise–in my disappointment at not finding some words upon the slip, I had childishly torn it in pieces and thrown it away, it was impossible to say where. 511599|8|39|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3578|This expose being made, it will be seen at once how much of what follows I claim to be my own writing; and it will also be understood that no fact is misrepresented in the first few pages which were written by Mr. Poe. 511854|0|4|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3579|Even to those readers who have not seen the Messenger, it will be unnecessary to point out where his portion ends and my own commences; the difference in point of style will be readily perceived. 512072|1|4|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3580|From the worst part of this dilemma I was relieved by the sagacity of Tiger. 512267|0|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3581|Having got, after a long search, a small piece of the note, I put it to the dog's nose, and endeavored to make him understand that he must bring me the rest of it. 512343|1|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3582|There was the greater necessity of ascertaining the point in question beyond a doubt, as the phosphorus remaining would be altogether insufficient for a third attempt, should I fail in the one I was now about to make. 512506|10|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3583|I placed the paper on a book as before, and sat for some minutes thoughtfully revolving the matter over in my mind. 512723|11|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3584|At last I thought it barely possible that the written side might have some unevenness on its surface, which a delicate sense of feeling might enable me to detect. 512838|12|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3585|I determined to make the experiment and passed my finger very carefully over the side which first presented itself. 513000|13|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3586|Nothing, however, was perceptible, and I turned the paper, adjusting it on the book. 513115|14|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3587|I now again carried my forefinger cautiously along, when I was aware of an exceedingly slight, but still discernable glow, which followed as it proceeded. 513199|15|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3588|This, I knew, must arise from some very minute remaining particles of the phosphorus with which I had covered the paper in my previous attempt. 513353|16|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3589|The other, or under side, then, was that on which lay the writing, if writing there should finally prove to be. 513496|17|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3590|Again I turned the note, and went to work as I had previously done. 513607|18|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3591|Having rubbed in the phosphorus, a brilliancy ensued as before–but this time several lines of MS. 513674|19|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3592|To my astonishment, (for I had taught him none of the usual tricks for which his breed are famous,) he seemed to enter at once into my meaning, and, rummaging about for a few moments, soon found another considerable portion. 513771|2|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3593|in a large hand, and apparently in red ink, became distinctly visible. 513995|20|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3594|The glimmer, although sufficiently bright, was but momentary. 514065|21|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3595|Still, had I not been too greatly excited, there would have been ample time enough for me to peruse the whole three sentences before me–for I saw there were three. 514126|22|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3596|"In my anxiety, however, to read all at once, I succeeded only in reading the seven concluding words, which thus appeared–""blood- your life depends upon lying close"". 514289"|23|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3597|Bringing me this, he paused awhile, and, rubbing his nose against my hand, appeared to be waiting for my approval of what he had done. 514454|3|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3598|I patted him on the head, when he immediately made off again. 514588|4|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3599|It was now some minutes before he came back–but when he did come, he brought with him a large slip, which proved to be all the paper missing–it having been torn, it seems, only into three pieces. 514649|5|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3600|Luckily, I had no trouble in finding what few fragments of the phosphorus were left- being guided by the indistinct glow one or two of the particles still emitted. 514844|6|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3601|My difficulties had taught me the necessity of caution, and I now took time to reflect upon what I was about to do. 515007|7|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3602|It was very probable, I considered, that some words were written upon that side of the paper which had not been examined–but which side was that? 515122|8|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3603|Fitting the pieces together gave me no clew in this respect, although it assured me that the words (if there were any) would be found all on one side, and connected in a proper manner, as written. 515267|9|40|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3604|Had I been able to ascertain the entire contents of the note-the full meaning of the admonition which my friend had thus attempted to convey, that admonition, even although it should have revealed a story of disaster the most unspeakable, could not, I am firmly convinced, have imbued my mind with one tithe of the harrowing and yet indefinable horror with which I was inspired by the fragmentary warning thus received. 515463|0|41|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3605|"And ""blood,"" too, that word of all words–so rife at all times with mystery, and suffering, and terror–how trebly full of import did it now appear–how chilly and heavily (disjointed, as it thus was, from any foregoing words to qualify or render it distinct) did its vague syllables fall, amid the deep gloom of my prison, into the innermost recesses of my soul! 515882"|1|41|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3606|Augustus had, undoubtedly, good reasons for wishing me to remain concealed, and I formed a thousand surmises as to what they could be–but I could think of nothing affording a satisfactory solution of the mystery. 516242|0|42|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3607|just after returning from my last journey to the trap, and before my attention had been otherwise directed by the singular conduct of Tiger, I had come to the resolution of making myself heard at all events by those on board, or, if I could not succeed in this directly, of trying to cut my way through the orlop deck. 516454|1|42|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3608|The half certainty which I felt of being able to accomplish one of these two purposes in the last emergency, had given me courage (which I should not otherwise have had) to endure the evils of my situation. 516772|2|42|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3609|The few words I had been able to read, however, had cut me off from these final resources, and I now, for the first time, felt all the misery of my fate. 516978|3|42|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3610|In a paroxysm of despair I threw myself again upon the mattress, where, for about the period of a day and night, I lay in a kind of stupor, relieved only by momentary intervals of reason and recollection. 517131|4|42|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3611|At length I once more arose, and busied myself in reflection upon the horrors which encompassed me. 517335|0|43|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3612|For another twenty-four hours it was barely possible that I might exist without water–for a longer time I could not do so. 517434|1|43|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3613|During the first portion of my imprisonment I had made free use of the cordials with which Augustus had supplied me, but they only served to excite fever, without in the least degree assuaging thirst. 517556|2|43|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3614|I had now only about a gill left, and this was of a species of strong peach liqueur at which my stomach revolted. 517756|3|43|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3615|The sausages were entirely consumed; of the ham nothing remained but a small piece of the skin; and all the biscuit, except a few fragments of one, had been eaten by Tiger. 517869|4|43|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3616|To add to my troubles, I found that my headache was increasing momentarily, and with it the species of delirium which had distressed me more or less since my first falling asleep. 518041|5|43|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3617|For some hours past it had been with the greatest difficulty I could breathe at all, and now each attempt at so doing was attended with the most depressing spasmodic action of the chest. 518220|6|43|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3618|But there was still another and very different source of disquietude, and one, indeed, whose harassing terrors had been the chief means of arousing me to exertion from my stupor on the mattress. 518406|7|43|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3619|It arose from the demeanor of the dog. 518600|8|43|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3620|I first observed an alteration in his conduct while rubbing in the phosphorus on the paper in my last attempt. 518638|0|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3621|As I rubbed, he ran his nose against my hand with a slight snarl; but I was too greatly excited at the time to pay much attention to the circumstance. 518748|1|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3622|I could distinctly perceive his eyes fastened upon me with an expression of the most deadly animosity, and I expected every instant that he would attack me. 518898|10|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3623|At last I could endure my terrible situation no longer, and determined to make my way from the box at all hazards, and dispatch him, if his opposition should render it necessary for me to do so. 519054|11|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3624|To get out, I had to pass directly over his body, and he already seemed to anticipate my design–missing himself upon his fore. 519248|12|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3625|legs (as I perceived by the altered position of his eyes), and displayed the whole of his white fangs, which were easily discernible. 519374|13|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3626|I took the remains of the ham-skin, and the bottle containing the liqueur, and secured them about my person, together with a large carving-knife which Augustus had left me–then, folding my cloak around me as closely as possible, I made a movement toward the mouth of the box. 519507|14|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3627|No sooner did I do this, than the dog sprang with a loud growl toward my throat. 519782|15|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3628|The whole weight of his body struck me on the right shoulder, and I fell violently to the left, while the enraged animal passed entirely over me. 519862|16|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3629|I had fAllan upon my knees, with my head buried among the blankets, and these protected me from a second furious assault, during which I felt the sharp teeth pressing vigorously upon the woollen which enveloped my neck–yet, luckily, without being able to penetrate all the folds. 520007|17|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3630|I was now beneath the dog, and a few moments would place me completely in his power. 520286|18|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3631|Despair gave me strength, and I rose boldly up, shaking him from me by main force, and dragging with me the blankets from the mattress. 520370|19|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3632|Soon afterward, it will be remembered, I threw myself on the mattress, and fell into a species of lethargy. 520505|2|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3633|These I now threw over him, and before he could extricate himself, I had got through the door and closed it effectually against his pursuit. 520612|20|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3634|In this struggle, however, I had been forced to drop the morsel of ham-skin, and I now found my whole stock of provisions reduced to a single gill of liqueur, As this reflection crossed my mind, I felt myself actuated by one of those fits of perverseness which might be supposed to influence a spoiled child in similar circumstances, and, raising the bottle to my lips, I drained it to the last drop, and dashed it furiously upon the floor. 520752|21|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3635|Presently I became aware of a singular hissing sound close at my ears, and discovered it to proceed from Tiger, who was panting and wheezing in a state of the greatest apparent excitement, his eyeballs flashing fiercely through the gloom. 521192|3|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3636|I spoke to him, when he replied with a low growl, and then remained quiet. 521430|4|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3637|Presently I relapsed into my stupor, from which I was again awakened in a similar manner. 521504|5|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3638|This was repeated three or four times, until finally his behaviour inspired me with so great a degree of fear, that I became fully aroused. 521593|6|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3639|He was now lying close by the door of the box, snarling fearfully, although in a kind of undertone, and grinding his teeth as if strongly convulsed. 521732|7|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3640|I had no doubt whatever that the want of water or the confined atmosphere of the hold had driven him mad, and I was at a loss what course to pursue. 521880|8|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3641|I could not endure the thought of killing him, yet it seemed absolutely necessary for my own safety. 522028|9|44|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3642|Scarcely had the echo of the crash died away, when I heard my name pronounced in an eager but subdued voice, issuing from the direction of the steerage. 522128|0|45|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3643|So unexpected was anything of the kind, and so intense was the emotion excited within me by the sound, that I endeavoured in vain to reply. 522280|1|45|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3644|My brain reeled, and I fell, deadly sick, against the end of the box. 522419|10|45|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3645|My powers of speech totally failed, and in an agony of terror lest my friend should conclude me dead, and return without attempting to reach me, I stood up between the crates near the door of the box, trembling convulsively, and gasping and struggling for utterance. 522488|2|45|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3646|Had a thousand words depended upon a syllable, I could not have spoken it. 522754|3|45|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3647|There was a slight movement now audible among the lumber somewhere forward of my station. 522828|4|45|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3648|The sound presently grew less distinct, then again less so, and still less. 522917|5|45|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3649|Shall I ever forget my feelings at this moment? 522992|6|45|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3650|He was going- my friend, my companion, from whom I had a right to expect so much- he was going–he would abandon me–he was gone! 523039|7|45|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3651|He would leave me to perish miserably, to expire in the most horrible and loathesome of dungeons–and one word, one little syllable, would save me–yet that single syllable I could not utter! 523166|8|45|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3652|I felt, I am sure, more than ten thousand times the agonies of death itself. 523355|9|45|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3653|As I fell the carving-knife was shaken out from the waist-band of my pantaloons, and dropped with a rattling sound to the floor. 523431|0|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3654|Never did any strain of the richest melody come so sweetly to my ears! 523559|1|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3655|"he replied, in a voice trembling with agitation; ""I will be with you immediately–as soon as I can make my way through the hold"". 523629"|10|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3656|For a long time I heard him moving among the lumber, and every moment seemed to me an age. 523757|11|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3657|At length I felt his hand upon my shoulder, and he placed, at the same moment, a bottle of water to my lips. 523847|12|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3658|Those only who have been suddenly redeemed from the jaws of the tomb, or who have known the insufferable torments of thirst under circumstances as aggravated as those which encompassed me in my dreary prison, can form any idea of the unutterable transports which that one long draught of the richest of all physical luxuries afforded. 523955|13|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3659|With the intensest anxiety I listened to ascertain the effect of the noise upon Augustus–for I knew that the person who called my name could be no one but himself. 524289|2|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3660|All was silent for some moments. 524452|3|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3661|"At length I again heard the word ""Arthur""! 524484"|4|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3662|repeated in a low tone, and one full of hesitation. 524526|5|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3663|"Reviving hope loosened at once my powers of speech, and I now screamed at the top of my voice, ""Augustus! 524577"|6|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3664|"oh, Augustus""! 524682"|7|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3665|"""Hush! 524696"|8|46|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3667|When I had in some degree satisfied my thirst, Augustus produced from his pocket three or four boiled potatoes, which I devoured with the greatest avidity. 524728|0|47|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3668|He had brought with him a light in a dark lantern, and the grateful rays afforded me scarcely less comfort than the food and drink. 524883|1|47|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3669|But I was impatient to learn the cause of his protracted absence, and he proceeded to recount what had happened on board during my incarceration. 525014|2|47|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3670|The brig put to sea, as I had supposed, in about an hour after he had left the watch. 525159|0|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3671|This was on the twentieth of June. 525244|1|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3672|ply. 525278|10|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3673|When he descended for this purpose he found that I was asleep, for it seems that I was snoring very loudly. 525282|11|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3674|From all the calculations I can make on the subject, this must have been the slumber into which I fell just after my return from the trap with the watch, and which, consequently, must have lasted for more than three entire days and nights at the very least. 525389|12|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3675|Latterly, I have had reason both from my own experience and the assurance of others, to be acquainted with the strong soporific effects of the stench arising from old fish-oil when closely confined; and when I think of the condition of the hold in which I was imprisoned, and the long period during which the brig had been used as a whaling vessel, I am more inclined to wonder that I awoke at all, after once falling asleep, than that I should have slept uninterruptedly for the period specified above. 525646|13|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3676|It will be remembered that I had then been in the hold for three days; and, during this period, there was so constant a bustle on board, and so much running to and fro, especially in the cabin and staterooms, that he had had no chance of visiting me without the risk of having the secret of the trap discovered. 526149|2|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3677|When at length he did come, I had assured him that I was doing as well as possible; and, therefore, for the two next days be felt but little uneasiness on my account–still, however, watching an opportunity of going down. 526460|3|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3678|It was not until the fourth day that he found one. 526680|4|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3679|Several times during this interval he had made up his mind to let his father know of the adventure, and have me come up at once; but we were still within reaching distance of Nantucket, and it was doubtful, from some expressions which had escaped Captain Barnard, whether he would not immediately put back if he discovered me to be on board. 526730|5|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3680|Besides, upon thinking the matter over, Augustus, so he told me, could not imagine that I was in immediate want, or that I would hesitate, in such case, to make myself heard at the trap. 527071|6|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3681|When, therefore, he considered everything he concluded to let me stay until he could meet with an opportunity of visiting me unobserved. 527257|7|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3682|This, as I said before, did not occur until the fourth day after his bringing me the watch, and the seventh since I had first entered the hold. 527393|8|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3683|He then went down without taking with him any water or provisions, intending in the first place merely to call my attention, and get me to come from the box to the trap,–when he would go up to the stateroom and thence hand me down a sup. 527536|9|48|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3684|Augustus called to me at first in a low voice and without closing the trap–but I made him no reply. 527773|0|49|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3685|He then shut the trap, and spoke to me in a louder, and finally in a very loud tone–still I continued to snore. 527872|1|49|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3686|He was now at a loss what to do. 527983|2|49|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3687|It would take him some time to make his way through the lumber to my box, and in the meanwhile his absence would be noticed by Captain Barnard, who had occasion for his services every minute, in arranging and copying papers connected with the business of the voyage. 528015|3|49|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3688|He determined, therefore, upon reflection, to ascend, and await another opportunity of visiting me. 528281|4|49|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3689|He was the more easily induced to this resolve, as my slumber appeared to be of the most tranquil nature, and he could not suppose that I had undergone any inconvenience from my incarceration. 528380|5|49|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3690|He had just made up his mind on these points when his attention was arrested by an unusual bustle, the sound of which proceeded apparently from the cabin. 528572|6|49|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3691|He sprang through the trap as quickly as possible, closed it, and threw open the door of his stateroom. 528726|7|49|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3692|No sooner had he put his foot over the threshold than a pistol flashed in his face, and he was knocked down, at the same moment, by a blow from a handspike. 528829|8|49|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3695|A strong hand held him on the cabin floor, with a tight grasp upon his throat; still he was able to see what was going on around him. 529016|0|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3696|His father was tied hand and foot, and lying along the steps of the companion-way, with his head down, and a deep wound in the forehead, from which the blood was flowing in a continued stream. 529149|1|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3697|It was some minutes before any one appeared:–at last an Englishman, who had shipped as a raw hand, came up, weeping piteously, and entreating the mate, in the most humble manner, to spare his life. 529341|10|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3698|The only reply was a blow on the forehead from an axe. 529538|11|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3699|The poor fellow fell to the deck without a groan, and the black cook lifted him up in his arms as he would a child, and tossed him deliberately into the sea. 529592|12|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3700|Hearing the blow and the plunge of the body, the men below could now be induced to venture on deck neither by threats nor promises, until a proposition was made to smoke them out. 529749|13|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3701|A general rush then ensued, and for a moment it seemed possible that the brig might be retaken. 529928|14|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3702|The mutineers, however, succeeded at last in closing the forecastle effectually before more than six of their opponents could get up. 530023|15|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3703|These six, finding themselves so greatly outnumbered and without arms, submitted after a brief struggle. 530156|16|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3704|The mate gave them fair words–no doubt with a view of inducing those below to yield, for they had no difficulty in hearing all that was said on deck. 530260|17|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3705|The result proved his sagacity, no less than his diabolical villainy. 530409|18|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3706|All in the forecastle presently signified their intention of submitting, and, ascending one by one, were pinioned and then thrown on their backs, together with the first six–there being in all, of the crew who were not concerned in the mutiny, twenty-seven. 530478|19|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3707|He spoke not a word, and was apparently dying. 530735|2|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3708|Over him stood the first mate, eyeing him with an expression of fiendish derision, and deliberately searching his pockets, from which he presently drew forth a large wallet and a chronometer. 530781|3|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3709|Seven of the crew (among whom was the cook, a negro) were rummaging the staterooms on the larboard for arms, where they soon equipped themselves with muskets and ammunition. 530972|4|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3710|Besides Augustus and Captain Barnard, there were nine men altogether in the cabin, and these among the most ruffianly of the brig's company. 531145|5|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3711|The villains now went upon deck, taking my friend with them after having secured his arms behind his back. 531285|6|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3712|They proceeded straight to the forecastle, which was fastened down–two of the mutineers standing by it with axes–two also at the main hatch. 531391|7|50|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3719|He was short in stature, not more than four feet eight inches high, but his limbs were of Herculean mould. 531939|12|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3720|His hands, especially, were so enormously thick and broad as hardly to retain a human shape. 532045|13|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3721|His arms, as well as legs, were bowed in the most singular manner, and appeared to possess no flexibility whatever. 532137|14|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3722|His head was equally deformed, being of immense size, with an indentation on the crown (like that on the head of most negroes), and entirely bald. 532252|15|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3723|To conceal this latter deficiency, which did not proceed from old age, he usually wore a wig formed of any hair-like material which presented itself–occasionally the skin of a Spanish dog or American grizzly bear. 532398|16|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3724|At the time spoken of, he had on a portion of one of these bearskins; and it added no little to the natural ferocity of his countenance, which betook of the Upsaroka character. 532611|17|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3725|The mouth extended nearly from ear to ear, the lips were thin, and seemed, like some other portions of his frame, to be devoid of natural pliancy, so that the ruling expression never varied under the influence of any emotion whatever. 532787|18|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3726|This ruling expression may be conceived when it is considered that the teeth were exceedingly long and protruding, and never even partially covered, in any instance, by the lips. 533021|19|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3727|Here the cook stood with an axe, striking each victim on the head as he was forced over the side of the vessel by the other mutineers. 533199|2|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3728|To pass this man with a casual glance, one might imagine him to be convulsed with laughter, but a second look would induce a shuddering acknowledgment, that if such an expression were indicative of merriment, the merriment must be that of a demon. 533333|20|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3729|Of this singular being many anecdotes were prevalent among the seafaring men of Nantucket. 533580|21|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3730|These anecdotes went to prove his prodigious strength when under excitement, and some of them had given rise to a doubt of his sanity. 533670|22|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3731|But on board the Grampus, it seems, he was regarded, at the time of the mutiny, with feelings more of derision than of anything else. 533804|23|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3732|I have been thus particular in speaking of Dirk Peters, because, ferocious as he appeared, he proved the main instrument in preserving the life of Augustus, and because I shall have frequent occasion to mention him hereafter in the course of my narrative–a narrative, let me here say, which, in its latter portions, will be found to include incidents of a nature so entirely out of the range of human experience, and for this reason so far beyond the limits of human credulity, that I proceed in utter hopelessness of obtaining credence for all that I shall tell, yet confidently trusting in time and progressing science to verify some of the most important and most improbable of my statements. 533937|24|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3733|In this manner twenty-two perished, and Augustus had given himself up for lost, expecting every moment his own turn to come next. 534632|3|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3734|But it seemed that the villains were now either weary, or in some measure disgusted with their bloody labour; for the four remaining prisoners, together with my friend, who had been thrown on the deck with the rest, were respited while the mate sent below for rum, and the whole murderous party held a drunken carouse, which lasted until sunset. 534761|4|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3735|They now fell to disputing in regard to the fate of the survivors, who lay not more than four paces off, and could distinguish every word said. 535106|5|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3736|Upon some of the mutineers the liquor appeared to have a softening effect, for several voices were heard in favor of releasing the captives altogether, on condition of joining the mutiny and sharing the profits. 535249|6|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3737|The black cook, however (who in all respects was a perfect demon, and who seemed to exert as much influence, if not more, than the mate himself), would listen to no proposition of the kind, and rose repeatedly for the purpose of resuming his work at the gangway. 535460|7|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3738|Fortunately he was so far overcome by intoxication as to be easily restrained by the less bloodthirsty of the party, among whom was a line-manager, who went by the name of Dirk Peters. 535722|8|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3739|This man was the son of an Indian squaw of the tribe of Upsarokas, who live among the fastnesses of the Black Hills, near the source of the Missouri. 535906|9|51|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3740|After much indecision and two or three violent quarrels, it was determined at last that all the prisoners (with the exception of Augustus, whom Peters insisted in a jocular manner upon keeping as his clerk) should be set adrift in one of the smallest whaleboats. 536055|0|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3741|The mate went down into the cabin to see if Captain Barnard was still living–for, it will be remembered, he was left below when the mutineers came up. 536317|1|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3742|The boat was instantly out of sight, and little hope could be entertained for the unfortunate sufferers who were in it. 536467|10|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3743|This event happened, however, in latitude 35 degrees 30' north, longitude 61 degrees 20' west, and consequently at no very great distance from the Bermuda Islands. 536586|11|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3744|Augustus therefore endeavored to console himself with the idea that the boat might either succeed in reaching the land, or come sufficiently near to be fAllan in with by vessels off the coast. 536749|12|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3745|Presently the two made their appearance, the captain pale as death, but somewhat recovered from the effects of his wound. 536941|2|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3746|He spoke to the men in a voice hardly articulate, entreated them not to set him adrift, but to return to their duty, and promising to land them wherever they chose, and to take no steps for bringing them to justice. 537062|3|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3747|He might as well have spoken to the winds. 537277|4|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3748|Two of the ruffians seized him by the arms and hurled him over the brig's side into the boat, which had been lowered while the mate went below. 537319|5|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3749|The four men who were lying on the deck were then untied and ordered to follow, which they did without attempting any resistance–Augustus being still left in his painful position, although he struggled and prayed only for the poor satisfaction of being permitted to bid his father farewell. 537462|6|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3750|A handful of sea-biscuit and a jug of water were now handed down; but neither mast, sail, oar, nor compass. 537752|7|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3751|The boat was towed astern for a few minutes, during which the mutineers held another consultation–it was then finally cut adrift. 537859|8|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3752|By this time night had come on–there were neither moon nor stars visible–and a short and ugly sea was running, although there was no great deal of wind. 537988|9|52|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3753|All sail was now put upon the brig, and she continued her original course to the southwest–the mutineers being bent upon some piratical expedition, in which, from all that could be understood, a ship was to be intercepted on her way from the Cape Verd Islands to Porto Rico. 538140|0|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3754|No attention was paid to Augustus, who was untied and suffered to go about anywhere forward of the cabin companion-way. 538414|1|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3755|To remove it without discovery was impossible, and he returned on deck as quickly as he could. 538533|10|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3756|As be came up, the mate seized him by the throat, and demanding what he had been doing in the cabin, was about flinging him over the larboard bulwark, when his life was again preserved through the interference of Dirk Peters. 538627|11|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3757|Augustus was now put in handcuffs (of which there were several pairs on board), and his feet lashed tightly together. 538852|12|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3758|"He was then taken into the steerage, and thrown into a lower berth next to the forecastle bulkheads, with the assurance that he should never put his foot on deck again ""until the brig was no longer a brig"". 538969"|13|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3759|This was the expression of the cook, who threw him into the berth–it is hardly possible to say what precise meaning intended by the phrase. 539175|14|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3760|The whole affair, however, proved the ultimate means of my relief, as will presently appear. 539314|15|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3761|Dirk Peters treated him with some degree of kindness, and on one occasion saved him from the brutality of the cook. 539406|2|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3762|His situation was still one of the most precarious, as the men were continually intoxicated, and there was no relying upon their continued good-humor or carelessness in regard to himself. 539521|3|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3763|His anxiety on my account be represented, however, as the most distressing result of his condition; and, indeed, I had never reason to doubt the sincerity of his friendship. 539708|4|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3764|More than once he had resolved to acquaint the mutineers with the secret of my being on board, but was restrained from so doing, partly through recollection of the atrocities he had already beheld, and partly through a hope of being able soon to bring me relief. 539881|5|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3765|For the latter purpose he was constantly on the watch; but, in spite of the most constant vigilance, three days elapsed after the boat was cut adrift before any chance occurred. 540143|6|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3766|At length, on the night of the third day, there came on a heavy blow from the eastward, and all hands were called up to take in sail. 540320|7|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3767|During the confusion which ensued, he made his way below unobserved, and into the stateroom. 540453|8|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3768|What was his grief and horror in discovering that the latter had been rendered a place of deposit for a variety of sea-stores and ship-furniture, and that several fathoms of old chain-cable, which had been stowed away beneath the companion-ladder, had been dragged thence to make room for a chest, and were now lying immediately upon the trap! 540545|9|53|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3769|For some minutes after the cook had left the forecastle, Augustus abandoned himself to despair, never hoping to leave the berth alive. 540888|0|54|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3770|He now came to the resolution of acquainting the first of the men who should come down with my situation, thinking it better to let me take my chance with the mutineers than perish of thirst in the hold,–for it had been ten days since I was first imprisoned, and my jug of water was not a plentiful supply even for four. 541022|1|54|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3771|As he was thinking on this subject, the idea came all at once into his head that it might be possible to communicate with me by the way of the main hold. 541342|2|54|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3772|In any other circumstances, the difficulty and hazard of the undertaking would have pre. 541495|3|54|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3773|vented him from attempting it; but now he had, at all events, little prospect of life, and consequently little to lose, he bent his whole mind, therefore, upon the task. 541583|4|54|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3774|His handcuffs were the first consideration. 541752|0|55|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3775|At first he saw no method of removing them, and feared that he should thus be baffled in the very outset; but upon a closer scrutiny he discovered that the irons could be slipped off and on at pleasure, with very little effort or inconvenience, merely by squeezing his hands through them,–this species of manacle being altogether ineffectual in confining young persons, in whom the smaller bones readily yield to pressure. 541795|1|55|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3776|He now untied his feet, and, leaving the cord in such a manner that it could easily be readjusted in the event of any person's coming down, proceeded to examine the bulkhead where it joined the berth. 542217|2|55|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3777|The partition here was of soft pine board, an inch thick, and he saw that he should have little trouble in cutting his way through. 542417|3|55|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3778|A voice was now heard at the forecastle companion-way, and he had just time to put his right hand into its handcuff (the left had not been removed) and to draw the rope in a slipknot around his ankle, when Dirk Peters came below, followed by Tiger, who immediately leaped into the berth and lay down. 542548|4|55|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3779|The dog had been brought on board by Augustus, who knew my attachment to the animal, and thought it would give me pleasure to have him with me during the voyage. 542848|5|55|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3780|He went up to our house for him immediately after first taking me into the hold, but did not think of mentioning the circumstance upon his bringing the watch. 543009|6|55|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3781|Since the mutiny, Augustus had not seen him before his appearance with Dirk Peters, and had given him up for lost, supposing him to have been thrown overboard by some of the malignant villains belonging to the mate's gang. 543167|7|55|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3782|It appeared afterward that he had crawled into a hole beneath a whale-boat, from which, not having room to turn round, he could not extricate himself. 543389|8|55|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3783|Peters at last let him out, and, with a species of good feeling which my friend knew well how to appreciate, had now brought him to him in the forecastle as a companion, leaving at the same time some salt junk and potatoes, with a can of water, he then went on deck, promising to come down with something more to eat on the next day. 543539|9|55|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3784|When he had gone, Augustus freed both hands from the manacles and unfastened his feet. 543872|0|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3785|He then turned down the head of the mattress on which he had been lying, and with his penknife (for the ruffians had not thought it worth while to search him) commenced cutting vigorously across one of the partition planks, as closely as possible to the floor of the berth. 543958|1|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3786|It was now too late, however, to attempt getting to me before dawn, as the chief difficulty lay in passing through the close stowage in the lower hold. 544231|10|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3787|He therefore resolved to return, and wait till the next night. 544382|11|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3788|With this design, he proceeded to loosen the hatch, so that he might have as little detention as possible when he should come again. 544444|12|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3789|No sooner had he loosened it than Tiger sprang eagerly to the small opening produced, snuffed for a moment, and then uttered a long whine, scratching at the same time, as if anxious to remove the covering with his paws. 544576|13|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3790|There could be no doubt, from his behaviour, that he was aware of my being in the hold, and Augustus thought it possible that he would be able to get to me if he put him down. 544795|14|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3791|He now hit upon the expedient of sending the note, as it was especially desirable that I should make no attempt at forcing my way out at least under existing circumstances, and there could be no certainty of his getting to me himself on the morrow as he intended. 544970|15|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3792|After-events proved how fortunate it was that the idea occurred to him as it did; for, had it not been for the receipt of the note, I should undoubtedly have fAllan upon some plan, however desperate, of alarming the crew, and both our lives would most probably have been sacrificed in consequence. 545233|16|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3793|He chose to cut here, because, if suddenly interrupted, he would be able to conceal what had been done by letting the head of the mattress fall into its proper position. 545530|2|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3794|For the remainder of the day, however, no disturbance occurred, and by night he had completely divided the plank. 545699|3|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3795|It should here be observed that none of the crew occupied the forecastle as a sleeping-place, living altogether in the cabin since the mutiny, drinking the wines and feasting on the sea-stores of Captain Barnard, and giving no more heed than was absolutely necessary to the navigation of the brig. 545812|4|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3796|These circumstances proved fortunate both for myself and Augustus; for, had matters been otherwise, he would have found it impossible to reach me. 546109|5|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3797|As it was, he proceeded with confidence in his design. 546255|6|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3798|It was near daybreak, however, before he completed the second division of the board (which was about a foot above the first cut), thus making an aperture quite large enough to admit his passage through with facility to the main orlop deck. 546309|7|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3799|Having got here, he made his way with but little trouble to the lower main hatch, although in so doing he had to scramble over tiers of oil-casks piled nearly as high as the upper deck, there being barely room enough left for his body. 546548|8|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3800|Upon reaching the hatch he found that Tiger had followed him below, squeezing between two rows of the casks. 546783|9|56|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3801|Having concluded to write, the difficulty was now to procure the mate. 546891|0|57|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3803|An old toothpick was soon made into a pen; and this by means of feeling altogether, for the between-decks was as dark as pitch. 546980|2|57|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3804|Paper enough was obtained from the back of a letter–a duplicate of the forged letter from Mr. Ross. 547107|3|57|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3805|This had been the original draught; but the handwriting not being sufficiently well imitated, Augustus had written another, thrusting the first, by good fortune, into his coat-pocket, where it was now most opportunely discovered. 547206|4|57|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3806|Ink alone was thus wanting, and a substitute was immediately found for this by means of a slight incision with the pen-knife on the back of a finger just above the nail–a copious flow of blood ensuing, as usual, from wounds in that vicinity. 547435|5|57|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3807|The note was now written, as well as it could be in the dark and under the circumstances. 547676|6|57|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3808|It briefly explained that a mutiny had taken place; that Captain Barnard was set adrift; and that I might expect immediate relief as far as provisions were concerned, but must not venture upon making any disturbance. 547765|7|57|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3809|"It concluded with these words: ""I have scrawled this with blood–your life depends upon lying close"". 547981"|8|57|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3810|This slip of paper being tied upon the dog, he was now put down the hatchway, and Augustus made the best of his way back to the forecastle, where be found no reason to believe that any of the crew had been in his absence. 548081|0|58|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3811|To conceal the hole in the partition, he drove his knife in just above it, and hung up a pea-jacket which he found in the berth. 548302|1|58|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3812|His handcuffs were then replaced, and also the rope around his ankles. 548430|2|58|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3813|These arrangements were scarcely completed when Dirk Peters came below, very drunk, but in excellent humour, and bringing with him my friend's allowance of provision for the day. 548500|0|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3814|This consisted of a dozen large Irish potatoes roasted, and a pitcher of water. 548678|1|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3815|There now seemed to be two principal factions among the crew–one headed by the mate, the other by the cook. 548757|10|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3816|The former party were for seizing the first suitable vessel which should present itself, and equipping it at some of the West India Islands for a piratical cruise. 548864|11|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3817|The latter division, however, which was the stronger, and included Dirk Peters among its partisans, were bent upon pursuing the course originally laid out for the brig into the South Pacific; there either to take whale, or act otherwise, as circumstances should suggest. 549027|12|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3818|The representations of Peters, who had frequently visited these regions, had great weight, apparently, with the mutineers, wavering, as they were, between half-engendered notions of profit and pleasure. 549297|13|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3819|He dwelt on the world of novelty and amusement to be found among the innumerable islands of the Pacific, on the perfect security and freedom from all restraint to be enjoyed, but, more particularly, on the deliciousness of the climate, on the abundant means of good living, and on the voluptuous beauty of the women. 549499|14|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3820|As yet, nothing had been absolutely determined upon; but the pictures of the hybrid line-manager were taking strong hold upon the ardent imaginations of the seamen, and there was every possibility that his intentions would be finally carried into effect. 549815|15|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3821|He sat for some time on a chest by the berth, and talked freely about the mate and the general concerns of the brig. 550069|2|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3822|His demeanour was exceedingly capricious, and even grotesque. 550185|3|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3823|At one time Augustus was much alarmed by odd conduct. 550246|4|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3824|At last, however, he went on deck, muttering a promise to bring his prisoner a good dinner on the morrow. 550299|5|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3825|During the day two of the crew (harpooners) came down, accompanied by the cook, all three in nearly the last stage of intoxication. 550404|6|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3826|Like Peters, they made no scruple of talking unreservedly about their plans. 550535|7|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3827|It appeared that they were much divided among themselves as to their ultimate course, agreeing in no point, except the attack on the ship from the Cape Verd Islands, with which they were in hourly expectation of meeting. 550611|8|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3828|As far as could be ascertained, the mutiny had not been brought about altogether for the sake of booty; a private pique of the chief mate's against Captain Barnard having been the main instigation. 550831|9|59|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3829|MY name is Arthur Gordon Pym. 551028|0|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3830|My father was a respectable trader in sea-stores at Nantucket, where I was born. 551057|1|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3831|He had been on a whaling voyage with his father in the John Donaldson, and was always talking to me of his adventures in the South Pacific Ocean. 551137|10|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3832|I used frequently to go home with him, and remain all day, and sometimes all night. 551282|11|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3833|We occupied the same bed, and he would be sure to keep me awake until almost light, telling me stories of the natives of the Island of Tinian, and other places he had visited in his travels. 551365|12|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3834|At last I could not help being interested in what he said, and by degrees I felt the greatest desire to go to sea. 551555|13|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3835|I owned a sailboat called the Ariel, and worth about seventy-five dollars. 551669|14|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3836|She had a half-deck or cuddy, and was rigged sloop-fashion–I forget her tonnage, but she would hold ten persons without much crowding. 551743|15|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3837|In this boat we were in the habit of going on some of the maddest freaks in the world; and, when I now think of them, it appears to me a thousand wonders that I am alive to-day. 551877|16|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3838|My maternal grandfather was an attorney in good practice. 552054|2|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3839|He was fortunate in every thing, and had speculated very successfully in stocks of the Edgarton New Bank, as it was formerly called. 552111|3|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3840|By these and other means he had managed to lay by a tolerable sum of money. 552243|4|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3841|He was more attached to myself, I believe, than to any other person in the world, and I expected to inherit the most of his property at his death. 552318|5|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3842|He sent me, at six years of age, to the school of old Mr. Ricketts, a gentleman with only one arm and of eccentric manners–he is well known to almost every person who has visited New Bedford. 552464|6|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3843|I stayed at his school until I was sixteen, when I left him for Mr. E. Ronald's academy on the hill. 552655|7|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3844|Here I became intimate with the son of Mr. Barnard, a sea-captain, who generally sailed in the employ of Lloyd and Vredenburgh–Mr. Barnard is also very well known in New Bedford, and has many relations, I am certain, in Edgarton. 552755|8|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3845|His son was named Augustus, and he was nearly two years older than myself. 552984|9|6|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3846|The three men went away in about an hour, and no one else entered the forecastle all day. 553058|0|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3847|Augustus lay quiet until nearly night. 553147|1|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3848|In a few moments he became alarmed at the insufferable stench and the closeness of the atmosphere. 553185|10|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3849|He could not think it possible that I had survived my confinement for so long a period breathing so oppressive an air. 553283|11|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3850|He called my name repeatedly, but I made him no reply, and his apprehensions seemed thus to be confirmed. 553401|12|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3851|The brig was rolling violently, and there was so much noise in consequence, that it was useless to listen for any weak sound, such as those of my breathing or snoring. 553506|13|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3852|He threw open the lantern, and held it as high as possible, whenever an opportunity occurred, in order that, by observing the light, I might, if alive, be aware that succor was approaching. 553673|14|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3853|Still nothing was heard from me, and the supposition of my death began to assume the character of certainty. 553862|15|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3854|He determined, nevertheless, to force a passage, if possible, to the box, and at least ascertain beyond a doubt the truth of his surmises. 553970|16|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3855|He pushed on for some time in a most pitiable state of anxiety, until, at length, he found the pathway utterly blocked up, and that there was no possibility of making any farther way by the course in which he had set out. 554108|17|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3856|Overcome now by his feelings, he threw himself among the lumber in despair, and wept like a child. 554329|18|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3857|It was at this period that he heard the crash occasioned by the bottle which I had thrown down. 554427|19|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3858|He then freed himself from the rope and irons, and prepared for his attempt. 554522|2|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3859|Fortunate, indeed, was it that the incident occurred–for, upon this incident, trivial as it appears, the thread of my destiny depended. 554598|20|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3860|Many years elapsed, however, before I was aware of this fact. 554733|21|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3861|A natural shame and regret for his weakness and indecision prevented Augustus from confiding to me at once what a more intimate and unreserved communion afterward induced him to reveal. 554794|22|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3862|Upon finding his further progress in the hold impeded by obstacles which he could not overcome, he had resolved to abandon his attempt at reaching me, and return at once to the forecastle. 554979|23|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3863|Before condemning him entirely on this head, the harassing circumstances which embarrassed him should be taken into consideration. 555167|24|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3864|The night was fast wearing away, and his absence from the forecastle might be discovered; and indeed would necessarily be so, if be should fail to get back to the berth by daybreak. 555297|25|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3865|His candle was expiring in the socket, and there would be the greatest difficulty in retracing his way to the hatchway in the dark. 555478|26|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3866|It must be allowed, too, that he had every good reason to believe me dead; in which event no benefit could result to me from his reaching the box, and a world of danger would be encountered to no purpose by himself. 555609|27|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3867|He had repeatedly called, and I had made him no answer. 555824|28|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3868|I had been now eleven days and nights with no more water than that contained in the jug which he had left with me–a supply which it was not at all probable I had boarded in the beginning of my confinement, as I had every cause to expect a speedy release. 555879|29|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3869|A bottle was found in one of the berths, and this he filled with water from the pitcher left by Peters, storing his pockets at the same time with cold potatoes. 556133|3|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3870|The atmosphere of the hold, too, must have appeared to him, coming from the comparatively open air of the steerage, of a nature absolutely poisonous, and by far more intolerable than it had seemed to me upon my first taking up my quarters in the box–the hatchways at that time having been constantly open for many months previous. 556293|30|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3871|Add to these considerations that of the scene of bloodshed and terror so lately witnessed by my friend; his confinement, privations, and narrow escapes from death, together with the frail and equivocal tenure by which he still existed–circumstances all so well calculated to prostrate every energy of mind–and the reader will be easily brought, as I have been, to regard his apparent falling off in friendship and in faith with sentiments rather of sorrow than of anger. 556623|31|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3872|To his great joy he also came across a lantern, with a small piece of tallow candle in it. 557093|4|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3873|This he could light at any moment, as be had in his possession a box of phosphorus matches. 557183|5|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3874|When it was quite dark, he got through the hole in the bulkhead, having taken the precaution to arrange the bedclothes in the berth so as to convey the idea of a person covered up. 557274|6|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3875|When through, he hung up the pea-jacket on his knife, as before, to conceal the aperture–this manoeuvre being easily effected, as he did not readjust the piece of plank taken out until afterward. 557454|7|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3876|He was now on the main orlop deck, and proceeded to make his way, as before, between the upper deck and the oil-casks to the main hatchway. 557649|8|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3877|Having reached this, he lit the piece of candle, and descended, groping with extreme difficulty among the compact stowage of the hold. 557788|9|60|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3878|The crash of the bottle was distinctly heard, yet Augustus was not sure that it proceeded from the hold. 557922|0|61|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3879|The doubt, however, was sufficient inducement to persevere. 558026|1|61|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3880|Having extricated himself as quickly as possible from the labyrinth of lumber by which he was hemmed in, he at length struck into an opening which promised better, and finally, after a series of struggles, arrived at the box in a state of utter exhaustion. 558085|10|61|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3881|He clambered up nearly to the orlop deck by means of the stowage, and then, watching for a lull in the pitchings of the vessel, he called out to me in as loud a tone as he could command, regardless, for the moment, of being overheard by the crew. 558341|2|61|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3882|It will be remembered that on this occasion the voice reached me, but I was so entirely overcome by violent agitation as to be incapable of reply. 558587|3|61|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3883|Confident, now, that his worst apprehensions were well founded, be descended, with a view of getting back to the forecastle without loss of time. 558733|4|61|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3884|In his haste some small boxes were thrown down, the noise occasioned by which I heard, as will be recollected. 558878|5|61|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3885|He had made considerable progress on his return when the fall of the knife again caused him to hesitate. 558988|6|61|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3886|He retraced his steps immediately, and, clambering up the stowage a second time, called out my name, loudly as before, having watched for a lull. 559092|7|61|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3887|This time I found voice to answer. 559237|8|61|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3888|Overjoyed at discovering me to be still alive, he now resolved to brave every difficulty and danger in reaching me. 559271|9|61|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3889|The leading particulars of this narration were all that Augustus communicated to me while we remained near the box. 559386|0|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3890|It was not until afterward that he entered fully into all the details. 559501|1|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3891|At length we succeeded in reaching the hole, when Augustus got through, and Tiger was pushed in afterward. 559571|10|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3892|All was found to be safe, and we did not fail to return sincere thanks to God for our deliverance from the imminent danger we had escaped. 559677|11|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3893|For the present, it was agreed that I should remain near the opening, through which my companion could readily supply me with a part of his daily provision, and where I could have the advantages of breathing an atmosphere comparatively pure. 559815|12|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3894|He was apprehensive of being missed, and I was wild with impatience to leave my detested place of confinement. 560056|2|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3895|We resolved to make our way at once to the hole in the bulkhead, near which I was to remain for the present, while he went through to reconnoiter. 560166|3|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3896|To leave Tiger in the box was what neither of us could endure to think of, yet, how to act otherwise was the question. 560312|4|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3897|He now seemed to be perfectly quiet, and we could not even distinguish the sound of his breathing upon applying our ears closely to the box. 560430|5|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3898|I was convinced that he was dead, and determined to open the door. 560570|6|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3899|We found him lying at full length, apparently in a deep stupor, yet still alive. 560636|7|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3900|No time was to be lost, yet I could not bring myself to abandon an animal who had now been twice instrumental in saving my life, without some attempt at preserving him. 560716|8|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3901|We therefore dragged him along with us as well as we could, although with the greatest difficulty and fatigue; Augustus, during part of the time, being forced to clamber over the impediments in our way with the huge dog in his arms–a feat to which the feebleness of my frame rendered me totally inadequate. 560884|9|62|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3902|In explanation of some portions of this narrative, wherein I have spoken of the stowage of the brig, and which may appear ambiguous to some of my readers who may have seen a proper or regular stowage, I must here state that the manner in which this most important duty had been per formed on board the Grampus was a most shameful piece of neglect on the part of Captain Barnard, who was by no means as careful or as experienced a seaman as the hazardous nature of the service on which he was employed would seem necessarily to demand. 561190|0|63|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3903|A proper stowage cannot be accomplished in a careless manner, and many most disastrous accidents, even within the limits of my own experience, have arisen from neglect or ignorance in this particular. 561724|1|63|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3904|There can be no doubt either that the same result would ensue in the case of tobacco, while undergoing its usual course of fermentation, were it not for the interstices consequent upon the rotundity of the hogsheads. 561924|10|63|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3905|Coasting vessels, in the frequent hurry and bustle attendant upon taking in or discharging cargo, are the most liable to mishap from the want of a proper attention to stowage. 562140|2|63|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3906|The great point is to allow no possibility of the cargo or ballast shifting position even in the most violent rollings of the vessel. 562315|3|63|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3907|With this end, great attention must be paid, not only to the bulk taken in, but to the nature of the bulk, and whether there be a full or only a partial cargo. 562448|4|63|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3908|In most kinds of freight the stowage is accomplished by means of a screw. 562607|5|63|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3909|Thus, in a load of tobacco or flour, the whole is screwed so tightly into the hold of the vessel that the barrels or hogsheads, upon discharging, are found to be completely flattened, and take some time to regain their original shape. 562680|6|63|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3910|This screwing, however, is resorted to principally with a view of obtaining more room in the hold; for in a full load of any such commodities as flour or tobacco, there can be no danger of any shifting whatever, at least none from which inconvenience can result. 562914|7|63|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3911|There have been instances, indeed, where this method of screwing has resulted in the most lamentable consequences, arising from a cause altogether distinct from the danger attendant upon a shifting of cargo. 563176|8|63|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3912|A load of cotton, for example, tightly screwed while in certain conditions, has been known, through the expansion of its bulk, to rend a vessel asunder at sea. 563383|9|63|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3913|It is when a partial cargo is received that danger is chiefly to be apprehended from shifting, and that precautions should be always taken to guard against such misfortune. 563542|0|64|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3914|Only those who have encountered a violent gale of wind, or rather who have experienced the rolling of a vessel in a sudden calm after the gale, can form an idea of the tremendous force of the plunges, and of the consequent terrible impetus given to all loose articles in the vessel. 563714|1|64|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3915|It is then that the necessity of a cautious stowage, when there is a partial cargo, becomes obvious. 563996|2|64|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3916|When lying-to (especially with a small bead sail), a vessel which is not properly modelled in the bows is frequently thrown upon her beam-ends; this occurring even every fifteen or twenty minutes upon an average, yet without any serious consequences resulting, provided there be a proper stowage. 564096|3|64|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3917|If this, however, has not been strictly attended to, in the first of these heavy lurches the whole of the cargo tumbles over to the side of the vessel which lies upon the water, and, being thus prevented from regaining her equilibrium, as she would otherwise necessarily do, she is certain to fill in a few seconds and go down. 564392|4|64|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3918|It is not too much to say that at least one-half of the instances in which vessels have foundered in heavy gales at sea may be attributed to a shifting of cargo or of ballast. 564719|5|64|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3919|When a partial cargo of any kind is taken on board, the whole, after being first stowed as compactly as may be, should be covered with a layer of stout shifting-boards, extending completely across the vessel. 564894|0|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3920|Upon these boards strong temporary stanchions should be erected, reaching to the timbers above, and thus securing every thing in its place. 565102|1|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3921|A lamentable instance of this heedlessness occurred to my knowledge in the case of Captain Joel Rice of the schooner Firefly, which sailed from Richmond, Virginia, to Madeira, with a cargo of corn, in the year 1825. 565241|10|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3922|The captain had gone many voyages without serious accident, although he was in the habit of paying no attention whatever to his stowage, more than to secure it in the ordinary manner. 565456|11|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3923|He had never before sailed with a cargo of grain, and on this occasion had the corn thrown on board loosely, when it did not much more than half fill the vessel. 565639|12|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3924|For the first portion of the voyage he met with nothing more than light breezes; but when within a day's sail of Madeira there came on a strong gale from the N. N. E. which forced him to lie-to. 565800|13|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3925|He brought the schooner to the wind under a double-reefed foresail alone, when she rode as well as any vessel could be expected to do, and shipped not a drop of water. 565994|14|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3926|Toward night the gale somewhat abated, and she rolled with more unsteadiness than before, but still did very well, until a heavy lurch threw her upon her beam-ends to starboard. 566161|15|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3927|The corn was then heard to shift bodily, the force of the movement bursting open the main hatchway. 566338|16|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3928|The vessel went down like a shot. 566437|17|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3929|This happened within hail of a small sloop from Madeira, which picked up one of the crew (the only person saved), and which rode out the gale in perfect security, as indeed a jolly boat might have done under proper management. 566470|18|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3930|In cargoes consisting of grain, or any similar matter, additional precautions are requisite. 566696|2|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3931|A hold filled entirely with grain upon leaving port will be found not more than three fourths full upon reaching its destination–this, too, although the freight, when measured bushel by bushel by the consignee, will overrun by a vast deal (on account of the swelling of the grain) the quantity consigned. 566788|3|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3932|This result is occasioned by settling during the voyage, and is the more perceptible in proportion to the roughness of the weather experienced. 567092|4|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3933|If grain loosely thrown in a vessel, then, is ever so well secured by shifting-boards and stanchions, it will be liable to shift in a long passage so greatly as to bring about the most distressing calamities. 567235|5|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3934|To prevent these, every method should be employed before leaving port to settle the cargo as much as possible; and for this there are many contrivances, among which may be mentioned the driving of wedges into the grain. 567443|6|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3935|Even after all this is done, and unusual pains taken to secure the shifting-boards, no seaman who knows what he is about will feel altogether secure in a gale of any violence with a cargo of grain on board, and, least of all, with a partial cargo. 567662|7|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3936|Yet there are hundreds of our coasting vessels, and, it is likely, many more from the ports of Europe, which sail daily with partial cargoes, even of the most dangerous species, and without any precaution whatever. 567909|8|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3937|The wonder is that no more accidents occur than do actually happen. 568123|9|65|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3938|The stowage on board the Grampus was most clumsily done, if stowage that could be called which was little better than a promiscuous huddling together of oil-casks* and ship furniture. 568190|0|66|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3939|I have already spoken of the condition of articles in the hold. 568373|1|66|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3940|On the orlop deck there was space enough for my body (as I have stated) between the oil-casks and the upper deck; a space was left open around the main hatchway; and several other large spaces were left in the stowage. 568436|2|66|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3941|Near the hole cut through the bulkhead by Augustus there was room enough for an entire cask, and in this space I found myself comfortably situated for the present. 568654|3|66|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3942|* Whaling vessels are usually fitted with iron oil-tanks–why the Grampus was not I have never been able to ascertain. 568817|0|67|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3943|By the time my friend had got safely into the berth, and readjusted his handcuffs and the rope, it was broad daylight. 568934|0|68|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3944|We had made a narrow escape indeed; for scarcely had he arranged all matters, when the mate came below, with Dirk Peters and the cook. 569052|1|68|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3945|They talked for some time about the vessel from the Cape Verds, and seemed to be excessively anxious for her appearance. 569186|2|68|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3946|At length the cook came to the berth in which Augustus was lying, and seated himself in it near the head. 569306|3|68|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3947|I could see and hear every thing from my hiding-place, for the piece cut out had not been put back, and I was in momentary expectation that the negro would fall against the pea-jacket, which was hung up to conceal the aperture, in which case all would have been discovered, and our lives would, no doubt, have been instantly sacrificed. 569411|4|68|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3948|Our good fortune prevailed, however; and although he frequently touched it as the vessel rolled, he never pressed against it sufficiently to bring about a discovery. 569747|5|68|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3949|The bottom of the jacket had been carefully fastened to the bulkhead, so that the hole might not be seen by its swinging to one side. 569912|6|68|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3950|All this time Tiger was lying in the foot of the berth, and appeared to have recovered in some measure his faculties, for I could see him occasionally open his eyes and draw a long breath. 570045|7|68|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3951|After a few minutes the mate and cook went above, leaving Dirk Peters behind, who, as soon as they were gone, came and sat himself down in the place just occupied by the mate. 570233|0|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3952|He began to talk very sociably with Augustus, and we could now see that the greater part of his apparent intoxication, while the two others were with him, was a feint. 570408|1|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3953|His strange conduct had been brought on, no doubt, by the deleterious quality of the air of the hold, and had no connexion with canine madness. 570575|10|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3954|I could not sufficiently rejoice that I had persisted in bringing him with me from the box. 570718|11|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3955|This day was the thirtieth of June, and the thirteenth since the Grampus made sad from Nantucket. 570809|12|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3956|He answered all my companion's questions with perfect freedom; told him that he had no doubt of his father's having been picked up, as there were no less than five sail in sight just before sundown on the day he was cut adrift; and used other language of a consolatory nature, which occasioned me no less surprise than pleasure. 570906|2|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3957|Indeed, I began to entertain hopes, that through the instrumentality of Peters we might be finally enabled to regain possession of the brig, and this idea I mentioned to Augustus as soon as I found an opportunity. 571234|3|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3958|He thought the matter possible, but urged the necessity of the greatest caution in making the attempt, as the conduct of the hybrid appeared to be instigated by the most arbitrary caprice alone; and, indeed, it was difficult to say if be was at any moment of sound mind. 571447|4|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3959|Peters went upon deck in about an hour, and did not return again until noon, when he brought Augustus a plentiful supply of junk beef and pudding. 571717|5|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3960|Of this, when we were left alone, I partook heartily, without returning through the hole. 571863|6|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3961|No one else came down into the forecastle during the day, and at night, I got into Augustus' berth, where I slept soundly and sweetly until nearly daybreak, when he awakened me upon hearing a stir upon deck, and I regained my hiding-place as quickly as possible. 571952|7|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3962|When the day was fully broke, we found that Tiger had recovered his strength almost entirely, and gave no indications of hydrophobia, drinking a little water that was offered him with great apparent eagerness. 572214|8|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3963|During the day he regained all his former vigour and appetite. 572423|9|69|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3964|I will relate one of these adventures by way of introduction to a longer and more momentous narrative. 572485|0|7|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3965|One night there was a party at Mr. Barnard's, and both Augustus and myself were not a little intoxicated toward the close of it. 572587|1|7|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3966|I sprang out of bed, nevertheless, in a kind of ecstasy, and told him I was quite as brave as himself, and quite as tired as he was of lying in bed like a dog, and quite as ready for any fun or frolic as any Augustus Barnard in Nantucket. 572715|10|7|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3967|As usual, in such cases, I took part of his bed in preference to going home. 572953|2|7|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3968|He went to sleep, as I thought, very quietly (it being near one when the party broke up), and without saying a word on his favorite topic. 573029|3|7|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3969|It might have been half an hour from the time of our getting in bed, and I was just about falling into a doze, when he suddenly started up, and swore with a terrible oath that he would not go to sleep for any Arthur Pym in Christendom, when there was so glorious a breeze from the southwest. 573167|4|7|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3970|I never was so astonished in my life, not knowing what he intended, and thinking that the wines and liquors he had drunk had set him entirely beside himself. 573458|5|7|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3971|He proceeded to talk very coolly, however, saying he knew that I supposed him intoxicated, but that he was never more sober in his life. 573615|6|7|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3972|He was only tired, he added, of lying in bed on such a fine night like a dog, and was determined to get up and dress, and go out on a frolic with the boat. 573751|7|7|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3973|I can hardly tell what possessed me, but the words were no sooner out of his mouth than I felt a thrill of the greatest excitement and pleasure, and thought his mad idea one of the most delightful and most reasonable things in the world. 573906|8|7|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3974|It was blowing almost a gale, and the weather was very cold–it being late in October. 574143|9|7|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3975|On the second of July the mate came below drunk as usual, and in an excessively good-humor. 574228|0|70|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3976|He came to Augustus's berth, and, giving him a slap on the back, asked him if he thought he could behave himself if he let him loose, and whether he would promise not to be going into the cabin again. 574319|1|70|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3977|To this, of course, my friend answered in the affirmative, when the ruffian set him at liberty, after making him drink from a flask of rum which he drew from his coat-pocket. 574519|2|70|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3978|Both now went on deck, and I did not see Augustus for about three hours. 574693|3|70|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3979|He then came below with the good news that he had obtained permission to go about the brig as be pleased anywhere forward of the mainmast, and that he had been ordered to sleep, as usual, in the forecastle. 574765|4|70|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3980|He brought me, too, a good dinner, and a plentiful supply of water. 574971|5|70|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3981|The brig was still cruising for the vessel from the Cape Verds, and a sail was now in sight, which was thought to be the one in question. 575038|6|70|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3982|As the events of the ensuing eight days were of little importance, and had no direct bearing upon the main incidents of my narrative, I will here throw them into the form of a journal, as I do not wish to omit them altogether. 575175|7|70|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3985|No one came below, except my companion, during the day. 575512|2|71|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3986|Tiger took his station in the berth just by the aperture, and slept heavily, as if not yet entirely recovered from the effects of his sickness. 575567|3|71|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3987|Toward night a flaw of wind struck the brig before sail could be taken in, and very nearly capsized her. 575710|4|71|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3988|The puff died away immediately, however, and no damage was done beyond the splitting of the foretopsail. 575814|5|71|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3989|Dirk Peters treated Augustus all this day with great kindness and entered into a long conversation with him respecting the Pacific Ocean, and the islands he had visited in that region. 575918|6|71|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3990|He asked him whether be would not like to go with the mutineers on a kind of exploring and pleasure voyage in those quarters, and said that the men were gradually coming over to the mate's views. 576102|7|71|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3991|To this Augustus thought it best to reply that he would be glad to go on such an adventure, since nothing better could be done, and that any thing was preferable to a piratical life. 576297|8|71|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3993|–The vessel in sight proved to be a small brig from Liverpool, and was allowed to pass unmolested. 576486|1|72|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3994|Augustus spent most of his time on deck, with a view of obtaining all the information in his power respecting the intentions of the mutineers. 576584|2|72|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3995|They had frequent and violent quarrels among themselves, in one of which a harpooner, Jim Bonner, was thrown overboard. 576726|3|72|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3996|The party of the mate was gaining ground. 576845|4|72|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
3997|Jim Bonner belonged to the cook's gang, of which Peters was a partisan. 576886|5|72|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

3999|–About daybreak there came on a stiff breeze from the west, which at noon freshened into a gale, so that the brig could carry nothing more than her trysail and foresail. 576964|1|73|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4000|In taking in the foretopsail, Simms, one of the common hands, and belonging also to the cook's gang, fell overboard, being very much in liquor, and was drowned–no attempt being made to save him. 577133|2|73|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

4004|The brig took in a good deal of water through her seams, and one of the pumps was kept continually going, Augustus being forced to take his turn. 577604|2|74|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4005|just at twilight a large ship passed close by us, without having been discovered until within hail. 577749|3|74|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4006|The ship was supposed to be the one for which the mutineers were on the lookout. 577848|4|74|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4007|The mate hailed her, but the reply was drowned in the roaring of the gale. 577928|5|74|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4008|At eleven, a sea was shipped amidships, which tore away a great portion of the larboard bulwarks, and did some other slight damage. 578002|6|74|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4009|Toward morning the weather moderated, and at sunrise there was very little wind. 578133|7|74|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

4011|–There was a heavy swell running all this day, during which the brig, being light, rolled excessively, and many articles broke loose in the hold, as I could hear distinctly from my hiding-place. 578220|1|75|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4012|I suffered a great deal from sea-sickness. 578414|2|75|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4013|Peters had a long conversation this day with Augustus, and told him that two of his gang, Greely and Allan, had gone over to the mate, and were resolved to turn pirates. 578456|3|75|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4014|He put several questions to Augustus which he did not then exactly understand. 578625|4|75|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4015|During a part of this evening the leak gained upon the vessel; and little could be done to remedy it, as it was occasioned by the brigs straining, and taking in the water through her seams. 578703|5|75|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4016|A sail was thrummed, and got under the bows, which aided us in some measure, so that we began to gain upon the leak. 578892|6|75|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

4018|–A light breeze sprang up at sunrise from the eastward, when the mate headed the brig to the southwest, with the intention of making some of the West India islands in pursuance of his piratical designs. 579015|1|76|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4019|No opposition was made by Peters or the cook–at least none in the hearing of Augustus. 579217|2|76|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4020|All idea of taking the vessel from the Cape Verds was abandoned. 579303|3|76|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4021|The leak was now easily kept under by one pump going every three quarters of an hour. 579367|4|76|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4022|The sail was drawn from beneath the bows. 579452|5|76|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

4024|July 9. 579534|0|77|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4025|–Fine weather. 579541|1|77|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4026|All hands employed in repairing bulwarks. 579555|2|77|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4027|Peters had again a long conversation with Augustus, and spoke more plainly than he had done heretofore. 579596|3|77|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4028|He said nothing should induce him to come into the mate's views, and even hinted his intention of taking the brig out of his hands. 579699|4|77|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4029|"He asked my friend if he could depend upon his aid in such case, to which Augustus said, ""Yes,"" without hesitation. 579830"|5|77|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4030|Peters then said he would sound the others of his party upon the subject, and went away. 579945|6|77|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4031|During the remainder of the day Augustus had no opportunity of speaking with him privately. 580033|7|77|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4032|July 10. 580124|0|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4033|–Spoke a brig from Rio, bound to Norfolk. 580132|1|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4034|My friend at once assured him of his willingness to enter into any plan for that purpose, and, thinking the opportunity a favourable one, made known the fact of my being on board. 580173|10|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4035|At this the hybrid was not more astonished than delighted, as he had no reliance whatever upon Jones, whom he already considered as belonging to the party of the mate. 580352|11|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4036|They went below immediately, when Augustus called to me by name, and Peters and myself were soon made acquainted. 580519|12|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4037|It was agreed that we should attempt to retake the vessel upon the first good opportunity, leaving Jones altogether out of our councils. 580632|13|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4038|In the event of success, we were to run the brig into the first port that offered, and deliver her up. 580768|14|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4039|The desertion of his party had frustrated Peters' design of going into the Pacific–an adventure which could not be accomplished without a crew, and he depended upon either getting acquitted upon trial, on the score of insanity (which he solemnly avowed had actuated him in lending his aid to the mutiny), or upon obtaining a pardon, if found guilty, through the representations of Augustus and myself. 580870|15|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4040|"Our deliberations were interrupted for the present by the cry of, ""All hands take in sail,"" and Peters and Augustus ran up on deck. 581271"|16|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4041|Weather hazy, with a light baffling wind from the eastward. 581402|2|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4042|To-day Hartman Rogers died, having been attacked on the eighth with spasms after drinking a glass of grog. 581461|3|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4043|This man was of the cook's party, and one upon whom Peters placed his main reliance. 581567|4|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4044|He told Augustus that he believed the mate had poisoned him, and that he expected, if he did not be on the look-out, his own turn would come shortly. 581651|5|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4045|There were now only himself, Jones, and the cook belonging to his own gang–on the other side there were five. 581800|6|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4046|He had spoken to Jones about taking the command from the mate; but the project having been coolly received, he had been deterred from pressing the matter any further, or from saying any thing to the cook. 581909|7|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4047|It was well, as it happened, that he was so prudent, for in the afternoon the cook expressed his determination of siding with the mate, and went over formally to that party; while Jones took an opportunity of quarrelling with Peters, and hinted that he would let the mate know of the plan in agitation. 582113|8|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4048|There was now, evidently, no time to be lost, and Peters expressed his determination of attempting to take the vessel at all hazards, provided Augustus would lend him his aid. 582415|9|78|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4049|As usual, the crew were nearly all drunk; and, before sail could be properly taken in, a violent squall laid the brig on her beam-ends. 582590|0|79|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4050|By keeping her away, however, she righted, having shipped a good deal of water. 582725|1|79|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4051|Scarcely was everything secure, when another squall took the vessel, and immediately afterward another–no damage being done. 582804|2|79|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4052|There was every appearance of a gale of wind, which, indeed, shortly came on, with great fury, from the northward and westward. 582928|3|79|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4053|All was made as snug as possible, and we laid-to, as usual, under a close-reefed foresail. 583055|4|79|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4054|As night drew on, the wind increased in violence, with a remarkably heavy sea. 583145|5|79|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4055|Peters now came into the forecastle with Augustus, and we resumed our deliberations. 583223|6|79|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4056|We lost no time in getting on our clothes and hurrying down to the boat. 583307|0|8|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4057|She was lying at the old decayed wharf by the lumber-yard of Pankey &amp; Co., and almost thumping her side out against the rough logs. 583379|1|8|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4058|Augustus got into her and bailed her, for she was nearly half full of water. 583514|2|8|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4059|This being done, we hoisted jib and mainsail, kept full, and started boldly out to sea. 583590|3|8|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4060|We agreed that no opportunity could be more favourable than the present for carrying our designs into effect, as an attempt at such a moment would never be anticipated. 583677|0|80|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4061|As the brig was snugly laid-to, there would be no necessity of manoeuvring her until good weather, when, if we succeeded in our attempt, we might liberate one, or perhaps two of the men, to aid us in taking her into port. 583845|1|80|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4062|The main difficulty was the great disproportion in our forces. 584066|2|80|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4063|There were only three of us, and in the cabin there were nine. 584128|3|80|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4064|All the arms on board, too, were in their possession, with the exception of a pair of small pistols which Peters had concealed about his person, and the large seaman's knife which he always wore in the waistband of his pantaloons. 584190|4|80|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4065|From certain indications, too–such, for example, as there being no such thing as an axe or a handspike lying in their customary places–we began to fear that the mate had his suspicions, at least in regard to Peters, and that he would let slip no opportunity of getting rid of him. 584420|5|80|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4066|It was clear, indeed, that what we should determine to do could not be done too soon. 584700|6|80|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4067|Still the odds were too much against us to allow of our proceeding without the greatest caution. 584785|7|80|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4068|Peters proposed that he should go up on deck, and enter into conversation with the watch (Allan), when he would be able to throw him into the sea without trouble, and without making any disturbance, by seizing a good opportunity, that Augustus and myself should then come up, and endeavour to provide ourselves with some kind of weapons from the deck, and that we should then make a rush together, and secure the companion-way before any opposition could be offered. 584881|0|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4069|I objected to this, because I could not believe that the mate (who was a cunning fellow in all matters which did not affect his superstitious prejudices) would suffer himself to be so easily entrapped. 585347|1|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4070|This manoeuvre, then, is seldom resorted to in such case, unless through necessity. 585548|10|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4071|When the vessel is in a leaky condition she is often put before the wind even in the heaviest seas; for, when lying-to, her seams are sure to be greatly opened by her violent straining, and it is not so much the case when scudding. 585631|11|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4072|Often, too, it becomes necessary to scud a vessel, either when the blast is so exceedingly furious as to tear in pieces the sail which is employed with a view of bringing her head to the wind, or when, through the false modelling of the frame or other causes, this main object cannot be effected. 585862|12|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4073|The very fact of there being a watch on deck at all was sufficient proof that he was upon the alert,–it not being usual except in vessels where discipline is most rigidly enforced, to station a watch on deck when a vessel is lying-to in a gale of wind. 586158|2|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4074|As I address myself principally, if not altogether, to persons who have never been to sea, it may be as well to state the exact condition of a vessel under such circumstances. 586410|3|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4075|"Lying-to, or, in sea-parlance, ""laying-to,"" is a measure resorted to for various purposes, and effected in various manners. 586585"|4|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4076|In moderate weather it is frequently done with a view of merely bringing the vessel to a stand-still, to wait for another vessel or any similar object. 586708|5|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4077|If the vessel which lies-to is under full sail, the manoeuvre is usually accomplished by throwing round some portion of her sails, so as to let the wind take them aback, when she becomes stationary. 586859|6|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4078|But we are now speaking of lying-to in a gale of wind. 587057|7|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4079|This is done when the wind is ahead, and too violent to admit of carrying sail without danger of capsizing; and sometimes even when the wind is fair, but the sea too heavy for the vessel to be put before it. 587111|8|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4080|If a vessel be suffered to scud before the wind in a very heavy sea, much damage is usually done her by the shipping of water over her stern, and sometimes by the violent plunges she makes forward. 587318|9|81|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4081|Vessels in a gale of wind are laid-to in different manners, according to their peculiar construction. 587515|0|82|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4082|Some lie-to best under a foresail, and this, I believe, is the sail most usually employed. 587616|1|82|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4083|Large square-rigged vessels have sails for the express purpose, called storm-staysails. 587706|2|82|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4084|But the jib is occasionally employed by itself,- sometimes the jib and foresail, or a double-reefed foresail, and not unfrequently the after-sails, are made use of. 587793|3|82|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4085|Foretopsails are very often found to answer the purpose better than any other species of sail. 587957|4|82|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4086|The Grampus was generally laid-to under a close-reefed foresail. 588051|5|82|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4087|When a vessel is to be laid-to, her head is brought up to the wind just so nearly as to fill the sail under which she lies when hauled flat aft, that is, when brought diagonally across the vessel. 588115|0|83|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4088|This being done, the bows point within a few degrees of the direction from which the wind issues, and the windward bow of course receives the shock of the waves. 588311|1|83|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4089|In this situation a good vessel will ride out a very heavy gale of wind without shipping a drop of water, and without any further attention being requisite on the part of the crew. 588472|2|83|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4090|The helm is usually lashed down, but this is altogether unnecessary (except on account of the noise it makes when loose), for the rudder has no effect upon the vessel when lying-to. 588652|3|83|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4091|Indeed, the helm had far better be left loose than lashed very fast, for the rudder is apt to be torn off by heavy seas if there be no room for the helm to play. 588833|4|83|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4092|As long as the sail holds, a well modelled vessel will maintain her situation, and ride every sea, as if instinct with life and reason. 588994|5|83|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4093|If the violence of the wind, however, should tear the sail into pieces (a feat which it requires a perfect hurricane to accomplish under ordinary circumstances), there is then imminent danger. 589129|6|83|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4094|The vessel falls off from the wind, and, coming broadside to the sea, is completely at its mercy: the only resource in this case is to put her quietly before the wind, letting her scud until some other sail can be set. 589321|7|83|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4095|Some vessels will lie-to under no sail whatever, but such are not to be trusted at sea. 589539|8|83|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4096|But to return from this digression. 589626|0|84|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4097|It had never been customary with the mate to have any watch on deck when lying-to in a gale of wind, and the fact that he had now one, coupled with the circumstance of the missing axes and handspikes, fully convinced us that the crew were too well on the watch to be taken by surprise in the manner Peters had suggested. 589661|1|84|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4098|Something, however, was to be done, and that with as little delay as practicable, for there could be no doubt that a suspicion having been once entertained against Peters, he would be sacrificed upon the earliest occasion, and one would certainly be either found or made upon the breaking of the gale. 589981|2|84|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4099|Augustus now suggested that if Peters could contrive to remove, under any pretext, the piece of chain-cable which lay over the trap in the stateroom, we might possibly be able to come upon them unawares by means of the hold; but a little reflection convinced us that the vessel rolled and pitched too violently for any attempt of that nature. 590282|0|85|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4100|By good fortune I at length hit upon the idea of working upon the superstitious terrors and guilty conscience of the mate. 590624|0|86|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4101|It will be remembered that one of the crew, Hartman Rogers, had died during the morning, having been attacked two days before with spasms after drinking some spirits and water. 590746|1|86|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4102|Peters had expressed to us his opinion that this man had been poisoned by the mate, and for this belief he had reasons, so he said, which were incontrovertible, but which he could not be pre. 590922|2|86|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4103|vailed upon to explain to us–this wayward refusal being only in keeping with other points of his singular character. 591113|3|86|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4104|But whether or not he had any better grounds for suspecting the mate than we had ourselves, we were easily led to fall in with his suspicion, and determined to act accordingly. 591229|4|86|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4105|Rogers had died about eleven in the forenoon, in violent convulsions; and the corpse presented in a few minutes after death one of the most horrid and loathsome spectacles I ever remember to have seen. 591405|0|87|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4106|The stomach was swollen immensely, like that of a man who has been drowned and lain under water for many weeks. 591606|1|87|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4107|The hands were in the same condition, while the face was shrunken, shrivelled, and of a chalky whiteness, except where relieved by two or three glaring red blotches like those occasioned by the erysipelas: one of these blotches extended diagonally across the face, completely covering up an eye as if with a band of red velvet. 591717|2|87|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4108|In this disgusting condition the body had been brought up from the cabin at noon to be thrown overboard, when the mate getting a glimpse of it (for he now saw it for the first time), and being either touched with remorse for his crime or struck with terror at so horrible a sight, ordered the men to sew the body up in its hammock, and allow it the usual rites of sea-burial. 592044|3|87|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4109|Having given these directions, he went below, as if to avoid any further sight of his victim. 592419|4|87|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4110|While preparations were making to obey his orders, the gale came on with great fury, and the design was abandoned for the present. 592512|5|87|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4111|The corpse, left to itself, was washed into the larboard scuppers, where it still lay at the time of which I speak, floundering about with the furious lurches of the brig. 592642|6|87|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4112|Having arranged our plan, we set about putting it in execution as speedily as possible. 592813|0|88|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4113|Peters went upon deck, and, as he had anticipated, was immediately accosted by Allan, who appeared to be stationed more as a watch upon the forecastle than for any other purpose. 592900|1|88|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4114|The fate of this villain, however, was speedily and silently decided; for Peters, approaching him in a careless manner, as if about to address him, seized him by the throat, and, before he could utter a single cry, tossed him over the bulwarks. 593078|2|88|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4115|He then called to us, and we came up. 593322|3|88|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4116|Our first precaution was to look about for something with which to arm ourselves, and in doing this we had to proceed with great care, for it was impossible to stand on deck an instant without holding fast, and violent seas broke over the vessel at every plunge forward. 593359|4|88|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4117|It was indispensable, too, that we should be quick in our operations, for every minute we expected the mate to be up to set the pumps going, as it was evident the brig must be taking in water very fast. 593629|5|88|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4118|After searching about for some time, we could find nothing more fit for our purpose than the two pump-handles, one of which Augustus took, and I the other. 593831|6|88|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4119|Having secured these, we stripped off the shirt of the corpse and dropped the body overboard. 593986|7|88|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4120|Peters and myself then went below, leaving Augustus to watch upon deck, where he took his station just where Allan had been placed, and with his back to the cabin companionway, so that, if any of the mates gang should come up, he might suppose it was the watch. 594079|8|88|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4121|As soon as I got below I commenced disguising myself so as to represent the corpse of Rogers. 594340|0|89|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4122|The shirt which we had taken from the body aided us very much, for it was of singular form and character, and easily recognizable–a kind of smock, which the deceased wore over his other clothing. 594433|1|89|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4123|It was a blue stockinett, with large white stripes running across. 594628|2|89|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4124|Having put this on, I proceeded to equip myself with a false stomach, in imitation of the horrible deformity of the swollen corpse. 594694|3|89|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4125|This was soon effected by means of stuffing with some bedclothes. 594825|4|89|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4126|I then gave the same appearance to my hands by drawing on a pair of white woollen mittens, and filling them in with any kind of rags that offered themselves. 594890|5|89|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4127|Peters then arranged my face, first rubbing it well over with white chalk, and afterward blotching it with blood, which he took from a cut in his finger. 595047|6|89|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4128|The streak across the eye was not forgotten and presented a most shocking appearance. 595200|7|89|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4129|The wind, as I before said, blew freshly from the southwest. 595285|0|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4130|The night was very clear and cold. 595345|1|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4131|The wind, too, had suddenly increased, as we were fast getting out of the lee of the land–still I was ashamed to betray any trepidation, and for almost half an hour maintained a resolute silence. 595379|10|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4132|I could stand it no longer, however, and spoke to Augustus about the propriety of turning back. 595574|11|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4133|As before, it was nearly a minute before he made answer, or took any notice of my suggestion. 595669|12|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4134|"""By-and-by,"" said he at length–""time enough–home by-and-by"". 595762"|13|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4135|I had expected a similar reply, but there was something in the tone of these words which filled me with an indescribable feeling of dread. 595822|14|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4136|I again looked at the speaker attentively. 595960|15|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4137|His lips were perfectly livid, and his knees shook so violently together that he seemed scarcely able to stand. 596002|16|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4138|"""For God's sake, Augustus,"" I screamed, now heartily frightened, ""what ails you? 596113"|17|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4139|–what is the matter? 596193|18|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4140|"–what are you going to do""? 596213"|19|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4141|Augustus had taken the helm, and I stationed myself by the mast, on the deck of the cuddy. 596240|2|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4142|"""Matter""! 596330"|20|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4143|"he stammered, in the greatest apparent surprise, letting go the tiller at the same moment, and falling forward into the bottom of the boat–""matter–why, nothing is the–matter–going home–d-d-don't you see""? 596339"|21|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4144|The whole truth now flashed upon me. 596543|22|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4145|I flew to him and raised him up. 596579|23|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4146|He was drunk–beastly drunk–he could no longer either stand, speak or see. 596611|24|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4147|His eyes were perfectly glazed; and as I let him go in the extremity of my despair, he rolled like a mere log into the bilge-water, from which I had lifted him. 596684|25|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4148|It was evident that, during the evening, he had drunk far more than I suspected, and that his conduct in bed had been the result of a highly-concentrated state of intoxication–a state which, like madness, frequently enables the victim to imitate the outward demeanour of one in perfect possession of his senses. 596844|26|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4149|The coolness of the night air, however, had had its usual effect–the mental energy began to yield before its influence–and the confused perception which he no doubt then had of his perilous situation had assisted in hastening the catastrophe. 597155|27|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4150|He was now thoroughly insensible, and there was no probability that he would be otherwise for many hours. 597397|28|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4151|We flew along at a great rate–neither of us having said a word since casting loose from the wharf. 597502|3|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4152|I now asked my companion what course he intended to steer, and what time he thought it probable we should get back. 597600|4|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4153|"He whistled for a few minutes, and then said crustily: ""I am going to sea–you may go home if you think proper"". 597715"|5|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4154|Turning my eyes upon him, I perceived at once that, in spite of his assumed nonchalance, he was greatly agitated. 597826|6|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4155|I could see him distinctly by the light of the moon–his face was paler than any marble, and his hand shook so excessively that he could scarcely retain hold of the tiller. 597939|7|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4156|I found that something had gone wrong, and became seriously alarmed. 598110|8|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4157|At this period I knew little about the management of a boat, and was now depending entirely upon the nautical skill of my friend. 598178|9|9|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4158|As I viewed myself in a fragment of looking-glass which hung up in the cabin, and by the dim light of a kind of battle-lantern, I was so impressed with a sense of vague awe at my appearance, and at the recollection of the terrific reality which I was thus representing, that I was seized with a violent tremour, and could scarcely summon resolution to go on with my part. 598307|0|90|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4159|It was necessary, however, to act with decision, and Peters and myself went upon deck. 598678|1|90|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4160|We there found everything safe, and, keeping close to the bulwarks, the three of us crept to the cabin companion-way. 598764|0|91|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4161|It was only partially closed, precautions having been taken to prevent its being suddenly pushed to from without, by means of placing billets of wood on the upper step so as to interfere with the shutting. 598881|1|91|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4162|We found no difficulty in getting a full view of the interior of the cabin through the cracks where the hinges were placed. 599086|2|91|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4163|It now proved to have been very fortunate for us that we had not attempted to take them by surprise, for they were evidently on the alert. 599209|3|91|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4164|Only one was asleep, and he lying just at the foot of the companion-ladder, with a musket by his side. 599347|4|91|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4165|The rest were seated on several mattresses, which had been taken from the berths and thrown on the floor. 599449|5|91|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4166|They were engaged in earnest conversation; and although they had been carousing, as appeared from two empty jugs, with some tin tumblers which lay about, they were not as much intoxicated as usual. 599554|6|91|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4167|All had knives, one or two of them pistols, and a great many muskets were lying in a berth close at hand. 599751|7|91|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4168|We listened to their conversation for some time before we could make up our minds how to act, having as yet resolved on nothing determinate, except that we would attempt to paralyze their exertions, when we should attack them, by means of the apparition of Rogers. 599856|0|92|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4169|They were discussing their piratical plans, in which all we could hear distinctly was, that they would unite with the crew of a schooner Hornet, and, if possible, get the schooner herself into their possession preparatory to some attempt on a large scale, the particulars of which could not be made out by either of us. 600120|1|92|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4170|"One of the men spoke of Peters, when the mate replied to him in a low voice which could not be distinguished, and afterward added more loudly, that ""he could not understand his being so much forward with the captain's brat in the forecastle, and he thought the sooner both of them were overboard the better"". 600439"|0|93|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4171|To this no answer was made, but we could easily perceive that the hint was well received by the whole party, and more particularly by Jones. 600747|1|93|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4172|At this period I was excessively agitated, the more so as I could see that neither Augustus nor Peters could determine how to act. 600887|2|93|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4173|I made up my mind, however, to sell my life as dearly as possible, and not to suffer myself to be overcome by any feelings of trepidation. 601017|3|93|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4174|The tremendous noise made by the roaring of the wind in the rigging, and the washing of the sea over the deck, prevented us from hearing what was said, except during momentary lulls. 601155|0|94|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4175|"In one of these, we all distinctly heard the mate tell one of the men to ""go forward, have an eye upon them, for he wanted no such secret doings on board the brig"". 601337"|1|94|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4176|It was well for us that the pitching of the vessel at this moment was so violent as to prevent this order from being carried into instant execution. 601501|2|94|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4177|The cook got up from his mattress to go for us, when a tremendous lurch, which I thought would carry away the masts, threw him headlong against one of the larboard stateroom doors, bursting it open, and creating a good deal of other confusion. 601649|3|94|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4178|Luckily, neither of our party was thrown from his position, and we had time to make a precipitate retreat to the forecastle, and arrange a hurried plan of action before the messenger made his appearance, or rather before he put his head out of the companion-hatch, for he did not come on deck. 601892|4|94|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4179|From this station he could not notice the absence of Allan, and he accordingly bawled out, as if to him, repeating the orders of the mate. 602185|5|94|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4180|"Peters cried out, ""Ay, ay,"" in a disguised voice, and the cook immediately went below, without entertaining a suspicion that all was not right. 602323"|6|94|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4181|My two companions now proceeded boldly aft and down into the cabin, Peters closing the door after him in the same manner he had found it. 602466|0|95|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4182|The mate received them with feigned cordiality, and told Augustus that, since he had behaved himself so well of late, he might take up his quarters in the cabin and be one of them for the future. 602603|1|95|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4183|He then poured him out a tumbler half full of rum, and made him drink it. 602798|2|95|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4184|All this I saw and heard, for I followed my friends to the cabin as soon as the door was shut, and took up my old point of observation. 602871|3|95|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4185|I had brought with me the two pump-handles, one of which I secured near the companion-way, to be ready for use when required. 603006|4|95|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4186|I now steadied myself as well as possible so as to have a good view of all that was passing within, and endeavoured to nerve myself to the task of descending among the mutineers when Peters should make a signal to me, as agreed upon. 603131|0|96|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4187|Presently he contrived to turn the conversation upon the bloody deeds of the mutiny, and by degrees led the men to talk of the thousand superstitions which are so universally current among seamen. 603364|1|96|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4188|I could not make out all that was said, but I could plainly see the effects of the conversation in the countenances of those present. 603560|2|96|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4189|The mate was evidently much agitated, and presently, when some one mentioned the terrific appearance of Rogers' corpse, I thought he was upon the point of swooning. 603693|3|96|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4190|Peters now asked him if he did not think it would be better to have the body thrown overboard at once as it was too horrible a sight to see it floundering about in the scuppers. 603857|4|96|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4191|At this the villain absolutely gasped for breath, and turned his head slowly round upon his companions, as if imploring some one to go up and perform the task. 604034|5|96|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4192|No one, however, stirred, and it was quite evident that the whole party were wound up to the highest pitch of nervous excitement. 604193|6|96|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4193|Peters now made me the signal. 604322|7|96|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4194|I immediately threw open the door of the companion-way, and, descending, without uttering a syllable, stood erect in the midst of the party. 604352|8|96|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4195|The intense effect produced by this sudden apparition is not at all to be wondered at when the various circumstances are taken into consideration. 604492|0|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4196|Usually, in cases of a similar nature, there is left in the mind of the spectator some glimmering of doubt as to the reality of the vision before his eyes; a degree of hope, however feeble, that he is the victim of chicanery, and that the apparition is not actually a visitant from the old world of shadows. 604638|1|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4197|The four others sat for some time rooted apparently to the floor, the most pitiable objects of horror and utter despair my eyes ever encountered. 604945|10|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4198|The only opposition we experienced at all was from the cook, John Hunt, and Richard Parker; but they made but a feeble and irresolute defence. 605090|11|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4199|The two former were shot instantly by Peters, and I felled Parker with a blow on the head from the pump-handle which I had brought with me. 605232|12|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4200|In the meantime, Augustus seized one of the muskets lying on the floor now but three remaining; but by this time they had become aroused from their lethargy, and perhaps began to see that a deception had been practised upon them, for they fought with great resolution and fury, and, but for the immense muscular strength of Peters, might have the floor, stabbed him in several places along the right arm, and would no doubt have soon dispatched him (as neither Peters nor myself could immediately get rid of our own antagonists) had it not been for the timely aid of a friend, upon whose assistance we, surely, had never depended. 605371|13|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4201|This friend was no other than Tiger. 606001|14|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4202|With a low growl, he bounded into the cabin, at a most critical moment for Augustus, and throwing himself upon Jones, pinned him to the floor in an instant. 606037|15|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4203|My friend, however, was now too much injured to render us any aid whatever, and I was so encumbered with my disguise that I could do but little. 606193|16|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4204|The dog would not leave his hold upon the throat of Jones–Peters, nevertheless, was far more than a match for the two men who remained, and would, no doubt, have dispatched them sooner, had it not been for the narrow space in which he had to act, and the tremendous lurches of the vessel. 606337|17|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4205|Presently he was enabled to get hold of a heavy stool, several of which lay about the floor. 606625|18|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4206|With this he beat out the brains of Greely as he was in the act of discharging a musket at me, and immediately afterward a roll of the brig throwing him in contact with Hicks, he seized him by the throat, and, by dint of sheer strength, strangled him instantaneously. 606717|19|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4207|It is not too much to say that such remnants of doubt have been at the bottom of almost every such visitation, and that the appalling horror which has sometimes been brought about, is to be attributed, even in the cases most in point, and where most suffering has been experienced, more to a kind of anticipative horror, lest the apparition might possibly be real, than to an unwavering belief in its reality. 606984|2|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4208|Thus, in far less time than I have taken to tell it, we found ourselves masters of the brig. 607393|20|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4209|But, in the present instance, it will be seen immediately, that in the minds of the mutineers there was not even the shadow of a basis upon which to rest a doubt that the apparition of Rogers was indeed a revivification of his disgusting corpse, or at least its spiritual image. 607485|3|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4210|The isolated situation of the brig, with its entire inaccessibility on account of the gale, confined the apparently possible means of deception within such narrow and definite limits, that they must have thought themselves enabled to survey them all at a glance. 607763|4|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4211|They had now been at sea twenty-four days, without holding more than a speaking communication with any vessel whatever. 608025|5|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4212|The whole of the crew, too–at least all whom they had the most remote reason for suspecting to be on board–were assembled in the cabin, with the exception of Allan, the watch; and his gigantic stature (be was six feet six inches high) was too familiar in their eyes to permit the notion that he was the apparition before them to enter their minds even for an instant. 608144|6|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4213|Add to these considerations the awe-inspiring nature of the tempest, and that of the conversation brought about by Peters; the deep impression which the loathsomeness of the actual corpse had made in the morning upon the imaginations of the men; the excellence of the imitation in my person, and the uncertain and wavering light in which they beheld me, as the glare of the cabin lantern, swinging violently to and fro, fell dubiously and fitfully upon my figure, and there will be no reason to wonder that the deception had even more than the entire effect which we had anticipated. 608511|7|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4214|The mate sprang up from the mattress on which he was lying, and, without uttering a syllable, fell back, stone dead, upon the cabin floor, and was hurled to the leeward like a log by a heavy roll of the brig. 609094|8|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4215|Of the remaining seven, there were but three who had at first any degree of presence of mind. 609302|9|97|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4216|The only person of our opponents who was left alive was Richard Parker. 609395|0|98|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4217|This man, it will be remembered, I had knocked down with a blow from the pump-handle at the commencement of the attack. 609466|1|98|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4218|He now lay motionless by the door of the shattered stateroom; but, upon Peters touching him with his foot, he spoke, and entreated for mercy. 609585|2|98|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4219|His head was only slightly cut, and otherwise he had received no injury, having been merely stunned by the blow. 609726|3|98|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4220|He now got up, and, for the present, we secured his hands behind his back. 609838|4|98|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4221|The dog was still growling over Jones; but, upon examination, we found him completely dead, the blood issuing in a stream from a deep wound in the throat, inflicted, no doubt, by the sharp teeth of the animal. 609912|5|98|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4222|It was now about one o'clock in the morning, and the wind was still blowing tremendously. 610121|0|99|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4223|The brig evidently laboured much more than usual, and it became absolutely necessary that something should be done with a view of easing her in some measure. 610210|1|99|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4224|At almost every roll to leeward she shipped a sea, several of which came partially down into the cabin during our scuffle, the hatchway having been left open by myself when I descended. 610367|2|99|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4225|The entire range of bulwarks to larboard had been swept away, as well as the caboose, together with the jollyboat from the counter. 610552|3|99|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4226|The creaking and working of the mainmast, too, gave indication that it was nearly sprung. 610683|4|99|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4227|To make room for more stowage in the afterhold, the heel of this mast had been stepped between decks (a very reprehensible practice, occasionally resorted to by ignorant ship-builders), so that it was in imminent danger of working from its step. 610772|5|99|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']
4228|But, to crown all our difficulties, we plummed the well, and found no less than seven feet of water. 611017|6|99|The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket|1837-02-25 00:00:00|['Adventure', 'Hoax']

4231|THE BARON RITZNER VON JUNG was a noble Hungarian family, every member of which (at least as far back into antiquity as any certain records extend) was more or less remarkable for talent of some description–the majority for that species of grotesquerie in conception of which Tieck, a scion of the house, has given a vivid, although by no means the most vivid exemplifications. 611203|0|1|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4232|My acquaintance with Ritzner commenced at the magnificent Chateau Jung, into which a train of droll adventures, not to be made public, threw a place in his regard, and here, with somewhat more difficulty, a partial insight into his mental conformation. 611579|1|1|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4233|In later days this insight grew more clear, as the intimacy which had at first permitted it became more close; and when, after three years of the character of the Baron Ritzner von Jung. 611831|2|1|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4234|Sir,–My friend, M. P.-, will hand you this note. 612017|0|10|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4235|I find it incumbent upon me to request, at your earliest convenience, an explanation of this evening's occurrences at your chambers. 612065|1|10|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4236|In the event of your declining this request, Mr. P. will be happy to arrange, with any friend whom you may appoint, the steps preliminary to a meeting. 612197|2|10|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

4239|He bowed as I presented it; then, with a grave countenance, motioned me to a seat. 612433|1|15|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4240|Having perused the cartel, he wrote the following reply, which I carried to Hermann. 612515|2|15|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4241|SIR,–Through our common friend, Mr. P., I have received your note of this evening. 612599|0|16|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4242|Upon due reflection I frankly admit the propriety of the explanation you suggest. 612681|1|16|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4243|This being admitted, I still find great difficulty, (owing to the refinedly peculiar nature of our disagreement, and of the personal affront offered on my part,) in so wording what I have to say by way of apology, as to meet all the minute exigencies, and all the variable shadows, of the case. 612762|2|16|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4244|I have great reliance, however, on that extreme delicacy of discrimination, in matters appertaining to the rules of etiquette, for which you have been so long and so pre-eminently distinguished. 613056|3|16|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

4246|The nicety of your discernment in all the matters here treated, will be sufficient, I am assured, to convince you that the mere circumstance of me referring you to this admirable passage, ought to satisfy your request, as a man of honor, for explanation. 613576|5|16|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

4248|Hermann commenced the perusal of this epistle with a scowl, which, however, was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous self-complacency as he came to the rigmarole about Injuriae per applicationem, per constructionem, et per se. 613904|0|19|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4249|Having finished reading, he begged me, with the blandest of all possible smiles, to be seated, while he made reference to the treatise in question. 614138|1|19|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4250|Turning to the passage specified, he read it with great care to himself, then closed the book, and desired me, in my character of confidential acquaintance, to express to the Baron von Jung his exalted sense of his chivalrous behavior, and, in that of second, to assure him that the explanation offered was of the fullest, the most honorable, and the most unequivocally satisfactory nature. 614285|2|19|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4251|I remember the buzz of curiosity which his advent excited within the college precincts on the night of the twenty-fifth of June. 614675|0|2|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4252|"I remember still more distinctly, that while he was pronounced by all parties at first sight ""the most remarkable man in the world,"" no person made any attempt at accounting for his opinion. 614803"|1|2|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4253|About the mouth there was more to be observed. 614993|10|2|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4254|The lips were gently protruded, and rested the one upon the other, after such a fashion that it is impossible to conceive any, even the most complex, combination of human features, conveying so entirely, and so singly, the idea of unmitigated gravity, solemnity and repose. 615039|11|2|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4255|That he was unique appeared so undeniable, that it was deemed impertinent to inquire wherein the uniquity consisted. 615312|2|2|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4256|But, letting this matter pass for the present, I will merely observe that, from the first moment of his setting foot within the limits of the university, he began to exercise over the habits, manners, persons, purses, and propensities of the whole community which surrounded him, an influence the most extensive and despotic, yet at the same time the most indefinite and altogether unaccountable. 615428|3|2|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4257|"Thus the brief period of his residence at the university forms an era in its annals, and is characterized by all classes of people appertaining to it or its dependencies as ""that very extraordinary epoch forming the domination of the Baron Ritzner von Jung"". 615824"|4|2|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4258|then of no particular age, by which I mean that it was impossible to form a guess respecting his age by any data personally afforded. 616082|5|2|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4259|He might have been fifteen or fifty, and was twenty-one years and seven months. 616215|6|2|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4260|He was by no means a handsome man–perhaps the reverse. 616294|7|2|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4261|The contour of his face was somewhat angular and harsh. 616348|8|2|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4262|His forehead was lofty and very fair; his nose a snub; his eyes large, heavy, glassy, and meaningless. 616403|9|2|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4263|Somewhat amazed at all this, I made my retreat to the Baron. 616505|0|20|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4264|"He seemed to receive Hermann's amicable letter as a matter of course, and after a few words of general conversation, went to an inner room and brought out the everlasting treatise ""Duelli Lex scripta, et non; aliterque"". 616565"|1|20|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4265|He handed me the volume and asked me to look over some portion of it. 616785|2|20|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4266|I did so, but to little purpose, not being able to gather the least particle of meaning. 616854|3|20|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4267|He then took the book himself, and read me a chapter aloud. 616942|4|20|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4268|To my surprise, what he read proved to be a most horribly absurd account of a duel between two baboons. 617001|5|20|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4269|He now explained the mystery; showing that the volume, as it appeared prima facie, was written upon the plan of the nonsense verses of Du Bartas; that is to say, the language was ingeniously framed so as to present to the ear all the outward signs of intelligibility, and even of profundity, while in fact not a shadow of meaning existed. 617104|6|20|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4270|The key to the whole was found in leaving out every second and third word alternately, when there appeared a series of ludicrous quizzes upon a single combat as practised in modern times. 617442|7|20|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4271|The Baron afterwards informed me that he had purposely thrown the treatise in Hermann's way two or three weeks before the adventure, and that he was satisfied, from the general tenor of his conversation, that he had studied it with the deepest attention, and firmly believed it to be a work of unusual merit. 617629|0|21|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4272|Upon this hint he proceeded. 617937|1|21|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4273|Hermann would have died a thousand deaths rather than acknowledge his inability to understand anything and everything in the universe that had ever been written about the duello. 617965|2|21|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

4275|It will be perceived, no doubt, from what I have already said, that the Baron was one of those human anomalies now and then to be found, who make the science of mystification the study and the business of their lives. 618159|0|3|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4276|For this science a peculiar turn of mind gave him instinctively the cue, while his physical appearance afforded him unusual facilities for carrying his prospects into effect. 618376|1|3|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

4278|Nothing, at least, was done beyond eating and drinking and making merry. 618624|11|3|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4279|The apartments of the students were converted into so many pot-houses, and there was no pot-house of them all more famous or more frequented than that of the Baron. 618696|12|3|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4280|Our carousals here were many, and boisterous, and long, and never unfruitful of events. 618860|13|3|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4281|I quaintly termed the domination of the Baron Ritzner von Jung, ever rightly entered into the mystery which overshadowed his character. 618947|2|3|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4282|I truly think that no person at the university, with the exception of myself, ever suspected him to be capable of a joke, verbal or practical:–the old bull-dog at the garden-gate would sooner have been accused,–the ghost of Heraclitus,–or the wig of the Emeritus Professor of Theology. 619082|3|3|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4283|This, too, when it was evident that the most egregious and unpardonable of all conceivable tricks, whimsicalities and buffooneries were brought about, if not directly by him, at least plainly through his intermediate agency or connivance. 619367|4|3|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4284|The beauty, if I may so call it, of his art mystifique, lay in that consummate ability (resulting from an almost intuitive knowledge of human nature, and a most wonderful self-possession,) by means of which he never failed to make it appear that the drolleries he was occupied in bringing to a point, arose partly in spite, and partly in consequence of the laudable efforts he was making for their prevention, and for the preservation of the good order and dignity of Alma Mater. 619605|5|3|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4285|The deep, the poignant, the overwhelming mortification, which upon each such failure of his praise worthy endeavors, would suffuse every lineament of his countenance, left not the slightest room for doubt of his sincerity in the bosoms of even his most skeptical companions. 620084|6|3|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4286|The adroitness, too, was no less worthy of observation by which he contrived to shift the sense of the grotesque from the creator to the created–from his own person to the absurdities to which he had given rise. 620358|7|3|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4287|In no instance before that of which I speak, have I known the habitual mystific escape the natural consequence of his manoevres–an attachment of the ludicrous to his own character and person. 620569|8|3|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4288|Continually enveloped in an atmosphere of whim, my friend appeared to live only for the severities of society; and not even his own household have for a moment associated other ideas than those of the rigid and august with the memory of the Baron Ritzner von Jung. 620760|9|3|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4289|Upon one occasion we had protracted our sitting until nearly daybreak, and an unusual quantity of wine had been drunk. 621024|0|4|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4290|The company consisted of seven or eight individuals besides the Baron and myself. 621142|1|4|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4291|Most of these were young men of wealth, of high connection, of great family pride, and all alive with an exaggerated sense of honor. 621223|2|4|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4292|They abounded in the most ultra German opinions respecting the duello. 621355|3|4|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4293|To these Quixotic notions some recent Parisian publications, backed by three or four desperate and fatal conversation, during the greater part of the night, had run wild upon the all–engrossing topic of the times. 621425|4|4|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4294|The Baron, who had been unusually silent and abstracted in the earlier portion of the evening, at length seemed to be aroused from his apathy, took a leading part in the discourse, and dwelt upon the benefits, and more especially upon the beauties, of the received code of etiquette in passages of arms with an ardor, an eloquence, an impressiveness, and an affectionateness of manner, which elicited the warmest enthusiasm from his hearers in general, and absolutely staggered even myself, who well knew him to be at heart a ridiculer of those very points for which he contended, and especially to hold the entire fanfaronade of duelling etiquette in the sovereign contempt which it deserves. 621638|5|4|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4295|Looking around me during a pause in the Baron's discourse (of which my readers may gather some faint idea when I say that it bore resemblance to the fervid, chanting, monotonous, yet musical sermonic manner of Coleridge), I perceived symptoms of even more than the general interest in the countenance of one of the party. 622331|0|5|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4296|This gentleman, whom I shall call Hermann, was an original in every respect–except, perhaps, in the single particular that he was a very great fool. 622652|1|5|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4297|He contrived to bear, however, among a particular set at the university, a reputation for deep metaphysical thinking, and, I believe, for some logical talent. 622800|2|5|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4298|As a duellist he had acquired who had fAllan at his hands; but they were many. 622958|3|5|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4299|He was a man of courage undoubtedly. 623036|4|5|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4300|But it was upon his minute acquaintance with the etiquette of the duello, and the nicety of his sense of honor, that he most especially prided himself. 623072|5|5|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4301|These things were a hobby which he rode to the death. 623223|6|5|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4302|To Ritzner, ever upon the lookout for the grotesque, his peculiarities had for a long time past afforded food for mystification. 623276|7|5|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4303|Of this, however, I was not aware; although, in the present instance, I saw clearly that something of a whimsical nature was upon the tapis with my friend, and that Hermann was its especial object. 623404|8|5|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4304|As the former proceeded in his discourse, or rather monologue I perceived the excitement of the latter momently increasing. 623601|0|6|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4305|At length he spoke; offering some objection to a point insisted upon by R., and giving his reasons in detail. 623724|1|6|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4306|To these the Baron replied at length (still maintaining his exaggerated tone of sentiment) and concluding, in what I thought very bad taste, with a sarcasm and a sneer. 623833|2|6|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4307|The hobby of Hermann now took the bit in his teeth. 624001|3|6|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4308|This I could discern by the studied hair-splitting farrago of his rejoinder. 624052|4|6|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4309|His last words I distinctly remember. 624128|5|6|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4310|"""Your opinions, allow me to say, Baron von Jung, although in the main correct, are, in many nice points, discreditable to yourself and to the university of which you are a member. 624165"|6|6|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

4313|As Hermann completed this equivocal sentence, all eyes were turned upon the Baron. 624613|0|7|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4314|He became pale, then excessively red; then, dropping his pocket-handkerchief, stooped to recover it, when I caught a glimpse of his countenance, while it could be seen by no one else at the table. 624695|1|7|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4315|You will pardon me, therefore, if, upon this consideration, I deviate slightly from the general usage among gentlemen in similar cases of personal affront. 624891|10|7|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4316|You will forgive me for the moderate tax I shall make upon your imagination, and endeavor to consider, for an instant, the reflection of your person in yonder mirror as the living Mynheer Hermann himself. 625046|11|7|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4317|This being done, there will be no difficulty whatever. 625250|12|7|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

4319|It was radiant with the quizzical expression which was its natural character, but which I had never seen it assume except when we were alone together, and when he unbent himself freely. 625543|2|7|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4320|In an instant afterward he stood erect, confronting Hermann; and so total an alteration of countenance in so short a period I certainly never saw before. 625728|3|7|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4321|For a moment I even fancied that I had misconceived him, and that he was in sober earnest. 625881|4|7|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4322|He appeared to be stifling with passion, and his face was cadaverously white. 625971|5|7|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4323|For a short time he remained silent, apparently striving to master his emotion. 626048|6|7|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4324|"Having at length seemingly succeeded, he reached a decanter which stood near him, saying as he held it firmly clenched ""The language you have thought proper to employ, Mynheer Hermann, in addressing yourself to me, is objectionable in so many particulars, that I have neither temper nor time for specification. 626127"|7|7|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4325|That my opinions, however, are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman, is an observation so directly offensive as to allow me but one line of conduct. 626437|8|7|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

4327|With these words he hurled the decanter, full of wine, against the mirror which hung directly opposite Hermann; striking the reflection of his person with great precision, and of course shattering the glass into fragments. 626711|0|8|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

4333|With this answer he seemed flattered, and sat down to write a note to the Baron. 627540|10|9|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
4334|After a tiresome harangue in his ordinary style, he took down from his book shelves a number of musty volumes on the subject of the duello, and entertained me for a long time with their contents; reading aloud, and commenting earnestly as he read. 627620|2|9|Mystification|1837-06-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

5136|It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I pondered. 698288|6|1|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5137|I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth. 698400|7|1|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5138|It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down --but with a shudder even more thrilling than before --upon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant and eye-like windows. 698661|8|1|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5139|It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him. 699220|0|10|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5140|He entered, at some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady. 699353|1|10|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5141|It was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and one for which he despaired to find a remedy --a mere nervous affection, he immediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off. 699435|2|10|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5142|It displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations. 699624|3|10|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5143|Some of these, as he detailed them, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms, and the general manner of the narration had their weight. 699678|4|10|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5144|He suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odours of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did not inspire him with horror. 699831|5|10|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

5148|I dread the events of the future, not in themselves, but in their results. 700354|3|11|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5149|I shudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul. 700428|4|11|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5150|I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger, except in its absolute effect --in terror. 700552|5|11|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

5152|I learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and equivocal hints, another singular feature of his mental condition. 700825|0|12|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5153|He was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never ventured forth --in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be re-stated --an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion, had, by dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit-an effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets, and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about upon the morale of his existence. 700949|1|12|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5154|He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable origin --to the severe and long-continued illness --indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution-of a tenderly beloved sister --his sole companion for long years --his last and only relative on earth. 701551|0|13|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5155|"""Her decease,"" he said, with a bitterness which I can never forget, ""would leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last of the ancient race of the Ushers"". 701915"|1|13|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5156|While he spoke, the lady Madeline (for so was she called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. 702077|2|13|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5157|I regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread --and yet I found it impossible to account for such feelings. 702245|3|13|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5158|A sensation of stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps. 702373|4|13|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5159|When a door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother --but he had buried his face in his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears. 702450|5|13|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5160|The disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians. 702754|0|14|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5161|A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person, and frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical character, were the unusual diagnosis. 702832|1|14|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5162|Hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself finally to bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house, she succumbed (as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating power of the destroyer; and I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last I should obtain --that the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me no more. 702997|2|14|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5163|For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or myself: and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavours to alleviate the melancholy of my friend. 703474|0|15|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5164|We painted and read together; or I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar. 703651|1|15|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5165|And thus, as a closer and still intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation of gloom. 703764|2|15|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

5170|Among other things, I hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber. 704516|4|16|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5171|From the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not why; --from these paintings (vivid as their images now are before me) I would in vain endeavour to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words. 704656|5|16|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5172|By the utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs, he arrested and overawed attention. 705030|6|16|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

5174|For me at least --in the circumstances then surrounding me --there arose out of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvas, an intensity of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of Fuseli. 705186|8|16|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5175|One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although feebly, in words. 705498|0|17|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5176|A small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and without interruption or device. 705654|1|17|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5177|Certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth. 705813|2|17|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5178|No outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent, and no torch, or other artificial source of light was discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendour. 705961|3|17|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

5180|It was, perhaps, the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar, which gave birth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of his performances. 706377|1|18|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5181|But the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for. 706546|2|18|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5182|They must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as in the words of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense mental collectedness and concentration to which I have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement. 706618|3|18|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5183|The words of one of these rhapsodies I have easily remembered. 706969|4|18|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5184|I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it, as he gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning, I fancied that I perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness on the part of Usher, of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne. 707031|5|18|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

5187|A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant part of the country --a letter from him --which, in its wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other than a personal reply. 707520|2|2|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

5190|The writer spoke of acute bodily illness --of a mental disorder which oppressed him --and of an earnest desire to see me, as his best, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his malady. 707746|5|2|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5191|It was the manner in which all this, and much more, was said --it the apparent heart that went with his request --which allowed me no room for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very singular summons. 708011|6|2|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

5207|I was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties, of musical science. 709610|2|3|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5208|I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honoured as it was, had put forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain. 710036|3|3|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5209|"It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people, and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other --it was this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the ""House of Usher"" --an appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family and the family mansion. 710341"|4|3|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

5211|I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of Usher's which I mention not so much on account of its novelty, (for other men have thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it. 711325|0|31|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5212|This opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things. 711617|1|31|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5213|But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization. 711702|2|31|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5214|I lack words to express the full extent, or the earnest abandon of his persuasion. 711855|3|31|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5215|The belief, however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers. 711937|4|31|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5216|The conditions of the sentience had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stones --in the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them, and of the decayed trees which stood around --above all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn. 712054|5|31|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5217|Its evidence --the evidence of the sentience --was to be seen, he said, (and I here started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls. 712435|6|31|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5218|The result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family, and which made him what I now saw him --what he was. 712642|7|31|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

5222|One favourite volume was a small octavo edition of the Directorium Inquisitorum, by the Dominican Eymeric de Gironne; and there were passages in Pomponius Mela, about the old African Satyrs and AEgipans, over which Usher would sit dreaming for hours. 713438|2|32|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5223|His chief delight, however, was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto Gothic --the manual of a forgotten church --the Vigilae Mortuorum secundum Chorum Ecclesiae Maguntinae. 713688|3|32|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5224|I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening, having informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more, he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight, (previously to its final interment,) in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building. 713894|0|33|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5225|The worldly reason, however, assigned for this singular proceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute. 714261|1|33|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5226|The brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased, of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of the remote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family. 714380|2|33|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5227|I will not deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom I met upon the stair case, on the day of my arrival at the house, I had no desire to oppose what I regarded as at best but a harmless, and by no means an unnatural, precaution. 714660|3|33|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5228|At the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment. 714923|0|34|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5229|The body having been encoffined, we two alone bore it to its rest. 715020|1|34|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5230|The vault in which we placed it (and which had been so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation) was small, damp, and entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment. 715086|2|34|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5231|It had been used, apparently, in remote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and, in later days, as a place of deposit for powder, or some other highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor, and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it, were carefully sheathed with copper. 715443|3|34|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5232|The door, of massive iron, had been, also, similarly protected. 715769|4|34|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5233|Its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges. 715832|5|34|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5234|Having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant. 715920|0|35|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5235|A striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and Usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from which I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them. 716103|1|35|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5236|Our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead --for we could not regard her unawed. 716413|2|35|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5237|The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death. 716502|3|35|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5238|We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door of iron, made our way, with toll, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house. 716785|4|35|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5239|And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend. 716961|0|36|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5240|His ordinary manner had vanished. 717092|1|36|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5241|His ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten. 717125|2|36|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5242|He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless step. 717178|3|36|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5243|The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly hue --but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out. 717255|4|36|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5244|The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized his utterance. 717385|5|36|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5245|There were times, indeed, when I thought his unceasingly agitated mind was labouring with some oppressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage. 717534|6|36|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5246|At times, again, I was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for I beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the profoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound. 717704|7|36|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5247|It was no wonder that his condition terrified-that it infected me. 717936|8|36|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5248|I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions. 718002|9|36|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5249|It was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within the donjon, that I experienced the full power of such feelings. 718126|0|37|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5250|Sleep came not near my couch --while the hours waned and waned away. 718323|1|37|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5251|I struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me. 718391|2|37|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5252|I endeavoured to believe that much, if not all of what I felt, was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the room --of the dark and tattered draperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed. 718460|3|37|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5253|But my efforts were fruitless. 718794|4|37|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5254|An irrepressible tremour gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length, there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm. 718824|5|37|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5255|Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber, hearkened --I know not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted me --to certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence. 718961|6|37|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5256|Overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw on my clothes with haste (for I felt that I should sleep no more during the night), and endeavoured to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which I had fAllan, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment. 719304|7|37|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5257|I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention. 719611|0|38|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5258|I presently recognised it as that of Usher. 719719|1|38|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5259|In an instant afterward he rapped, with a gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. 719762|2|38|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5260|His countenance was, as usual, cadaverously wan --but, moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes --an evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanour. 719858|3|38|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5261|His air appalled me --but anything was preferable to the solitude which I had so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence as a relief. 720029|4|38|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5262|"""And you have not seen it""? 720169"|0|39|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5263|"he said abruptly, after having stared about him for some moments in silence --""you have not then seen it? 720196"|1|39|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5264|--but, stay! 720301|2|39|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5265|"you shall"". 720313"|3|39|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5266|Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open to the storm. 720324|4|39|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5267|I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment --that of looking down within the tarn --had been to deepen the first singular impression. 720451|0|4|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5268|There can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition --for why should I not so term it? 720609|1|4|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5269|--served mainly to accelerate the increase itself. 720729|2|4|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5270|Such, I have long known, is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis. 720779|3|4|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5271|And it might have been for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my mind a strange fancy --a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me. 720870|4|4|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5272|I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity-an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the gray wall, and the silent tarn --a pestilent and mystic vapour, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued. 721154|5|4|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5273|The impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet. 721561|0|40|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5274|It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty. 721632|1|40|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5275|A whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity; for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind; and the exceeding density of the clouds (which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house) did not prevent our perceiving the life-like velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other, without passing away into the distance. 721744|2|40|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5276|I say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this --yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars --nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning. 722148|3|40|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5277|But the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapour, as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion. 722321|4|40|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5278|"""You must not --you shall not behold this""! 722585"|0|41|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5279|said I, shudderingly, to Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence, from the window to a seat. 722628|1|41|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5280|"""These appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon --or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn. 722724"|2|41|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5281|Let us close this casement; --the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame. 722891|3|41|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5282|Here is one of your favourite romances. 722969|4|41|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5283|"I will read, and you shall listen; --and so we will pass away this terrible night together"". 723008"|5|41|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5284|"The antique volume which I had taken up was the ""Mad Trist"" of Sir Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favourite of Usher's more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend. 723100"|0|42|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5285|It was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of the folly which I should read. 723417|1|42|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5286|Could I have judged, indeed, by the wild over-strained air of vivacity with which he hearkened, or apparently hearkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design. 723696|2|42|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5287|I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred, the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance by force. 723912|0|43|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5288|"""And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who, in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling there-with sturdily, he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood alarumed and reverberated throughout the forest. 724127"|0|44|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5289|At the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment, paused; for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me) --it appeared to me that, from some very remote portion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly, to my ears, what might have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which Sir Launcelot had so particularly described. 724763|0|45|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5290|It was, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested or disturbed me. 725234|1|45|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5291|"And Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it, the like whereof was never before heard"". 725520"|0|49|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5292|Shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream, I scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building. 725835|0|5|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5293|Its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity. 725947|1|5|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5294|The discoloration of ages had been great. 726013|2|5|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5295|Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves. 726054|3|5|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5296|Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation. 726148|4|5|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5297|No portion of the masonry had fAllan; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the individual stones. 726207|5|5|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5298|In this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from the breath of the external air. 726391|6|5|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5299|Beyond this indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of instability. 726586|7|5|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5300|Perhaps the eye of a scrutinising observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the roof of the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn. 726682|8|5|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5301|Here again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild amazement --for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this instance, I did actually hear (although from what direction it proceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant, but harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating sound --the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon's unnatural shriek as described by the romancer. 726938|0|50|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5302|Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of the second and most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the sensitive nervousness of my companion. 727390|0|51|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5303|I was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanour. 727708|1|51|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5304|From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber; and thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly. 727883|2|51|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5305|His head had dropped upon his breast --yet I knew that he was not asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in profile. 728139|3|51|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5306|The motion of his body, too, was at variance with this idea --for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway. 728294|4|51|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5307|"""And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out of the way before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which in sooth tarried not for his full coming, but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor, with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound"". 728432"|0|52|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5308|No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than --as if a shield of brass had indeed, at the moment, fAllan heavily upon a floor of silver became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and clangorous, yet apparently muffled reverberation. 728912|0|53|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5309|Completely unnerved, I leaped to my feet; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed. 729153|1|53|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5310|I rushed to the chair in which he sat. 729254|2|53|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5311|His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity. 729292|3|53|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5312|But, as I placed my hand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and I saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if unconscious of my presence. 729399|4|53|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5313|Bending closely over him, I at length drank in the hideous import of his words. 729632|5|53|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5314|"""Not hear it? 729711"|0|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5315|--yes, I hear it, and have heard it. 729724|1|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5316|--the breaking of the hermit's door, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangour of the shield! 729760|10|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5317|--say, rather, the rending of her coffin, and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison, and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault! 729861|11|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5318|Oh whither shall I fly? 730012|12|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5319|Will she not be here anon? 730035|13|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5320|Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste? 730061|14|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5321|Have I not heard her footstep on the stair? 730108|15|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5322|Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart? 730151|16|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5323|"MADMAN""! 730217"|17|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5324|"here he sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out his syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up his soul --""MADMAN! 730225"|18|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5325|"I TELL YOU THAT SHE NOW STANDS WITHOUT THE DOOR""! 730352"|19|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5326|Long --long --long --many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard it --yet I dared not --oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am! 730401|2|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5327|--I dared not --I dared not speak! 730535|3|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5328|We have put her living in the tomb! 730569|4|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5329|Said I not that my senses were acute? 730604|5|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5330|I now tell you that I heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin. 730641|6|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5331|I heard them --many, many days ago --yet I dared not --I dared not speak! 730717|7|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5332|And now --to-night --Ethelred --ha! 730790|8|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5333|ha! 730825|9|54|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5334|As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spell --the huge antique panels to which the speaker pointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant, ponderous and ebony jaws. 730828|0|55|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5335|It was the work of the rushing gust --but then without those doors there DID stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline of Usher. 731038|1|55|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5336|There was blood upon her white robes, and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame. 731183|2|55|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5337|For a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold, then, with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother, and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to the floor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated. 731304|3|55|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5338|From that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast. 731592|0|56|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5339|The storm was still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old causeway. 731648|1|56|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5340|Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could wi have issued; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me. 731736|2|56|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5341|The radiance was that of the full, setting, and blood-red moon which now shone vividly through that once barely-discernible fissure of which I have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building, in a zigzag direction, to the base. 731909|3|56|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5342|"While I gazed, this fissure rapidly widened --there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind --the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight --my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder --there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters --and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the ""HOUSE OF USHER"". 732150"|4|56|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5343|Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house. 732555|0|6|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5344|A servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of the hall. 732620|1|6|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5345|A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master. 732701|2|6|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5346|Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know not how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken. 732845|3|6|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5347|While the objects around me --while the carvings of the ceilings, the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of the floors, and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as I strode, were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had been accustomed from my infancy --while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this --I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up. 732973|4|6|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5348|On one of the staircases, I met the physician of the family. 733426|5|6|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5349|His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity. 733486|6|6|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5350|He accosted me with trepidation and passed on. 733570|7|6|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5351|The valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master. 733616|8|6|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5352|The room in which I found myself was very large and lofty. 733695|0|7|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5353|The windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within. 733753|1|7|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5354|Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellised panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling. 733895|2|7|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5355|Dark draperies hung upon the walls. 734182|3|7|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5356|The general furniture was profuse, comfortless, antique, and tattered. 734217|4|7|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5357|Many books and musical instruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene. 734287|5|7|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5358|I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. 734388|6|7|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5359|An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all. 734435|7|7|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5360|Upon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it, I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality --of the constrained effort of the ennuye man of the world. 734508|0|8|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5361|A glance, however, at his countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity. 734759|1|8|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5362|We sat down; and for some moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of awe. 734836|2|8|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5363|Surely, man had never before so terribly altered, in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! 734949|3|8|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5364|It was with difficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood. 735043|4|8|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5365|Yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable. 735180|5|8|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5366|A cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten. 735243|6|8|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5367|And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke. 735776|7|8|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5368|The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eve, above all things startled and even awed me. 735957|8|8|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5369|The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connect its Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity. 736078|9|8|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5370|In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence --an inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy --an excessive nervous agitation. 736319|0|9|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5371|For something of this nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by his letter, than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament. 736551|1|9|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5372|His action was alternately vivacious and sullen. 736762|2|9|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5373|His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) to that species of energetic concision --that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation --that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his most intense excitement. 736810|3|9|The Fall Of The House Of Usher|1839-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5374|What say of it? 737226|0|0|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5375|what say (of) CONSCIENCE grim, That spectre in my path? 737241|1|0|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5376|Chamberlayne's Pharronida. 737296|2|0|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5377|LET me call myself, for the present, William Wilson. 737322|0|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5378|The fair page now lying before me need not be sullied with my real appellation. 737374|1|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5379|Men usually grow base by degrees. 737453|10|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5380|But my endeavours on this head were by no means uniformly successful, even when my plans were the most wittily concocted; for my namesake had much about him, in character, of that unassuming and quiet austerity which, while enjoying the poignancy of its own jokes, has no heel of Achilles in itself, and absolutely refuses to be laughed at. 737486|100|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5381|I could find, indeed, but one vulnerable point, and that, lying in a personal peculiarity, arising, perhaps, from constitutional disease, would have been spared by any antagonist less at his wit's end than myself; --my rival had a weakness in the faucal or guttural organs, which precluded him from raising his voice at any time above a very low whisper. 737826|101|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5382|Of this defect I did not fall to take what poor advantage lay in my power. 738180|102|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5383|Wilson's retaliations in kind were many; and there was one form of his practical wit that disturbed me beyond measure. 738254|103|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5384|How his sagacity first discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me, is a question I never could solve; but, having discovered, he habitually practised the annoyance. 738372|104|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5385|I had always felt aversion to my uncourtly patronymic, and its very common, if not plebeian praenomen. 738546|105|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5386|The words were venom in my ears; and when, upon the day of my arrival, a second William Wilson came also to the academy, I felt angry with him for bearing the name, and doubly disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it, who would be the cause of its twofold repetition, who would be constantly in my presence, and whose concerns, in the ordinary routine of the school business, must inevitably, on account of the detestable coincidence, be often confounded with my own. 738648|106|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5387|The feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every circumstance tending to show resemblance, moral or physical, between my rival and myself. 739125|107|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5388|I had not then discovered the remarkable fact that we were of the same age; but I saw that we were of the same height, and I perceived that we were even singularly alike in general contour of person and outline of feature. 739279|108|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5389|I was galled, too, by the rumor touching a relationship, which had grown current in the upper forms. 739501|109|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5390|From me, in an instant, all virtue dropped bodily as a mantle. 739601|11|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5391|In a word, nothing could more seriously disturb me, although I scrupulously concealed such disturbance,) than any allusion to a similarity of mind, person, or condition existing between us. 739663|110|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5392|But, in truth, I had no reason to believe that (with the exception of the matter of relationship, and in the case of Wilson himself,) this similarity had ever been made a subject of comment, or even observed at all by our schoolfellows. 739852|111|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5393|That he observed it in all its bearings, and as fixedly as I, was apparent; but that he could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of annoyance, can only be attributed, as I said before, to his more than ordinary penetration. 740088|112|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5394|His cue, which was to perfect an imitation of myself, lay both in words and in actions; and most admirably did he play his part. 740327|113|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5395|My dress it was an easy matter to copy; my gait and general manner were, without difficulty, appropriated; in spite of his constitutional defect, even my voice did not escape him. 740455|114|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5396|My louder tones were, of course, unattempted, but then the key, it was identical; and his singular whisper, it grew the very echo of my own. 740634|115|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5397|How greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me, (for it could not justly be termed a caricature,) I will not now venture to describe. 740774|116|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5398|I had but one consolation --in the fact that the imitation, apparently, was noticed by myself alone, and that I had to endure only the knowing and strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself. 740916|117|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5399|Satisfied with having produced in my bosom the intended effect, he seemed to chuckle in secret over the sting he had inflicted, and was characteristically disregardful of the public applause which the success of his witty endeavours might have so easily elicited. 741113|118|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5400|That the school, indeed, did not feel his design, perceive its accomplishment, and participate in his sneer, was, for many anxious months, a riddle I could not resolve. 741376|119|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5401|From comparatively trivial wickedness I passed, with the stride of a giant, into more than the enormities of an Elah-Gabalus. 741544|12|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5402|Perhaps the gradation of his copy rendered it not so readily perceptible; or, more possibly, I owed my security to the master air of the copyist, who, disdaining the letter, (which in a painting is all the obtuse can see,) gave but the full spirit of his original for my individual contemplation and chagrin. 741669|120|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5403|I have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of patronage which he assumed toward me, and of his frequent officious interference withy my will. 741977|121|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5404|This interference often took the ungracious character of advice; advice not openly given, but hinted or insinuated. 742134|122|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5405|I received it with a repugnance which gained strength as I grew in years. 742249|123|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5406|Yet, at this distant day, let me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that I can recall no occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the side of those errors or follies so usual to his immature age and seeming inexperience; that his moral sense, at least, if not his general talents and worldly wisdom, was far keener than my own; and that I might, to-day, have been a better, and thus a happier man, had I less frequently rejected the counsels embodied in those meaning whispers which I then but too cordially hated and too bitterly despised. 742322|124|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5407|As it was, I at length grew restive in the extreme under his distasteful supervision, and daily resented more and more openly what I considered his intolerable arrogance. 742877|125|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5408|I have said that, in the first years of our connexion as schoolmates, my feelings in regard to him might have been easily ripened into friendship: but, in the latter months of my residence at the academy, although the intrusion of his ordinary manner had, beyond doubt, in some measure, abated, my sentiments, in nearly similar proportion, partook very much of positive hatred. 743047|126|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5409|Upon one occasion he saw this, I think, and afterwards avoided, or made a show of avoiding me. 743424|127|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5410|It was about the same period, if I remember aright, that, in an altercation of violence with him, in which he was more than usually thrown off his guard, and spoke and acted with an openness of demeanor rather foreign to his nature, I discovered, or fancied I discovered, in his accent, his air, and general appearance, a something which first startled, and then deeply interested me, by bringing to mind dim visions of my earliest infancy --wild, confused and thronging memories of a time when memory herself was yet unborn. 743518|128|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5411|I cannot better describe the sensation which oppressed me than by saying that I could with difficulty shake off the belief of my having been acquainted with the being who stood before me, at some epoch very long ago --some point of the past even infinitely remote. 744043|129|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5412|What chance --what one event brought this evil thing to pass, bear with me while I relate. 744307|13|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5413|The delusion, however, faded rapidly as it came; and I mention it at all but to define the day of the last conversation I there held with my singular namesake. 744397|130|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5414|The huge old house, with its countless subdivisions, had several large chambers communicating with each other, where slept the greater number of the students. 744556|131|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5415|There were, however, (as must necessarily happen in a building so awkwardly planned,) many little nooks or recesses, the odds and ends of the structure; and these the economic ingenuity of Dr. Bransby had also fitted up as dormitories; although, being the merest closets, they were capable of accommodating but a single individual. 744714|132|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5416|One of these small apartments was occupied by Wilson. 745045|133|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5417|One night, about the close of my fifth year at the school, and immediately after the altercation just mentioned, finding every one wrapped in sleep, I arose from bed, and, lamp in hand, stole through a wilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to that of my rival. 745098|134|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5418|I had long been plotting one of those ill-natured pieces of practical wit at his expense in which I had hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful. 745370|135|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5419|It was my intention, now, to put my scheme in operation, and I resolved to make him feel the whole extent of the malice with which I was imbued. 745514|136|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5420|Having reached his closet, I noiselessly entered, leaving the lamp, with a shade over it, on the outside. 745658|137|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5421|I advanced a step, and listened to the sound of his tranquil breathing. 745763|138|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5422|Assured of his being asleep, I returned, took the light, and with it again approached the bed. 745834|139|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5423|Death approaches; and the shadow which foreruns him has thrown a softening influence over my spirit. 745928|14|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5424|Close curtains were around it, which, in the prosecution of my plan, I slowly and quietly withdrew, when the bright rays fell vividly upon the sleeper, and my eyes, at the same moment, upon his countenance. 746028|140|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5425|I looked; --and a numbness, an iciness of feeling instantly pervaded my frame. 746234|141|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5426|My breast heaved, my knees tottered, my whole spirit became possessed with an objectless yet intolerable horror. 746312|142|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5427|Gasping for breath, I lowered the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face. 746424|143|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5428|Were these --these the lineaments of William Wilson? 746501|144|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5429|I saw, indeed, that they were his, but I shook as if with a fit of the ague in fancying they were not. 746553|145|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5430|What was there about them to confound me in this manner? 746655|146|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5431|I gazed; --while my brain reeled with a multitude of incoherent thoughts. 746711|147|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5432|Not thus he appeared --assuredly not thus --in the vivacity of his waking hours. 746784|148|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5433|The same name! 746864|149|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5434|I long, in passing through the dim valley, for the sympathy --I had nearly said for the pity --of my fellow men. 746878|15|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5435|the same contour of person! 746990|150|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5436|the same day of arrival at the academy! 747017|151|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5437|And then his dogged and meaningless imitation of my gait, my voice, my habits, and my manner! 747056|152|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5438|Was it, in truth, within the bounds of human possibility, that what I now saw was the result, merely, of the habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation? 747149|153|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5439|Awe-stricken, and with a creeping shudder, I extinguished the lamp, passed silently from the chamber, and left, at once, the halls of that old academy, never to enter them again. 747304|154|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5440|After a lapse of some months, spent at home in mere idleness, I found myself a student at Eton. 747482|155|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5441|The brief interval had been sufficient to enfeeble my remembrance of the events at Dr. Bransby's, or at least to effect a material change in the nature of the feelings with which I remembered them. 747577|156|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5442|The truth --the tragedy --of the drama was no more. 747774|157|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5443|I could now find room to doubt the evidence of my senses; and seldom called up the subject at all but with wonder at extent of human credulity, and a smile at the vivid force of the imagination which I hereditarily possessed. 747825|158|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5444|Neither was this species of scepticism likely to be diminished by the character of the life I led at Eton. 748050|159|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5445|I would fain have them believe that I have been, in some measure, the slave of circumstances beyond human control. 748156|16|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5446|The vortex of thoughtless folly into which I there so immediately and so recklessly plunged, washed away all but the froth of my past hours, engulfed at once every solid or serious impression, and left to memory only the veriest levities of a former existence. 748270|160|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5447|I do not wish, however, to trace the course of my miserable profligacy here --a profligacy which set at defiance the laws, while it eluded the vigilance of the institution. 748530|161|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5448|Three years of folly, passed without profit, had but given me rooted habits of vice, and added, in a somewhat unusual degree, to my bodily stature, when, after a week of soulless dissipation, I invited a small party of the most dissolute students to a secret carousal in my chambers. 748702|162|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5449|We met at a late hour of the night; for our debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until morning. 748985|163|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5450|The wine flowed freely, and there were not wanting other and perhaps more dangerous seductions; so that the gray dawn had already faintly appeared in the east, while our delirious extravagance was at its height. 749089|164|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5451|Madly flushed with cards and intoxication, I was in the act of insisting upon a toast of more than wonted profanity, when my attention was suddenly diverted by the violent, although partial unclosing of the door of the apartment, and by the eager voice of a servant from without. 749300|165|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5452|He said that some person, apparently in great haste, demanded to speak with me in the hall. 749579|166|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5453|Wildly excited with wine, the unexpected interruption rather delighted than surprised me. 749670|167|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5454|I staggered forward at once, and a few steps brought me to the vestibule of the building. 749759|168|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5455|In this low and small room there hung no lamp; and now no light at all was admitted, save that of the exceedingly feeble dawn which made its way through the semi-circular window. 749848|169|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5456|I would wish them to seek out for me, in the details I am about to give, some little oasis of fatality amid a wilderness of error. 750026|17|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5457|As I put my foot over the threshold, I became aware of the figure of a youth about my own height, and habited in a white kerseymere morning frock, cut in the novel fashion of the one I myself wore at the moment. 750156|170|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5458|This the faint light enabled me to perceive; but the features of his face I could not distinguish. 750367|171|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5459|Upon my entering he strode hurriedly up to me, and, seizing me by. 750465|172|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5460|"the arm with a gesture of petulant impatience, whispered the words ""William Wilson""! 750531"|173|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5461|in my ear. 750615|174|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5462|I grew perfectly sober in an instant. 750625|175|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5463|There was that in the manner of the stranger, and in the tremulous shake of his uplifted finger, as he held it between my eyes and the light, which filled me with unqualified amazement; but it was not this which had so violently moved me. 750662|176|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5464|It was the pregnancy of solemn admonition in the singular, low, hissing utterance; and, above all, it was the character, the tone, the key, of those few, simple, and familiar, yet whispered syllables, which came with a thousand thronging memories of bygone days, and struck upon my soul with the shock of a galvanic battery. 750900|177|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5465|Ere I could recover the use of my senses he was gone. 751224|178|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5466|Although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my disordered imagination, yet was it evanescent as vivid. 751277|179|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5467|I would have them allow --what they cannot refrain from allowing --that, although temptation may have erewhile existed as great, man was never thus, at least, tempted before --certainly, never thus fell. 751389|18|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5468|For some weeks, indeed, I busied myself in earnest inquiry, or was wrapped in a cloud of morbid speculation. 751592|180|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5469|I did not pretend to disguise from my perception the identity of the singular individual who thus perseveringly interfered with my affairs, and harassed me with his insinuated counsel. 751700|181|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5470|But who and what was this Wilson? 751884|182|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5471|--and whence came he? 751917|183|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5472|--and what were his purposes? 751938|184|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5473|Upon neither of these points could I be satisfied; merely ascertaining, in regard to him, that a sudden accident in his family had caused his removal from Dr. Bransby's academy on the afternoon of the day in which I myself had eloped. 751967|185|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5474|But in a brief period I ceased to think upon the subject; my attention being all absorbed in a contemplated departure for Oxford. 752201|186|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5475|Thither I soon went; the uncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with an outfit and annual establishment, which would enable me to indulge at will in the luxury already so dear to my heart, --to vie in profuseness of expenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest earldoms in Great Britain. 752330|187|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5476|Excited by such appliances to vice, my constitutional temperament broke forth with redoubled ardor, and I spurned even the common restraints of decency in the mad infatuation of my revels. 752638|188|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5477|But it were absurd to pause in the detail of my extravagance. 752826|189|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5478|And is it therefore that he has never thus suffered? 752887|19|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5479|Let it suffice, that among spendthrifts I out-Heroded Herod, and that, giving name to a multitude of novel follies, I added no brief appendix to the long catalogue of vices then usual in the most dissolute university of Europe. 752939|190|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5480|It could hardly be credited, however, that I had, even here, so utterly fAllan from the gentlemanly estate, as to seek acquaintance with the vilest arts of the gambler by profession, and, having become an adept in his despicable science, to practise it habitually as a means of increasing my already enormous income at the expense of the weak-minded among my fellow-collegians. 753166|191|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5481|Such, nevertheless, was the fact. 753543|192|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5482|And the very enormity of this offence against all manly and honourable sentiment proved, beyond doubt, the main if not the sole reason of the impunity with which it was committed. 753576|193|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5483|Who, indeed, among my most abandoned associates, would not rather have disputed the clearest evidence of his senses, than have suspected of such courses, the gay, the frank, the generous William Wilson --the noblest and most commoner at Oxford --him whose follies (said his parasites) were but the follies of youth and unbridled fancy --whose errors but inimitable whim --whose darkest vice but a careless and dashing extravagance? 753755|194|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5484|I had been now two years successfully busied in this way, when there came to the university a young parvenu nobleman, Glendinning --rich, said report, as Herodes Atticus --his riches, too, as easily acquired. 754186|195|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5485|I soon found him of weak intellect, and, of course, marked him as a fitting subject for my skill. 754394|196|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5486|I frequently engaged him in play, and contrived, with the gambler's usual art, to let him win considerable sums, the more effectually to entangle him in my snares. 754491|197|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5487|At length, my schemes being ripe, I met him (with the full intention that this meeting should be final and decisive) at the chambers of a fellow-commoner, (Mr. Preston,) equally intimate with both, but who, to do him Justice, entertained not even a remote suspicion of my design. 754654|198|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5488|To give to this a better colouring, I had contrived to have assembled a party of some eight or ten, and was solicitously careful that the introduction of cards should appear accidental, and originate in the proposal of my contemplated dupe himself. 754933|199|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5489|This has been already too much an object for the scorn --for the horror --for the detestation of my race. 755181|2|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5490|Have I not indeed been living in a dream? 755286|20|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5491|To be brief upon a vile topic, none of the low finesse was omitted, so customary upon similar occasions that it is a just matter for wonder how any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim. 755327|200|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5492|We had protracted our sitting far into the night, and I had at length effected the manoeuvre of getting Glendinning as my sole antagonist. 755525|201|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5493|The game, too, was my favorite ecarte! 755663|202|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5494|The rest of the company, interested in the extent of our play, had abandoned their own cards, and were standing around us as spectators. 755701|204|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5495|The parvenu, who had been induced by my artifices in the early part of the evening, to drink deeply, now shuffled, dealt, or played, with a wild nervousness of manner for which his intoxication, I thought, might partially, but could not altogether account. 755837|205|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5496|In a very short period he had become my debtor to a large amount, when, having taken a long draught of port, he did precisely what I had been coolly anticipating --he proposed to double our already extravagant stakes. 756093|206|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5497|With a well-feigned show of reluctance, and not until after my repeated refusal had seduced him into some angry words which gave a color of pique to my compliance, did I finally comply. 756310|207|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5498|The result, of course, did but prove how entirely the prey was in my toils; in less than an hour he had quadrupled his debt. 756495|208|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5499|For some time his countenance had been losing the florid tinge lent it by the wine; but now, to my astonishment, I perceived that it had grown to a pallor truly fearful. 756619|209|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5500|And am I not now dying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest of all sublunary visions? 756788|21|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5501|I say to my astonishment. 756890|210|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5502|Glendinning had been represented to my eager inquiries as immeasurably wealthy; and the sums which he had as yet lost, although in themselves vast, could not, I supposed, very seriously annoy, much less so violently affect him. 756915|211|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5503|That he was overcome by the wine just swallowed, was the idea which most readily presented itself; and, rather with a view to the preservation of my own character in the eyes of my associates, than from any less interested motive, I was about to insist, peremptorily, upon a discontinuance of the play, when some expressions at my elbow from among the company, and an ejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of Glendinning, gave me to understand that I had effected his total ruin under circumstances which, rendering him an object for the pity of all, should have protected him from the ill offices even of a fiend. 757142|212|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5504|What now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say. 757765|213|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5505|The pitiable condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom over all; and, for some moments, a profound silence was maintained, during which I could not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many burning glances of scorn or reproach cast upon me by the less abandoned of the party. 757824|214|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5506|I will even own that an intolerable weight of anxiety was for a brief instant lifted from my bosom by the sudden and extraordinary interruption which ensued. 758119|215|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5507|The wide, heavy folding doors of the apartment were all at once thrown open, to their full extent, with a vigorous and rushing impetuosity that extinguished, as if by magic, every candle in the room. 758276|216|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5508|Their light, in dying, enabled us just to perceive that a stranger had entered, about my own height, and closely muffled in a cloak. 758475|217|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5509|The darkness, however, was now total; and we could only feel that he was standing in our midst. 758607|218|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5510|Before any one of us could recover from the extreme astonishment into which this rudeness had thrown all, we heard the voice of the intruder. 758702|219|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5511|I am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily excitable temperament has at all times rendered them remarkable; and, in my earliest infancy, I gave evidence of having fully inherited the family character. 758843|22|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5512|"""Gentlemen,"" he said, in a low, distinct, and never-to-be-forgotten whisper which thrilled to the very marrow of my bones, ""Gentlemen, I make no apology for this behaviour, because in thus behaving, I am but fulfilling a duty. 759059"|220|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5513|You are, beyond doubt, uninformed of the true character of the person who has to-night won at ecarte a large sum of money from Lord Glendinning. 759285|221|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5514|I will therefore put you upon an expeditious and decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary information. 759429|222|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5515|"Please to examine, at your leisure, the inner linings of the cuff of his left sleeve, and the several little packages which may be found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered morning wrapper"". 759537"|223|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5516|While he spoke, so profound was the stillness that one might have heard a pin drop upon the floor. 759744|224|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5517|In ceasing, he departed at once, and as abruptly as he had entered. 759842|225|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5518|Can I --shall I describe my sensations? 759909|226|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5519|--must I say that I felt all the horrors of the damned? 759948|227|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5520|Most assuredly I had little time given for reflection. 760003|228|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5521|Many hands roughly seized me upon the spot, and lights were immediately reprocured. 760057|229|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5522|As I advanced in years it was more strongly developed; becoming, for many reasons, a cause of serious disquietude to my friends, and of positive injury to myself. 760140|23|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5523|A search ensued. 760302|230|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5524|In the lining of my sleeve were found all the court cards essential in ecarte, and, in the pockets of my wrapper, a number of packs, facsimiles of those used at our sittings, with the single exception that mine were of the species called, technically, arrondees; the honours being slightly convex at the ends, the lower cards slightly convex at the sides. 760318|231|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5525|In this disposition, the dupe who cuts, as customary, at the length of the pack, will invariably find that he cuts his antagonist an honor; while the gambler, cutting at the breadth, will, as certainly, cut nothing for his victim which may count in the records of the game. 760673|232|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5526|Any burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected me less than the silent contempt, or the sarcastic composure, with which it was received. 760946|233|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5527|"""Mr. Wilson,"" said our host, stooping to remove from beneath his feet an exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs, ""Mr. Wilson, this is your property"". 761100"|234|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5528|(The weather was cold; and, upon quitting my own room, I had thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper, putting it off upon reaching the scene of play. 761251|235|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5529|") ""I presume it is supererogatory to seek here (eyeing the folds of the garment with a bitter smile) for any farther evidence of your skill. 761400"|236|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5530|Indeed, we have had enough. 761540|237|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5531|"You will see the necessity, I hope, of quitting Oxford --at all events, of quitting instantly my chambers"". 761567"|238|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5532|Abased, humbled to the dust as I then was, it is probable that I should have resented this galling language by immediate personal violence, had not my whole attention been at the moment arrested by a fact of the most startling character. 761674|239|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5533|I grew self-willed, addicted to the wildest caprices, and a prey to the most ungovernable passions. 761911|24|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5534|The cloak which I had worn was of a rare description of fur; how rare, how extravagantly costly, I shall not venture to say. 762010|240|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5535|Its fashion, too, was of my own fantastic invention; for I was fastidious to an absurd degree of coxcombry, in matters of this frivolous nature. 762134|241|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5536|When, therefore, Mr. Preston reached me that which he had picked up upon the floor, and near the folding doors of the apartment, it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon terror, that I perceived my own already hanging on my arm, (where I had no doubt unwittingly placed it,) and that the one presented me was but its exact counterpart in every, in even the minutest possible particular. 762278|242|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5537|The singular being who had so disastrously exposed me, had been muffled, I remembered, in a cloak; and none had been worn at all by any of the members of our party with the exception of myself. 762673|243|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5538|Retaining some presence of mind, I took the one offered me by Preston; placed it, unnoticed, over my own; left the apartment with a resolute scowl of defiance; and, next morning ere dawn of day, commenced a hurried journey from Oxford to the continent, in a perfect agony of horror and of shame. 762866|244|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5539|I fled in vain. 763161|245|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5540|My evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation, and proved, indeed, that the exercise of its mysterious dominion had as yet only begun. 763176|246|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5541|Scarcely had I set foot in Paris ere I had fresh evidence of the detestable interest taken by this Wilson in my concerns. 763311|247|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5542|Years flew, while I experienced no relief. 763432|248|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5543|Villain! 763474|249|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5544|Weak-minded, and beset with constitutional infirmities akin to my own, my parents could do but little to check the evil propensities which distinguished me. 763482|25|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5545|--at Rome, with how untimely, yet with how spectral an officiousness, stepped he in between me and my ambition! 763638|250|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5546|At Vienna, too --at Berlin --and at Moscow! 763749|251|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5547|Where, in truth, had I not bitter cause to curse him within my heart? 763792|252|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5548|From his inscrutable tyranny did I at length flee, panic-stricken, as from a pestilence; and to the very ends of the earth I fled in vain. 763861|253|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5549|"And again, and again, in secret communion with my own spirit, would I demand the questions ""Who is he? 763999"|254|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5550|--whence came he? 764101|255|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5551|"--and what are his objects""? 764118"|256|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5552|But no answer was there found. 764146|257|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5553|And then I scrutinized, with a minute scrutiny, the forms, and the methods, and the leading traits of his impertinent supervision. 764176|258|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5554|But even here there was very little upon which to base a conjecture. 764306|259|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5555|Some feeble and ill-directed efforts resulted in complete failure on their part, and, of course, in total triumph on mine. 764374|26|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5556|It was noticeable, indeed, that, in no one of the multiplied instances in which he had of late crossed my path, had he so crossed it except to frustrate those schemes, or to disturb those actions, which, if fully carried out, might have resulted in bitter mischief. 764496|260|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5557|Poor justification this, in truth, for an authority so imperiously assumed! 764761|261|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5558|Poor indemnity for natural rights of self-agency so pertinaciously, so insultingly denied! 764836|262|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5559|I had also been forced to notice that my tormentor, for a very long period of time, (while scrupulously and with miraculous dexterity maintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with myself,) had so contrived it, in the execution of his varied interference with my will, that I saw not, at any moment, the features of his face. 764926|263|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5560|Be Wilson what he might, this, at least, was but the veriest of affectation, or of folly. 765256|264|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5561|Could he, for an instant, have supposed that, in my admonisher at Eton --in the destroyer of my honor at Oxford, --in him who thwarted my ambition at Rome, my revenge at Paris, my passionate love at Naples, or what he falsely termed my avarice in Egypt, --that in this, my arch-enemy and evil genius, could fall to recognise the William Wilson of my school boy days, --the namesake, the companion, the rival, --the hated and dreaded rival at Dr. Bransby's? 765345|265|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5562|Impossible! 765801|266|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5563|--But let me hasten to the last eventful scene of the drama. 765812|267|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5564|Thus far I had succumbed supinely to this imperious domination. 765872|268|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5565|The sentiment of deep awe with which I habitually regarded the elevated character, the majestic wisdom, the apparent omnipresence and omnipotence of Wilson, added to a feeling of even terror, with which certain other traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me, had operated, hitherto, to impress me with an idea of my own utter weakness and helplessness, and to suggest an implicit, although bitterly reluctant submission to his arbitrary will. 765935|269|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5566|Thenceforward my voice was a household law; and at an age when few children have abandoned their leading-strings, I was left to the guidance of my own will, and became, in all but name, the master of my own actions. 766385|27|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5567|But, of late days, I had given myself up entirely to wine; and its maddening influence upon my hereditary temper rendered me more and more impatient of control. 766600|270|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5568|I began to murmur, --to hesitate, --to resist. 766760|271|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5569|And was it only fancy which induced me to believe that, with the increase of my own firmness, that of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution? 766806|272|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5570|Be this as it may, I now began to feel the inspiration of a burning hope, and at length nurtured in my secret thoughts a stern and desperate resolution that I would submit no longer to be enslaved. 766957|273|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5571|It was at Rome, during the Carnival of 18--, that I attended a masquerade in the palazzo of the Neapolitan Duke Di Broglio. 767154|274|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5572|I had indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the wine-table; and now the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms irritated me beyond endurance. 767277|275|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5573|The difficulty, too, of forcing my way through the mazes of the company contributed not a little to the ruffling of my temper; for I was anxiously seeking, (let me not say with what unworthy motive) the young, the gay, the beautiful wife of the aged and doting Di Broglio. 767436|276|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5574|With a too unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to me the secret of the costume in which she would be habited, and now, having caught a glimpse of her person, I was hurrying to make my way into her presence. 767708|277|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5575|--At this moment I felt a light hand placed upon my shoulder, and that ever-remembered, low, damnable whisper within my ear. 767934|278|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5576|In an absolute phrenzy of wrath, I turned at once upon him who had thus interrupted me, and seized him violently by tile collar. 768058|279|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5577|My earliest recollections of a school-life, are connected with a large, rambling, Elizabethan house, in a misty-looking village of England, where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees, and where all the houses were excessively ancient. 768186|28|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5578|He was attired, as I had expected, in a costume altogether similar to my own; wearing a Spanish cloak of blue velvet, begirt about the waist with a crimson belt sustaining a rapier. 768432|280|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5579|A mask of black silk entirely covered his face. 768613|281|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5580|"""Scoundrel""! 768660"|282|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5581|"I said, in a voice husky with rage, while every syllable I uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury, ""scoundrel! 768672"|283|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5582|impostor! 768781|284|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5583|accursed villain! 768790|285|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5584|you shall not --you shall not dog me unto death! 768807|286|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5585|"Follow me, or I stab you where you stand""! 768855"|287|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5586|--and I broke my way from the ball-room into a small ante-chamber adjoining --dragging him unresistingly with me as I went. 768897|288|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5587|Upon entering, I thrust him furiously from me. 769020|289|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5588|In truth, it was a dream-like and spirit-soothing place, that venerable old town. 769066|29|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5589|He staggered against the wall, while I closed the door with an oath, and commanded him to draw. 769147|290|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5590|He hesitated but for an instant; then, with a slight sigh, drew in silence, and put himself upon his defence. 769242|291|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5591|The contest was brief indeed. 769351|292|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5592|I was frantic with every species of wild excitement, and felt within my single arm the energy and power of a multitude. 769380|293|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5593|In a few seconds I forced him by sheer strength against the wainscoting, and thus, getting him at mercy, plunged my sword, with brute ferocity, repeatedly through and through his bosom. 769499|294|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5594|At that instant some person tried the latch of the door. 769684|295|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5595|I hastened to prevent an intrusion, and then immediately returned to my dying antagonist. 769740|296|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5596|But what human language can adequately portray that astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then presented to view? 769829|297|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5597|The brief moment in which I averted my eyes had been sufficient to produce, apparently, a material change in the arrangements at the upper or farther end of the room. 769966|298|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5598|A large mirror, --so at first it seemed to me in my confusion --now stood where none had been perceptible before; and, as I stepped up to it in extremity of terror, mine own image, but with features all pale and dabbled in blood, advanced to meet me with a feeble and tottering gait. 770132|299|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5599|To the uttermost regions of the globe have not the indignant winds bruited its unparalleled infamy? 770415|3|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5600|At this moment, in fancy, I feel the refreshing chilliness of its deeply-shadowed avenues, inhale the fragrance of its thousand shrubberies, and thrill anew with undefinable delight, at the deep hollow note of the church-bell, breaking, each hour, with sullen and sudden roar, upon the stillness of the dusky atmosphere in which the fretted Gothic steeple lay imbedded and asleep. 770514|30|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5601|Thus it appeared, I say, but was not. 770894|300|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5602|It was my antagonist --it was Wilson, who then stood before me in the agonies of his dissolution. 770931|301|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5603|His mask and cloak lay, where he had thrown them, upon the floor. 771028|302|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5604|Not a thread in all his raiment --not a line in all the marked and singular lineaments of his face which was not, even in the most absolute identity, mine own! 771093|303|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5605|"It was Wilson; but he spoke no longer in a whisper, and I could have fancied that I myself was speaking while he said: ""You have conquered, and I yield. 771252"|304|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5606|Yet, henceforward art thou also dead --dead to the World, to Heaven and to Hope! 771404|305|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5607|"In me didst thou exist --and, in my death, see by this image, which is thine own, how utterly thou hast murdered thyself"". 771484"|306|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5608|It gives me, perhaps, as much of pleasure as I can now in any manner experience, to dwell upon minute recollections of the school and its concerns. 771606|31|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5609|Steeped in misery as I am --misery, alas! 771753|32|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5610|only too real --I shall be pardoned for seeking relief, however slight and temporary, in the weakness of a few rambling details. 771794|33|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5611|These, moreover, utterly trivial, and even ridiculous in themselves, assume, to my fancy, adventitious importance, as connected with a period and a locality when and where I recognise the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which afterwards so fully overshadowed me. 771922|34|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5612|Let me then remember. 772193|35|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5613|The house, I have said, was old and irregular. 772214|36|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5614|The grounds were extensive, and a high and solid brick wall, topped with a bed of mortar and broken glass, encompassed the whole. 772260|37|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5615|This prison-like rampart formed the limit of our domain; beyond it we saw but thrice a week --once every Saturday afternoon, when, attended by two ushers, we were permitted to take brief walks in a body through some of the neighbouring fields --and twice during Sunday, when we were paraded in the same formal manner to the morning and evening service in the one church of the village. 772389|38|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5616|Of this church the principal of our school was pastor. 772774|39|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5617|Oh, outcast of all outcasts most abandoned! 772828|4|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5618|With how deep a spirit of wonder and perplexity was I wont to regard him from our remote pew in the gallery, as, with step solemn and slow, he ascended the pulpit! 772871|40|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5619|This reverend man, with countenance so demurely benign, with robes so glossy and so clerically flowing, with wig so minutely powdered, so rigid and so vast, ---could this be he who, of late, with sour visage, and in snuffy habiliments, administered, ferule in hand, the Draconian laws of the academy? 773034|41|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5620|Oh, gigantic paradox, too utterly monstrous for solution! 773334|42|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5621|At an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate. 773391|43|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5622|It was riveted and studded with iron bolts, and surmounted with jagged iron spikes. 773455|44|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5623|What impressions of deep awe did it inspire! 773538|45|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5624|It was never opened save for the three periodical egressions and ingressions already mentioned; then, in every creak of its mighty hinges, we found a plenitude of mystery --a world of matter for solemn remark, or for more solemn meditation. 773582|46|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5625|The extensive enclosure was irregular in form, having many capacious recesses. 773822|47|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5626|Of these, three or four of the largest constituted the play-ground. 773900|48|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5627|It was level, and covered with fine hard gravel. 773967|49|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5628|--to the earth art thou not forever dead? 774015|5|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5629|I well remember it had no trees, nor benches, nor anything similar within it. 774056|50|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5630|Of course it was in the rear of the house. 774133|51|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5631|In front lay a small parterre, planted with box and other shrubs; but through this sacred division we passed only upon rare occasions indeed --such as a first advent to school or final departure thence, or perhaps, when a parent or friend having called for us, we joyfully took our way home for the Christmas or Midsummer holy-days. 774175|52|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5632|But the house! 774507|53|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5633|--how quaint an old building was this! 774521|54|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5634|--to me how veritably a palace of enchantment! 774559|55|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5635|There was really no end to its windings --to its incomprehensible subdivisions. 774605|56|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5636|It was difficult, at any given time, to say with certainty upon which of its two stories one happened to be. 774684|57|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5637|From each room to every other there were sure to be found three or four steps either in ascent or descent. 774792|58|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5638|Then the lateral branches were innumerable --inconceivable --and so returning in upon themselves, that our most exact ideas in regard to the whole mansion were not very far different from those with which we pondered upon infinity. 774898|59|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5639|to its honors, to its flowers, to its golden aspirations? 775129|6|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5640|During the five years of my residence here, I was never able to ascertain with precision, in what remote locality lay the little sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or twenty other scholars. 775186|60|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5641|The school-room was the largest in the house --I could not help thinking, in the world. 775396|61|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5642|It was very long, narrow, and dismally low, with pointed Gothic windows and a celling of oak. 775483|62|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5643|"In a remote and terror-inspiring angle was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet, comprising the sanctum, ""during hours,"" of our principal, the Reverend Dr. Bransby. 775576"|63|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5644|"It was a solid structure, with massy door, sooner than open which in the absence of the ""Dominic,"" we would all have willingly perished by the peine forte et dure. 775743"|64|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5645|In other angles were two other similar boxes, far less reverenced, indeed, but still greatly matters of awe. 775906|65|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5646|"One of these was the pulpit of the ""classical"" usher, one of the ""English and mathematical"". 776014"|66|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5647|Interspersed about the room, crossing and recrossing in endless irregularity, were innumerable benches and desks, black, ancient, and time-worn, piled desperately with much-bethumbed books, and so beseamed with initial letters, names at full length, grotesque figures, and other multiplied efforts of the knife, as to have entirely lost what little of original form might have been their portion in days long departed. 776106|67|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5648|A huge bucket with water stood at one extremity of the room, and a clock of stupendous dimensions at the other. 776524|68|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5649|Encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy, I passed, yet not in tedium or disgust, the years of the third lustrum of my life. 776635|69|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5650|--and a cloud, dense, dismal, and limitless, does it not hang eternally between thy hopes and heaven? 776775|7|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5651|The teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident to occupy or amuse it; and the apparently dismal monotony of a school was replete with more intense excitement than my riper youth has derived from luxury, or my full manhood from crime. 776876|70|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5652|Yet I must believe that my first mental development had in it much of the uncommon --even much of the outre. 777132|71|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5653|Upon mankind at large the events of very early existence rarely leave in mature age any definite impression. 777240|72|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5654|All is gray shadow --a weak and irregular remembrance --an indistinct regathering of feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains. 777348|73|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5655|With me this is not so. 777475|74|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5656|In childhood I must have felt with the energy of a man what I now find stamped upon memory in lines as vivid, as deep, and as durable as the exergues of the Carthaginian medals. 777498|75|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5657|Yet in fact --in the fact of the world's view --how little was there to remember! 777675|76|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5658|The morning's awakening, the nightly summons to bed; the connings, the recitations; the periodical half-holidays, and perambulations; the play-ground, with its broils, its pastimes, its intrigues; --these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made to involve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, an universe of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and spirit-stirring. 777756|77|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5659|"""Oh, le bon temps, que ce siecle de fer""! 778157"|78|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5660|In truth, the ardor, the enthusiasm, and the imperiousness of my disposition, soon rendered me a marked character among my schoolmates, and by slow, but natural gradations, gave me an ascendancy over all not greatly older than myself; --over all with a single exception. 778198|79|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5661|I would not, if I could, here or to-day, embody a record of my later years of unspeakable misery, and unpardonable crime. 778468|8|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5662|This exception was found in the person of a scholar, who, although no relation, bore the same Christian and surname as myself; --a circumstance, in fact, little remarkable; for, notwithstanding a noble descent, mine was one of those everyday appellations which seem, by prescriptive right, to have been, time out of mind, the common property of the mob. 778589|80|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5663|In this narrative I have therefore designated myself as William Wilson, --a fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real. 778942|81|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5664|"My namesake alone, of those who in school phraseology constituted ""our set,"" presumed to compete with me in the studies of the class --in the sports and broils of the play-ground --to refuse implicit belief in my assertions, and submission to my will --indeed, to interfere with my arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever. 779067"|82|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5665|If there is on earth a supreme and unqualified despotism, it is the despotism of a master mind in boyhood over the less energetic spirits of its companions. 779395|83|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5666|Wilson's rebellion was to me a source of the greatest embarrassment; --the more so as, in spite of the bravado with which in public I made a point of treating him and his pretensions, I secretly felt that I feared him, and could not help thinking the equality which he maintained so easily with myself, a proof of his true superiority; since not to be overcome cost me a perpetual struggle. 779551|84|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5667|Yet this superiority --even this equality --was in truth acknowledged by no one but myself; our associates, by some unaccountable blindness, seemed not even to suspect it. 779941|85|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5668|Indeed, his competition, his resistance, and especially his impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes, were not more pointed than private. 780112|86|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5669|He appeared to be destitute alike of the ambition which urged, and of the passionate energy of mind which enabled me to excel. 780261|87|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5670|In his rivalry he might have been supposed actuated solely by a whimsical desire to thwart, astonish, or mortify myself; although there were times when I could not help observing, with a feeling made up of wonder, abasement, and pique, that he mingled with his injuries, his insults, or his contradictions, a certain most inappropriate, and assuredly most unwelcome affectionateness of manner. 780387|88|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5671|I could only conceive this singular behavior to arise from a consummate self-conceit assuming the vulgar airs of patronage and protection. 780780|89|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5672|This epoch --these later years --took unto themselves a sudden elevation in turpitude, whose origin alone it is my present purpose to assign. 780918|9|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5673|Perhaps it was this latter trait in Wilson's conduct, conjoined with our identity of name, and the mere accident of our having entered the school upon the same day, which set afloat the notion that we were brothers, among the senior classes in the academy. 781059|90|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5674|These do not usually inquire with much strictness into the affairs of their juniors. 781315|91|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5675|I have before said, or should have said, that Wilson was not, in the most remote degree, connected with my family. 781399|92|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5676|But assuredly if we had been brothers we must have been twins; for, after leaving Dr. Bransby's, I casually learned that my namesake was born on the nineteenth of January, 1813 --and this is a somewhat remarkable coincidence; for the day is precisely that of my own nativity. 781513|93|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5677|It may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned me by the rivalry of Wilson, and his intolerable spirit of contradiction, I could not bring myself to hate him altogether. 781788|94|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5678|"We had, to be sure, nearly every day a quarrel in which, yielding me publicly the palm of victory, he, in some manner, contrived to make me feel that it was he who had deserved it; yet a sense of pride on my part, and a veritable dignity on his own, kept us always upon what are called ""speaking terms,"" while there were many points of strong congeniality in our tempers, operating to awake me in a sentiment which our position alone, perhaps, prevented from ripening into friendship. 781980"|95|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5679|It is difficult, indeed, to define,or even to describe, my real feelings towards him. 782464|96|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5680|They formed a motley and heterogeneous admixture; --some petulant animosity, which was not yet hatred, some esteem, more respect, much fear, with a world of uneasy curiosity. 782549|97|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5681|To the moralist it will be unnecessary to say, in addition, that Wilson and myself were the most inseparable of companions. 782723|98|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
5682|It was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between us, which turned all my attacks upon him, (and they were many, either open or covert) into the channel of banter or practical joke (giving pain while assuming the aspect of mere fun) rather than into a more serious and determined hostility. 782846|99|1|William Wilson|1839-10-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

5720|That among them we should look for the agency of the threatened fiery destruction had been for many years considered an inadmissible idea. 785512|8|16|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5721|But wonders and wild fancies had been, of late days, strangely rife among mankind; and although it was only with a few of the ignorant that actual apprehension prevailed, upon the announcement by astronomers of a new comet, yet this announcement was generally received with I know not what of agitation and mistrust. 785650|9|16|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5722|The elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated, and it was at once conceded by all observers, that its path, at perihelion, would bring it into very close proximity with the earth. 785966|0|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5723|There were two or three astronomers, of secondary note, who resolutely maintained that a contact was inevitable. 786159|1|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5724|Even the grossly ignorant aroused their sluggish capacities to such considerations. 786271|10|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5725|The learned now gave their intellect; their soul; to no such points as the allaying of fear, or to the sustenance of loved theory. 786354|11|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5726|They sought- they panted for right views. 786484|12|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5727|They groaned for perfected knowledge. 786525|13|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5728|Truth arose in the purity of her strength and exceeding majesty, and the wise bowed down and adored. 786562|14|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5729|I cannot very well express to you the effect of this intelligence upon the people. 786662|2|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5730|For a few short days they would not believe an assertion which their intellect, so long employed among worldly considerations, could not in any manner grasp. 786744|3|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5731|But the truth of a vitally important fact soon makes its way into the understanding of even the most stolid. 786901|4|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5732|Finally, all men saw that astronomical knowledge lied not, and they awaited the comet. 787009|5|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5733|Its approach was not, at first, seemingly rapid; nor was its appearance of very unusual character. 787095|6|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5734|It was of a dull red, and had little perceptible train. 787193|7|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5735|For seven or eight days we saw no material increase in its apparent diameter, and but a partial alteration in its color. 787248|8|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5736|Meantime the ordinary affairs of men were discarded, and all interests absorbed in a growing discussion, instituted by the philosophic, in respect to the cometary nature. 787368|9|17|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5737|That material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would result from the apprehended contact, was an opinion which hourly lost ground among the wise; and the wise were now freely permitted to rule the reason and the fancy of the crowd. 787538|0|18|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5738|It was demonstrated, that the density of the comet's nucleus was far less than that of our rarest gas; and the harmless passage of a similar visitor among the satellites of Jupiter was a point strongly insisted upon, and which served greatly to allay terror. 787778|1|18|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5739|Theologists, with an earnestness fear-enkindled, dwelt upon the biblical prophecies, and expounded them to the people with a directness and simplicity of which no previous instance had been known. 788036|2|18|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5740|That the final destruction of the earth must be brought about by the agency of fire, was urged with a spirit that enforced everywhere conviction; and that the comets were of no fiery nature (as all men now knew) was a truth which relieved all, in a great measure, from the apprehension of the great calamity foretold. 788232|3|18|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5741|It is noticeable that the popular prejudices and vulgar errors in regard to pestilences and wars; errors which were wont to prevail upon every appearance of a comet; were now altogether unknown. 788549|4|18|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5742|As if by some sudden convulsive exertion, reason had at once hurled superstition from her throne. 788743|5|18|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']

5744|What minor evils might arise from the contact were points of elaborate question. 788905|0|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5745|The learned spoke of slight geological disturbances, of probable alterations in climate, and consequently in vegetation; of possible magnetic and electric influences. 788985|1|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5746|A very few days sufficed, however, to merge even such feelings in sentiments more unendurable. 789151|10|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5747|We could no longer apply to the strange orb any accustomed thoughts. 789245|11|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5748|Its historical attributes had disappeared. 789313|12|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']

5750|We saw it not as an astronomical phenomenon in the heavens, but as an incubus upon our hearts, and a shadow upon our brains. 789405|14|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5751|It had taken, with inconceivable rapidity, the character of a gigantic mantle of rare flame, extending from horizon to horizon. 789529|15|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5752|Many held that no visible or perceptible effect would in any manner be produced. 789656|2|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5753|While such discussions were going on, their subject gradually approached, growing larger in apparent diameter, and of a more brilliant lustre. 789736|3|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']

5756|There was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when the comet had attained, at length, a size surpassing that of any previously recorded visitation. 789944|6|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5757|The people now, dismissing any lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong, experienced all the certainty of evil. 790103|7|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5758|The chimerical aspect of their terror was gone. 790220|8|19|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']

5771|This first sense of pain lay in a rigorous constriction of the breast and lungs, and an insufferable dryness of the skin. 791147|3|21|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5772|It could not be denied that our atmosphere was radically affected; the conformation of this atmosphere and the possible modifications to which it might be subjected, were now the topics of discussion. 791268|4|21|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']

5774|It had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound of oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of twenty-one measures of oxygen, and seventy-nine of nitrogen, in every one hundred of the atmosphere. 791579|0|22|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5775|Oxygen, which was the principle of combustion, and the vehicle of heat, was absolutely necessary to the support of animal life, and was the most powerful and energetic agent in nature. 791800|1|22|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5776|Nitrogen, on the contrary, was incapable of supporting either animal life or flame. 791984|2|22|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5777|An unnatural excess of oxygen would result, it had been ascertained, in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had latterly experienced. 792067|3|22|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']

5782|That tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us with hope, was now the source of the bitterness of despair. 792635|1|23|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5783|Then; let us bow down, Charmion, before the excessive majesty of the great God! 792753|10|23|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
5784|; then, there came a shouting and pervading sound, as if from the mouth itself of HIM; while the whole incumbent mass of ether in which we existed, burst at once into a species of intense flame, for whose surpassing brilliancy and all-fervid heat even the angels in the high Heaven of pure knowledge have no name. 792832|11|23|The Conversation Of Eiros And Charmion|1839-12-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']

5913|The item chiefly disputed in this bill was the very moderate charge of two pennies for the dickey. 808024|0|11|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5914|Upon my word of honor, this was not an unreasonable price for that dickey. 808122|1|11|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5915|It was one of the cleanest and prettiest little dickeys I ever saw; and I have good reason to believe that it effected the sale of three Petershams. 808196|2|11|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5916|The elder partner of the firm, however, would allow me only one penny of the charge, and took it upon himself to show in what manner four of the same sized conveniences could be got out of a sheet of foolscap. 808344|3|11|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5917|But it is needless to say that I stood upon the principle of the thing. 808553|4|11|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5918|Business is business, and should be done in a business way. 808624|5|11|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5919|There was no system whatever in swindling me out of a penny;a clear fraud of fifty per cent;no method in any respect. 808683|6|11|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5920|I left at once the employment of Messrs. 808800|7|11|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5921|Cut &amp; Comeagain, and set up in the Eye-Sore line by myself;one of the most lucrative, respectable, and independent of the ordinary occupations. 808840|8|11|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5922|My strict integrity, economy, and rigorous business habits, here again came into play. 808987|0|12|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5923|I found myself driving a flourishing trade, and soon became a marked man upon 'Change. 809073|1|12|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5924|I ask it of business men. 809159|10|12|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5925|It would be irrational to suppose that we can. 809184|11|12|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5926|And yet there was a rascally corporation which asked me to do this very thing;this very thing! 809230|12|12|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5927|I did not reply to their absurd proposition, of course; but I felt it a duty to go that same night, and lamp-black the whole of their palace. 809324|13|12|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5928|For this the unreasonable villains clapped me into jail; and the gentlemen of the Eye-Sore trade could not well avoid cutting my connection when I came out. 809465|14|12|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5929|The truth is, I never dabbled in flashy matters, but jogged on in the good old sober routine of the calling;a calling in which I should, no doubt, have remained to the present hour, but for a little accident which happened to me in the prosecution of one of the usual business operations of the profession. 809621|2|12|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5930|Whenever a rich old hunks or prodigal heir or bankrupt corporation gets into the notion of putting up a palace, there is no such thing in the world as stopping either of them, and this every intelligent person knows. 809927|3|12|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5931|The fact in question is indeed the basis of the Eye-Sore trade. 810143|4|12|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5932|As soon, therefore, as a building-project is fairly afoot by one of these parties, we merchants secure a nice corner of the lot in contemplation, or a prime little situation just adjoining, or tight in front. 810206|5|12|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5933|This done, we wait until the palace is half-way up, and then we pay some tasty architect to run us up an ornamental mud hovel, right against it; or a Down-East or Dutch Pagoda, or a pig-sty, or an ingenious little bit of fancy work, either Esquimau, Kickapoo, or Hottentot. 810414|6|12|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5934|Of course we can't afford to take these structures down under a bonus of five hundred per cent upon the prime cost of our lot and plaster. 810687|7|12|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5935|Can we? 810825|8|12|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5936|I ask the question. 810832|9|12|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5937|The Assault-and-Battery business, into which I was now forced to adventure for a livelihood, was somewhat ill-adapted to the delicate nature of my constitution; but I went to work in it with a good heart, and found my account here, as heretofore, in those stern habits of methodical accuracy which had been thumped into me by that delightful old nurse;I would indeed be the basest of men not to remember her well in my will. 810851|0|13|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5938|By observing, as I say, the strictest system in all my dealings, and keeping a well-regulated set of books, I was enabled to get over many serious difficulties, and, in the end, to establish myself very decently in the profession. 811275|1|13|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5939|The truth is, that few individuals, in any line, did a snugger little business than I. I will just copy a page or so out of my Day-Book; and this will save me the necessity of blowing my own trumpet;a contemptible practice of which no high-minded man will be guilty. 811505|2|13|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

5977|I AM a business man. 813528|0|2|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5978|I am a methodical man. 813548|1|2|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5979|Method is the thing, after all. 813570|2|2|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5980|But there are no people I more heartily despise than your eccentric fools who prate about method without understanding it; attending strictly to its letter, and violating its spirit. 813601|3|2|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5981|These fellows are always doing the most out-of-the-way things in what they call an orderly manner. 813783|4|2|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5982|Now here, I conceive, is a positive paradox. 813881|5|2|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5983|True method appertains to the ordinary and the obvious alone, and cannot be applied to the outre. 813925|6|2|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

5986|I found the exactions of the profession somewhat too much for my delicate state of body; and, discovering, at last, that I was knocked all out of shape, so that I didn't know very well what to make of the matter, and so that my friends, when they met me in the street, couldn't tell that I was Peter Proffit at all, it occurred to me that the best expedient I could adopt was to alter my line of business. 814240|1|20|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
5987|I turned my attention, therefore, to Mud-Dabbling, and continued it for some years. 814645|2|20|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

5989|Every ignoramus of a fellow who finds that he hasn't brains in sufficient quantity to make his way as a walking advertiser, or an eye-sore prig, or a salt-and-batter man, thinks, of course, that he'll answer very well as a dabbler of mud. 814850|1|21|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

6024|The truth is, I labored under the disadvantage of having no monkey;and American streets are so muddy, and a Democratic rabble is so obstrusive, and so full of demnition mischievous little boys. 818365|1|24|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
6025|I was now out of employment for some months, but at length succeeded, by dint of great interest, in procuring a situation in the Sham-Post. 818558|0|25|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
6026|The duties, here, are simple, and not altogether unprofitable. 818697|1|25|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
6027|I washed my hands of the matter in disgust. 818759|10|25|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
6028|For example:;very early in the morning I had to make up my packet of sham letters. 818802|2|25|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
6029|Upon the inside of each of these I had to scrawl a few lines on any subject which occurred to me as sufficiently mysterious;signing all the epistles Tom Dobson, or Bobby Tompkins, or anything in that way. 818884|3|25|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
6030|Having folded and sealed all, and stamped them with sham postmarks;New Orleans, Bengal, Botany Bay, or any other place a great way off;I set out, forthwith, upon my daily route, as if in a very great hurry. 819088|4|25|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
6031|I always called at the big houses to deliver the letters, and receive the postage. 819294|5|25|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
6032|Nobody hesitates at paying for a letter;especially for a double one;people are such fools;and it was no trouble to get round a corner before there was time to open the epistles. 819376|6|25|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
6033|The worst of this profession was, that I had to walk so much and so fast; and so frequently to vary my route. 819553|7|25|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
6034|Besides, I had serious scruples of conscience. 819662|8|25|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
6035|I can't bear to hear innocent individuals abused;and the way the whole town took to cursing Tom Dobson and Bobby Tompkins was really awful to hear. 819708|9|25|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
6036|My eighth and last speculation has been in the Cat-Growing way. 819855|0|26|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

6038|The country, it is well known, has become infested with cats;so much so of late, that a petition for relief, most numerously and respectably signed, was brought before the Legislature at its late memorable session. 820007|2|26|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
6039|The Assembly, at this epoch, was unusually well-informed, and, having passed many other wise and wholesome enactments, it crowned all with the Cat-Act. 820221|3|26|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

6044|At first I could only afford to feed them upon mice (which are cheap), but they fulfilled the scriptural injunction at so marvellous a rate, that I at length considered it my best policy to be liberal, and so indulged them in oysters and turtle. 820746|1|27|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

6049|A good-hearted old Irish nurse (whom I shall not forget in my will) took me up one day by the heels, when I was making more noise than was necessary, and swinging me round two or knocked my head into a cocked hat against the bedpost. 821538|1|3|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

6052|Hence that positive appetite for system and regularity which has made me the distinguished man of business that I am. 821942|4|3|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

6063|Moreover, my occupations have been always made to chime in with the ordinary habitudes of my fellowmen. 823626|3|5|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
6064|Not that I feel the least indebted, upon this score, to my exceedingly weak-minded parents, who, beyond doubt, would have made an arrant genius of me at last, if my guardian angel had not come, in good time, to the rescue. 823729|4|5|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
6065|"In biography the truth is every thing, and in autobiography it is especially so- yet I scarcely hope to be believed when I state, however solemnly, that my poor father put me, when I was about fifteen years of age, into the counting-house of what be termed ""a respectable hardware and commission merchant doing a capital bit of business""! 823951"|5|5|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

6067|However, the consequence of this folly was, that in two or three days, I had to be sent home to my button-headed family in a high state of fever, and with a most violent and dangerous pain in the sinciput, all around about my organ of order. 824318|7|5|The Business Man|1840-02-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

6096|Descending in the scale of what is termed gentility, I found darker and deeper themes for speculation. 827355|0|10|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6097|I saw Jew pedlars, with hawk eyes flashing from countenances whose every other feature wore only an expression of abject humility; sturdy professional street beggars scowling upon mendicants of a better stamp, whom despair alone had driven forth into the night for charity; feeble and ghastly invalids, upon whom death had placed a sure hand, and who sidled and tottered through the mob, looking every one beseechingly in the face, as if in search of some chance consolation, some lost hope; modest young girls returning from long and late labor to a cheerless home, and shrinking more tearfully than indignantly from the glances of ruffians, whose direct contact, even, could not be avoided; women of the town of all kinds and of all ages–the unequivocal beauty in the prime of her womanhood, putting one in mind of the statue in Lucian, with the surface of Parian marble, and the interior filled with filth–the loathsome and utterly lost leper in rags–the wrinkled, bejewelled, and paint-begrimed beldame, making a last effort at youth–the mere child of immature form, yet, from long association, an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her trade, and burning with a rabid ambition to be ranked the equal of her elders in vice; drunkards innumerable and indescribable–some in shreds and patches, reeling, inarticulate, with bruised visage and lack-lustre eyes–some in whole although filthy garments, with a slightly unsteady swagger, thick sensual lips, and hearty-looking rubicund faces–others clothed in materials which had once been good, and which even now were scrupulously well brushed-men who walked with a more than naturally firm and springy step, but whose countenances were fearfully pale, and whose eyes were hideously wild and red; and who clutched with quivering fingers, as they strode through the crowd, at every object which came within their reach; beside these, pic-men, porters, coal-heavers, sweeps; organ-grinders, monkey-exhibitors, and ballad-mongers, those who vended with those who sang; ragged artizans and exhausted laborers of every description, and all full of a noisy and inordinate vivacity which jarred discordantly upon the ear, and gave an aching sensation to the eye. 827457|1|10|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6098|As the night deepened, so deepened to me the interest of the scene; for not only did the general character of the crowd materially alter (its gentler features retiring in the gradual withdrawal of the more orderly portion of the people, and its harsher ones coming out into bolder relief, as the late hour brought forth every species of infamy from its den), but the rays of the gas-lamps, feeble at first in their struggle with the dying day, had now at length gained ascendancy, and threw over every thing a fitful and garish lustre. 829661|0|11|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

6100|The wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination of individual faces; and although the rapidity with which the world of light flitted before the window prevented me from casting more than a glance upon each visage, still it seemed that, in my then peculiar mental state, I could frequently read, even in that brief interval of a glance, the history of long years. 830286|0|12|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6101|With my brow to the glass, I was thus occupied in scrutinizing the mob, when suddenly there came into view a countenance (that of a decrepid old man, some sixty-five or seventy years of age)–a countenance which at once arrested and absorbed my whole attention, on account of the absolute idiosyncrasy of its expression. 830661|0|13|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

6104|As I endeavored, during the brief minute of my original survey, to form some analysis of the meaning conveyed, there arose confusedly and paradoxically within my mind, the ideas of vast mental power, of caution, of penuriousness, of avarice, of coolness, of malice, of blood-thirstiness, of triumph, of merriment, of excessive terror, of intense–of supreme despair. 831227|3|13|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

6108|Hurriedly putting on all overcoat, and seizing my hat and cane, I made my way into the street, and pushed through the crowd in the direction which I had seen him take; for he had already disappeared. 831782|7|13|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6109|With some little difficulty I at length came within sight of him, approached, and followed him closely, yet cautiously, so as not to attract his attention. 831981|8|13|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

6111|He was short in stature, very thin, and apparently very feeble. 832189|1|14|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6112|His clothes, generally, were filthy and ragged; but as he came, now and then, within the strong glare of a lamp, I perceived that his linen, although dirty, was of beautiful texture; and my vision deceived me, or, through a rent in a closely buttoned and evidently second-handed roquelaire which enveloped him, I caught a glimpse both of a diamond and of a dagger. 832252|2|14|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6113|These observations heightened my curiosity, and I resolved to follow the stranger whithersoever he should go. 832616|3|14|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6114|It was now fully night-fall, and a thick humid fog hung over the city, soon ending in a settled and heavy rain. 832725|0|15|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

6116|He crossed and re-crossed the way repeatedly, without apparent aim; and the press was still so thick, that, at every such movement, I was obliged to follow him closely. 832989|10|15|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6117|The street was a narrow and long one, and his course lay within it for nearly an hour, during which the passengers had gradually diminished to about that number which is ordinarily seen at noon in Broadway near the park–so vast a difference is there between a London populace and that of the most frequented American city. 833157|11|15|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

6120|His chin fell upon his breast, while his eyes rolled wildly from under his knit brows, in every direction, upon those who hemmed him in. 833608|14|15|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6121|He urged his way steadily and perseveringly. 833744|15|15|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6122|I was surprised, however, to find, upon his having made the circuit of the square, that he turned and retraced his steps. 833788|16|15|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6123|Still more was I astonished to see him repeat the same walk several times–once nearly detecting me as he came around with a sudden movement. 833909|17|15|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6124|The waver, the jostle, and the hum increased in a tenfold degree. 834049|2|15|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6125|For my own part I did not much regard the rain–the lurking of an old fever in my system rendering the moisture somewhat too dangerously pleasant. 834114|3|15|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6126|Tying a handkerchief about my mouth, I kept on. 834259|4|15|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6127|For half an hour the old man held his way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare; and I here walked close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him. 834306|5|15|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6128|Never once turning his head to look back, he did not observe me. 834467|6|15|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6129|By and by he passed into a cross street, which, although densely filled with people, was not quite so much thronged as the main one he had quitted. 834531|7|15|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6130|Here a change in his demeanor became evident. 834678|8|15|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6131|He walked more slowly and with less object than before- more hesitatingly. 834723|9|15|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6132|In this exercise he spent another hour, at the end of which we met with far less interruption from passengers than at first. 834797|0|16|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6133|The rain fell fast, the air grew cool; and the people were retiring to their homes. 834921|1|16|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6134|With a gesture of impatience, the wanderer passed into a by-street comparatively deserted. 835004|2|16|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6135|Down this, some quarter of a mile long, he rushed with an activity I could not have dreamed of seeing in one so aged, and which put me to much trouble in pursuit. 835094|3|16|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6136|A few minutes brought us to a large and busy bazaar, with the localities of which the stranger appeared well acquainted, and where his original demeanor again became apparent, as he forced his way to and fro, without aim, among the host of buyers and sellers. 835256|4|16|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6137|During the hour and a half, or thereabouts, which we passed in this place, it required much caution on my part to keep him within reach without attracting his observation. 835515|0|17|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6138|Luckily I wore a pair of caoutchouc overshoes, and could move about in perfect silence. 835686|1|17|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6139|At no moment did he see that I watched him. 835773|2|17|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6140|He entered shop after shop, priced nothing, spoke no word, and looked at all objects with a wild and vacant stare. 835816|3|17|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6141|I was now utterly amazed at his behavior, and firmly resolved that we should not part until I had satisfied myself in some measure respecting him. 835930|4|17|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6142|A loud-toned clock struck eleven, and the company were fast deserting the bazaar. 836076|0|18|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6143|A shop-keeper, in putting up a shutter, jostled the old man, and at the instant I saw a strong shudder come over his frame. 836157|1|18|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6144|I observed that he now took the course in which had gone the greater number of the audience but, upon the whole, I was at a loss to comprehend the waywardness of his actions. 836280|10|18|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6145|He hurried into the street, looked anxiously around him for an instant, and then ran with incredible swiftness through many crooked and peopleless lanes, until we emerged once more upon the great thoroughfare whence we had started–the street of the D---Hotel. 836454|2|18|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6146|It no longer wore, however, the same aspect. 836713|3|18|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6147|It was still brilliant with gas; but the rain fell fiercely, and there were few persons to be seen. 836757|4|18|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6148|The stranger grew pale. 836856|5|18|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6149|He walked moodily some paces up the once populous avenue, then, with a heavy sigh, turned in the direction of the river, and, plunging through a great variety of devious ways, came out, at length, in view of one of the principal theatres. 836879|6|18|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6150|It was about being closed, and the audience were thronging from the doors. 837117|7|18|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6151|I saw the old man gasp as if for breath while he threw himself amid the crowd; but I thought that the intense agony of his countenance had, in some measure, abated. 837191|8|18|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6152|His head again fell upon his breast; he appeared as I had seen him at first. 837355|9|18|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6153|As he proceeded, the company grew more scattered, and his old uneasiness and vacillation were resumed. 837431|0|19|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6154|For some time he followed closely a party of some ten or twelve roisterers; but from this number one by one dropped off, until three only remained together, in a narrow and gloomy lane, little frequented. 837533|1|19|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6155|Once more he strode onward with elastic tread. 837737|10|19|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6156|Suddenly a corner was turned, a blaze of light burst upon our sight, and we stood before one of the huge suburban temples of Intemperance–one of the palaces of the fiend, Gin. 837783|11|19|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6157|The stranger paused, and, for a moment, seemed lost in thought; then, with every mark of agitation, pursued rapidly a route which brought us to the verge of the city, amid regions very different from those we had hitherto traversed. 837958|2|19|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6158|It was the most noisome quarter of London, where every thing wore the worst impress of the most deplorable poverty, and of the most desperate crime. 838190|3|19|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6159|By the dim light of an accidental lamp, tall, antique, worm-eaten, wooden tenements were seen tottering to their fall, in directions so many and capricious, that scarce the semblance of a passage was discernible between them. 838338|4|19|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6160|The paving-stones lay at random, displaced from their beds by the rankly-growing grass. 838563|5|19|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6161|Horrible filth festered in the dammed-up gutters. 838650|6|19|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6162|The whole atmosphere teemed with desolation. 838699|7|19|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6163|Yet, as we proceeded, the sounds of human life revived by sure degrees, and at length large bands of the most abandoned of a London populace were seen reeling to and fro. 838743|8|19|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6164|The spirits of the old man again flickered up, as a lamp which is near its death-hour. 838913|9|19|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6165|Not long ago, about the closing in of an evening in autumn, I sat at the large bow–window of the D-–Coffee-House in London. 838999|0|2|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6166|For some months I had been ill in health, but was now convalescent, and, with returning strength, found myself in one of those happy moods which are so precisely the converse of ennui-moods of the keenest appetency, when the film from the mental vision departs–achlus os prin epeen- and the intellect, electrified, surpasses as greatly its everyday condition, as does the vivid yet candid reason of Leibnitz, the mad and flimsy rhetoric of Gorgias. 839122|1|2|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6167|Merely to breathe was enjoyment; and I derived positive pleasure even from many of the legitimate sources of pain. 839570|2|2|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6168|I felt a calm but inquisitive interest in every thing. 839684|3|2|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6169|With a cigar in my mouth and a newspaper in my lap, I had been amusing myself for the greater part of the afternoon, now in poring over advertisements, now in observing the promiscuous company in the room, and now in peering through the smoky panes into the street. 839738|4|2|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6170|It was now nearly daybreak; but a number of wretched inebriates still pressed in and out of the flaunting entrance. 840003|0|20|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6171|With a half shriek of joy the old man forced a passage within, resumed at once his original bearing, and stalked backward and forward, without apparent object, among the throng. 840118|1|20|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6172|He noticed me not, but resumed his solemn walk, while I, ceasing to follow, remained absorbed in contemplation. 840295|10|20|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6173|"""The old man,"" I said at length, ""is the type and the genius of deep crime. 840406"|11|20|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6174|He refuses to be alone. 840481|12|20|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6175|He is the man of the crowd. 840504|13|20|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6176|It will be in vain to follow, for I shall learn no more of him, nor of his deeds. 840531|14|20|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6177|"The worst heart of the world is a grosser book than the 'Hortulus Animae,'* and perhaps it is but one of the great mercies of God that ""er lasst sich nicht lesen"". 840612"|15|20|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6178|He had not been thus long occupied, however, before a rush to the doors gave token that the host was closing them for the night. 840775|2|20|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6179|It was something even more intense than despair that I then observed upon the countenance of the singular being whom I had watched so pertinaciously. 840903|3|20|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6180|Yet he did not hesitate in his career, but, with a mad energy, retraced his steps at once, to the heart of the mighty London. 841052|4|20|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6181|Long and swiftly he fled, while I followed him in the wildest amazement, resolute not to abandon a scrutiny in which I now felt an interest all-absorbing. 841177|5|20|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6182|The sun arose while we proceeded, and, when we had once again reached that most thronged mart of the populous town, the street of the D-–Hotel, it presented an appearance of human bustle and activity scarcely inferior to what I had seen on the evening before. 841331|6|20|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6183|And here, long, amid the momently increasing confusion, did I persist in my pursuit of the stranger. 841590|7|20|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6184|But, as usual, he walked to and fro, and during the day did not pass from out the turmoil of that street. 841690|8|20|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6185|And, as the shades of the second evening came on, I grew wearied unto death, and, stopping fully in front of the wanderer, gazed at him steadfastly in the face. 841795|9|20|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6186|"* The ""Hortulus Animae cum Oratiunculis Aliquibus Superadditis"" of Grunninger. 841955"|0|21|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6187|This latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city, and had been very much crowded during the whole day. 842033|0|3|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6188|But, as the darkness came on, the throng momently increased; and, by the time the lamps were well lighted, two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past the door. 842148|1|3|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6189|At this particular period of the evening I had never before been in a similar situation, and the tumultuous sea of human heads filled me, therefore, with a delicious novelty of emotion. 842327|2|3|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6190|I gave up, at length, all care of things within the hotel, and became absorbed in contemplation of the scene without. 842512|3|3|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6191|At first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn. 842629|0|4|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6192|I looked at the passengers in masses, and thought of them in their aggregate relations. 842693|1|4|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6193|Soon, however, I descended to details, and regarded with minute interest the innumerable varieties of figure, dress, air, gait, visage, and expression of countenance. 842780|2|4|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6194|By far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied, business-like demeanor, and seemed to be thinking only of making their way through the press. 842946|0|5|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6195|Their brows were knit, and their eyes rolled quickly; when pushed against by fellow-wayfarers they evinced no symptom of impatience, but adjusted their clothes and hurried on. 843103|1|5|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6196|Others, still a numerous class, were restless in their movements, had flushed faces, and talked and gesticulated to themselves, as if feeling in solitude on account of the very denseness of the company around. 843278|2|5|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6197|When impeded in their progress, these people suddenly ceased muttering; but redoubled their gesticulations, and awaited, with an absent and overdone smile upon their lips, the course of the persons impeding them. 843487|3|5|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6198|If jostled, they bowed profusely to the jostlers, and appeared overwhelmed with confusion. 843699|4|5|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6199|There was nothing very distinctive about these two large classes beyond what I have noted. 843789|5|5|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6200|Their habiliments belonged to that order which is pointedly termed the decent. 843879|6|5|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6201|They were undoubtedly noblemen, merchants, attorneys, tradesmen, stock-jobbers–the Eupatrids and the common-places of society–men of leisure and men actively engaged in affairs of their own–conducting business upon their own responsibility. 843957|7|5|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6202|They did not greatly excite my attention. 844197|8|5|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6203|The tribe of clerks was an obvious one; and here I discerned two remarkable divisions. 844238|0|6|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6204|There were the junior clerks of flash houses- young gentlemen with tight coats, bright boots, well-oiled hair, and supercilious lips. 844324|1|6|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6205|Setting aside a certain dapperness of carriage, which may be termed deskism for want of a better word, the manner of these persons seemed to be an exact facsimile of what had been the perfection of bon ton about twelve or eighteen months before. 844457|2|6|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6206|They wore the castoff graces of the gentry;–and this, I believe, involves the best definition of the class. 844702|3|6|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6207|"The division of the upper clerks of staunch firms, or of the ""steady old fellows,"" it was not possible to mistake. 844809"|0|7|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6208|These were known by their coats and pantaloons of black or brown, made to sit comfortably, with white cravats and waistcoats, broad solid-looking shoes, and thick hose or gaiters. 844923|1|7|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6209|They had all slightly bald heads, from which the right ears, long used to pen-holding, had an odd habit of standing off on end. 845102|2|7|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6210|I observed that they always removed or settled their hats with both bands, and wore watches, with short gold chains of a substantial and ancient pattern. 845229|3|7|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6211|Theirs was the affectation of respectability–if indeed there be an affectation so honorable. 845382|4|7|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6212|There were many individuals of dashing appearance, whom I easily understood as belonging to the race of swell pick-pockets, with which all great cities are infested. 845474|0|8|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6213|I watched these gentry with much inquisitiveness, and found it difficult to imagine how they should ever be mistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen themselves. 845639|1|8|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6214|Their voluminousness of wristband, with an air of excessive frankness, should betray them at once. 845794|2|8|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6215|The gamblers, of whom I descried not a few, were still more easily recognizable. 845892|0|9|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6216|They wore every variety of dress, from that of the desperate thimble-rig bully, with velvet waistcoat, fancy neckerchief, gilt chains, and filagreed buttons, to that of the scrupulously inornate clergyman, than which nothing could be less liable to suspicion. 845972|1|9|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6217|Still all were distinguished by a certain sodden swarthiness of complexion, a filmy dimness of eye, and pallor and compression of lip. 846231|2|9|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6218|There were two other traits, moreover, by which I could always detect them: a guarded lowness of tone in conversation, and a more than ordinary extension of the thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers. 846365|3|9|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6219|Very often, in company with these sharpers, I observed an order of men somewhat different in habits, but still birds of a kindred feather. 846580|4|9|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
6220|They may be defined as the gentlemen who live by their wits. 846718|5|9|The Man Of The Crowd|1840-12-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

6225|THE mental features discoursed of as the analytical, are, in themselves, but little susceptible of analysis. 847166|0|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6226|The ways of God in Nature, as in Providence, are not as our ways; nor are the models that we frame any way commensurate to the vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works, which have a depth in them greater than the well of Democritus. 847274|0|1|A Descent Into The Maelström|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

6228|It follows that the game of chess, in its effects upon mental character, is greatly misunderstood. 847562|10|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6229|I am not now writing a treatise, but simply prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations very much at random; I will, therefore, take occasion to assert that the higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully tasked by the unostentatious game of draughts than by all the elaborate frivolity of chess. 847660|11|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6230|In this latter, where the pieces have different and bizarre motions, with various and variable values, what is only complex is mistaken (a not unusual error) for what is profound. 848003|12|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6231|The attention is here called powerfully into play. 848182|13|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6232|If it flag for an instant, an oversight is committed, resulting in injury or defeat. 848232|14|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6233|The possible moves being not only manifold but involute, the chances of such oversights are multiplied; and in nine cases out of ten it is the more concentrative rather than the more acute player who conquers. 848316|15|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6234|In draughts, on the contrary, where the moves are unique and have but little variation, the probabilities of inadvertence are diminished, and the mere attention being left comparatively what advantages are obtained by either party are obtained by superior acumen. 848525|16|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6235|To be less abstract --Let us suppose a game of draughts where the pieces are reduced to four kings, and where, of course, no oversight is to be expected. 848788|17|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6236|It is obvious that here the victory can be decided (the players being at all equal) only by some recherche movement, the result of some strong exertion of the intellect. 848941|18|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6237|Deprived of ordinary resources, the analyst throws himself into the spirit of his opponent, identifies himself therewith, and not unfrequently sees thus, at a glance, the sole methods (sometimes indeed absurdly simple ones) by which he may seduce into error or hurry into miscalculation. 849110|19|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

6239|As the strong man exults in his physical ability, delighting in such exercises as call his muscles into action, so glories the analyst in that moral activity which disentangles. 849540|3|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6240|He derives pleasure from even the most trivial occupations bringing his talents into play. 849717|4|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6241|He is fond of enigmas, of conundrums, of hieroglyphics; exhibiting in his solutions of each a degree of acumen which appears to the ordinary apprehension preternatural. 849807|5|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6242|His results, brought about by the very soul and essence of method, have, in truth, the whole air of intuition. 849975|6|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6243|The faculty of re-solution is possibly much invigorated by mathematical study, and especially by that highest branch of it which, unjustly, and merely on account of its retrograde operations, has been called, as if par excellence, analysis. 850085|7|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6244|Yet to calculate is not in itself to analyze. 850325|8|1|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

6248|What I have described in the Frenchman, was merely the result of an excited, or perhaps of a diseased intelligence. 850751|1|10|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6249|As the old man spoke, I became aware of a loud and gradually increasing sound, like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an American prairie; and at the same moment I perceived that what seamen term the chopping character of the ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing into a current which set to the eastward. 850866|1|10|A Descent Into The Maelström|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
6250|But of the character of his remarks at the periods in question an example will best convey the idea. 851183|2|10|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6251|Even while I gazed, this current acquired a monstrous velocity. 851283|2|10|A Descent Into The Maelström|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

6254|Here the vast bed of the waters, seamed and scarred into a thousand conflicting channels, burst suddenly into phrensied convulsion --heaving, boiling, hissing --gyrating in gigantic and innumerable vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to the eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes except in precipitous descents. 851566|5|10|A Descent Into The Maelström|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

6262|Should they even trace the animal, it would be impossible to prove me cognizant of the murder, or to implicate me in guilt on account of that cognizance. 852417|15|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6263|Above all, I am known. 852570|16|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

6267|Here, however, is a small piece of ribbon, which from its form, and from its greasy appearance, has evidently been used in tying the hair in one of those long queues of which sailors are so fond. 852848|2|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

6270|Moreover, this knot is one which few besides sailors can tie, and is peculiar to the Maltese. 853224|3|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

6273|Now if, after all, I am wrong in my induction from this ribbon, that the Frenchman was a sailor belonging to a Maltese vessel, still I can have done no harm in saying what I did in the advertisement. 853426|6|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6274|If I am in error, he will merely suppose that I have been misled by some circumstance into which he will not take the trouble to inquire. 853625|7|100|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

6334|From what I have already said, you must know that I have had means of information about this matter --means of which you could never have dreamed. 858525|5|116|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

6347|After great trouble, occasioned by the intractable ferocity of his captive during the home voyage, he at length succeeded in lodging it safely at his own residence in Paris, where, not to attract toward himself the unpleasant curiosity of his neighbors, he kept it carefully secluded, until such time as it should recover from a wound in the foot, received from a splinter on board ship. 859634|5|119|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

6352|Returning home from some sailors' frolic on the night, or rather in the morning of the murder, he found the beast occupying his own bed-room, into which it had broken from a closet adjoining, where it had been, as was thought, securely confined. 860302|0|120|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

6354|Terrified at the sight of so dangerous a weapon in the possession of an animal so ferocious, and so well able to use it, the man, for some moments, was at a loss what to do. 860748|2|120|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6355|He had been accustomed, however, to quiet the creature, even in its fiercest moods, by the use of a whip, and to this he now resorted. 860921|3|120|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6356|Upon sight of it, the Ourang-Outang sprang at once through the door of the chamber, down the stairs, and thence, through a window, unfortunately open, into the street. 861055|4|120|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6357|The Frenchman followed in despair; the ape, razor still in hand, occasionally stopping to look back and gesticulate at its pursuer, until the latter had nearly come up with it. 861222|0|121|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6358|It then again made off. 861398|1|121|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6359|In this manner the chase continued for a long time. 861421|2|121|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6360|The streets were profoundly quiet, as it was nearly three o'clock in the morning. 861472|3|121|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6361|In passing down an alley in the rear of the Rue Morgue, the fugitive's attention was arrested by a light gleaming from the open window of Madame L'Espanaye's chamber, in the fourth story of her house. 861553|4|121|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6362|Rushing to the building, it perceived the lightning-rod, clambered up with inconceivable agility, grasped the shutter, which was thrown fully back against the wall, and, by its means, swung itself directly upon the headboard of the bed. 861753|5|121|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6363|The whole feat did not occupy a minute. 861989|6|121|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6364|The shutter was kicked open again by the Ourang-Outang as it entered the room. 862028|7|121|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6365|The sailor, in the meantime, was both rejoiced and perplexed. 862106|0|122|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6366|He had strong hopes of now recapturing the brute, as it could scarcely escape from the trap into which it had ventured, except by the rod, where it might be intercepted as it came down. 862167|1|122|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6367|The flapping-to of the shutter would naturally have been attributed to the wind. 862352|10|122|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6368|On the other hand, there was much cause for anxiety as to what it might do in the house. 862432|2|122|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6369|This latter reflection urged the man still to follow the fugitive. 862520|3|122|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6370|A lightning-rod is ascended without difficulty, especially by a sailor; but, when he had arrived as high as the window, which lay far to his left, his career was stopped; the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so as to obtain a glimpse of the interior of the room. 862586|4|122|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6371|At this glimpse he nearly fell from his hold through excess of horror. 862863|5|122|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6372|Now it was that those hideous shrieks arose upon the night, which had startled from slumber the inmates of the Rue Morgue. 862933|6|122|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6373|Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter, habited in their night clothes, had apparently been arranging some papers in the iron chest already mentioned, which had been wheeled into the middle of the room. 863055|7|122|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6374|It was open, and its contents lay beside it on the floor. 863253|8|122|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6375|The victims must have been sitting with their backs toward the window; and, from the time elapsing between the ingress of the beast and the screams, it seems probable that it was not immediately perceived. 863310|9|122|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6376|As the sailor looked in, the gigantic animal had seized Madame L'Espanaye by the hair, (which was loose, as she had been combing it,) and was flourishing the razor about her face, in imitation of the motions of a barber. 863515|0|123|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

6378|The screams and struggles of the old lady (during which the hair was torn from her head) had the effect of changing the probably pacific purposes of the Ourang-Outang into those of wrath. 863794|2|123|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6379|With one determined sweep of its muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her body. 863981|3|123|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6380|The sight of blood inflamed its anger into phrenzy. 864068|4|123|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6381|Gnashing its teeth, and flashing fire from its eves, it flew upon the body of the girl, and imbedded its fearful talons in her throat, retaining its grasp until she expired. 864119|5|123|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6382|Its wandering and wild glances fell at this moment upon the head of the bed, over which the face of its master, rigid with horror, was just discernible. 864292|6|123|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6383|The fury of the beast, who no doubt bore still in mind the dreaded whip, was instantly converted into fear. 864444|7|123|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6384|Conscious of having deserved punishment, it seemed desirous of concealing its bloody deeds, and skipped about the chamber in an agony of nervous agitation; throwing down and breaking the furniture as it moved, and dragging the bed from the bedstead. 864551|8|123|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6385|In conclusion, it seized first the corpse of the daughter, and thrust it up the chimney, as it was found; then that of the old lady, which it immediately hurled through the window headlong. 864800|9|123|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6386|As the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden, the sailor shrank aghast to the rod, and, rather gliding than clambering down it, hurried at once home --dreading the consequences of the butchery, and gladly abandoning, in his terror, all solicitude about the fate of the Ourang-Outang. 864989|0|124|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6387|The words heard by the party upon the staircase were the Frenchman's exclamations of horror and affright, commingled with the fiendish jabberings of the brute. 865288|1|124|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

6393|This functionary, however well disposed to my friend, could not altogether conceal his chagrin at the turn which affairs had taken, and was fain to indulge in a sarcasm or two, about the propriety of every person minding his own business. 865891|5|125|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

6925|They have fAllan into the gross but common error of confounding the unusual with the abstruse. 932920|6|62|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6926|But it is by these deviations from the plane of the ordinary, that reason feels its way, if at all, in its search for the true. 933014|7|62|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6927|In investigations such as we are now pursuing, it should not be so much asked 'what has occurred,' as 'what has occurred that has never occurred before. 933141|8|62|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6928|"' In fact, the facility with which I shall arrive, or have arrived, at the solution of this mystery, is in the direct ratio of its apparent insolubility in the eyes of the police"". 933293"|9|62|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6929|I stared at the speaker in mute astonishment. 933473|0|63|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6930|"""I am now awaiting,"" continued he, looking toward the door of our apartment --""I am now awaiting a person who, although perhaps not the perpetrator of these butcheries, must have been in some measure implicated in their perpetration. 933518"|0|64|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6931|Of the worst portion of the crimes committed, it is probable that he is innocent. 933751|1|64|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6932|I hope that I am right in this supposition; for upon it I build my expectation of reading the entire riddle. 933832|2|64|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6933|I look for the man here --in this room --every moment. 933940|3|64|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6934|It is true that he may not arrive; but the probability is that he will. 933994|4|64|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6935|Should he come, it will be necessary to detain him. 934065|5|64|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6936|"Here are pistols; and we both know how to use them when occasion demands their use"". 934116"|6|64|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6937|I took the pistols, scarcely knowing what I did, or believing what I heard, while Dupin went on, very much as if in a soliloquy. 934200|0|65|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6938|I have already spoken of his abstract manner at such times. 934328|1|65|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6939|His discourse was addressed to myself; but his voice, although by no means loud, had that intonation which is commonly employed in speaking to some one at a great distance. 934387|2|65|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6940|His eyes, vacant in expression, regarded only the wall. 934559|3|65|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6941|"""That the voices heard in contention,"" he said, ""by the party upon the stairs, were not the voices of the women themselves, was fully proved by the evidence. 934614"|0|66|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6942|This relieves us of all doubt upon the question whether the old lady could have first destroyed the daughter, and afterward have committed suicide. 934771|1|66|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6943|I speak of this point chiefly for the sake of method; for the strength of Madame L'Espanaye would have been utterly unequal to the task of thrusting her daughter's corpse up the chimney as it was found; and the nature of the wounds upon her own person entirely preclude the idea of self-destruction. 934918|2|66|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6944|Murder, then, has been committed by some third party; and the voices of this third party were those heard in contention. 935217|3|66|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6945|Let me now advert --not to the whole testimony respecting these voices --but to what was peculiar in that testimony. 935337|4|66|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6946|"Did you observe anything peculiar about it""? 935453"|5|66|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6947|I remarked that, while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the gruff voice to be that of a Frenchman, there was much disagreement in regard to the shrill, or, as one individual termed it, the harsh voice. 935497|0|67|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6948|"""That was the evidence itself,"" said Dupin, ""but it was not the peculiarity of the evidence. 935703"|0|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6949|You have observed nothing distinctive. 935795|1|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6950|' The Spaniard 'is sure' that it was that of an Englishman, but 'judges by the intonation' altogether, 'as he has no knowledge of the English. 935833|10|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6951|' The Italian believes it the voice of a Russian, but 'has never conversed with a native of Russia. 935975|11|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6952|' A second Frenchman differs, moreover, with the first, and is positive that the voice was that of an Italian; but, not being cognizant of that tongue, is, like the Spaniard, 'convinced by the intonation. 936074|12|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6953|' Now, how strangely unusual must that voice have really been, about which such testimony as this could have been elicited! 936278|13|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6954|--in whose tones, even, denizens of the five great divisions of Europe could recognise nothing familiar! 936401|14|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6955|You will say that it might have been the voice of an Asiatic --of an African. 936505|15|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6956|Neither Asiatics nor Africans abound in Paris; but, without denying the inference, I will now merely call your attention to three points. 936582|16|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6957|The voice is termed by one witness 'harsh rather than shrill. 936719|17|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6958|' It is represented by two others to have been 'quick and unequal' No words --no sounds resembling words --were by any witness mentioned as distinguishable. 936780|18|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6959|Yet there was something to be observed. 936936|2|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6960|The witnesses, as you remark, agreed about the gruff voice; they were here unanimous. 936975|3|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6961|But in regard to the shrill voice, the peculiarity is not that they disagreed --but that, while an Italian, an Englishman, a Spaniard, a Hollander, and a Frenchman attempted to describe it, each one spoke of it as that of a foreigner. 937060|4|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6962|Each is sure that it was not the voice of one of his own countrymen. 937294|5|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6963|Each likens it --not to the voice of an individual of any nation with whose language he is conversant --but the converse. 937362|6|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6964|The Frenchman supposes it the voice of a Spaniard, and 'might have distinguished some words had he been acquainted with the Spanish. 937483|7|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6965|' The Dutchman maintains it to have been that of a Frenchman; but we find it stated that 'not understanding French this witness was examined through an interpreter. 937615|8|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6966|' The Englishman thinks it the voice of a German, and 'does not understand German. 937779|9|68|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6967|"""I know not,"" continued Dupin, ""what impression I may have made, so far, upon your own understanding; but I do not hesitate to say that legitimate deductions even from this portion of the testimony --the portion respecting the gruff and shrill voices --are in themselves sufficient to engender a suspicion which should give direction to all farther progress in the investigation of the mystery. 937861"|0|69|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6968|I said 'legitimate deductions;' but my meaning is not thus fully expressed. 938255|1|69|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6969|I designed to imply that the deductions are the sole proper ones, and that the suspicion arises inevitably from them as the single result. 938330|2|69|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6970|What the suspicion is, however, I will not say just yet. 938468|3|69|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6971|I merely wish you to bear in mind that, with myself, it was sufficiently forcible to give a definite form --a certain tendency --to my inquiries in the chamber. 938524|4|69|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6972|Had the routine of our life at this place been known to the world, we should have been regarded as madmen --although, perhaps, as madmen of a harmless nature. 938684|0|7|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6973|I looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whose waters wore so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the Nubian geographer's account of the Mare Tenebrarum. 938842|0|7|A Descent Into The Maelström|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
6974|Our seclusion was perfect. 939014|1|7|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6975|A panorama more deplorably desolate no human imagination can conceive. 939040|1|7|A Descent Into The Maelström|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
6976|We admitted no visitors. 939110|2|7|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6977|To the right and left, as far as the eye could reach, there lay outstretched, like ramparts of the world, lines of horridly black and beetling cliff, whose character of gloom was but the more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against it its white and ghastly crest, howling and shrieking for ever. 939134|2|7|A Descent Into The Maelström|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
6978|Indeed the locality of our retirement had been carefully kept a secret from my own former associates; and it had been many years since Dupin had ceased to know or be known in Paris. 939451|3|7|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6979|Just opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed, and at a distance of some five or six miles out at sea, there was visible a small, bleak-looking island; or, more properly, its position was discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was enveloped. 939632|3|7|A Descent Into The Maelström|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
6980|We existed within ourselves alone. 939904|4|7|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6981|About two miles nearer the land, arose another of smaller size, hideously craggy and barren, and encompassed at various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks. 939938|4|7|A Descent Into The Maelström|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
6982|"""Let us now transport ourselves, in fancy, to this chamber. 940095"|0|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6983|What shall we first seek here? 940154|1|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6984|It is then only from these two apartments that we have to seek issues. 940184|10|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6985|The police have laid bare the floors, the ceilings, and the masonry of the walls, in every direction. 940254|11|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6986|No secret issues could have escaped their vigilance. 940355|12|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6987|But, not trusting to their eyes, I examined with my own. 940407|13|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6988|There were, then, no secret issues. 940463|14|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6989|Both doors leading from the rooms into the passage were securely locked, with the keys inside. 940498|15|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6990|Let us turn to the chimneys. 940592|16|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6991|These, although of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet above the hearths, will not admit, throughout their extent, the body of a large cat. 940620|17|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6992|The impossibility of egress, by means already stated, being thus absolute, we are reduced to the windows. 940765|18|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6993|Through those of the front room no one could have escaped without notice from the crowd in the street. 940870|19|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6994|The means of egress employed by the murderers. 940972|2|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6995|The murderers must have passed, then, through those of the back room. 941018|20|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6996|Now, brought to this conclusion in so unequivocal a manner as we are, it is not our part, as reasoners, to reject it on account of apparent impossibilities. 941087|21|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6997|It is only left for us to prove that these apparent 'impossibilities' are, in reality, not such. 941243|22|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6998|It is not too much to say that neither of us believe in praeternatural events. 941339|3|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
6999|Madame and Mademoiselle L'Espanaye were not destroyed by spirits. 941417|4|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7000|The doers of the deed were material, and escaped materially. 941482|5|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7001|Then how? 941542|6|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7002|Fortunately, there is but one mode of reasoning upon the point, and that mode must lead us to a definite decision. 941551|7|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7003|--Let us examine, each by each, the possible means of egress. 941665|8|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7004|It is clear that the assassins were in the room where Mademoiselle L'Espanaye was found, or at least in the room adjoining, when the party ascended the stairs. 941726|9|70|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7005|"""There are two windows in the chamber. 941885"|0|71|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7006|One of them is unobstructed by furniture, and is wholly visible. 941923|1|71|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7007|The lower portion of the other is hidden from view by the head of the unwieldy bedstead which is thrust close up against it. 941987|2|71|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7008|The former was found securely fastened from within. 942111|3|71|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7009|It resisted the utmost force of those who endeavored to raise it. 942162|4|71|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7010|A large gimlet-hole had been pierced in its frame to the left, and a very stout nail was found fitted therein, nearly to the head. 942227|5|71|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7011|Upon examining the other window, a similar nail was seen similarly fitted in it; and a vigorous attempt to raise this sash, failed also. 942357|6|71|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7012|The police were now entirely satisfied that egress had not been in these directions. 942493|7|71|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7013|And, therefore, it was thought a matter of supererogation to withdraw the nails and open the windows. 942577|8|71|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7014|"""My own examination was somewhat more particular, and was so for the reason I have just given --because here it was, I knew, that all apparent impossibilities must be proved to be not such in reality. 942678"|0|72|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7015|"""I proceeded to think thus --a posteriori. 942878"|0|73|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7016|The murderers did escape from one of these windows. 942920|1|73|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7017|I pressed it, and, satisfied with the discovery, forebore to upraise the sash. 942971|10|73|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7018|This being so, they could not have re-fastened the sashes from the inside, as they were found fastened; --the consideration which put a stop, through its obviousness, to the scrutiny of the police in this quarter. 943049|2|73|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7019|Yet the sashes were fastened. 943262|3|73|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7020|They must, then, have the power of fastening themselves. 943291|4|73|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7021|There was no escape from this conclusion. 943347|5|73|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7022|I stepped to the unobstructed casement, withdrew the nail with some difficulty, and attempted to raise the sash. 943388|6|73|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7023|It resisted all my efforts, as I had anticipated. 943500|7|73|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7024|A concealed spring must, I now knew, exist; and this corroboration of my idea convinced me that my premises, at least, were correct, however mysterious still appeared the circumstances attending the nails. 943549|8|73|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7025|A careful search soon brought to light the hidden spring. 943754|9|73|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7026|"""I now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively. 943811"|0|74|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

7030|Supposing, then, the springs upon each sash to be the same, as was probable, there must be found a difference between the nails, or at least between the modes of their fixture. 944142|4|74|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7031|Getting upon the sacking of the bedstead, I looked over the headboard minutely at the second casement. 944318|5|74|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7032|Passing my hand down behind the board, I readily discovered and pressed the spring, which was, as I had supposed, identical in character with its neighbor. 944420|6|74|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

7034|It was as stout as the other, and apparently fitted in the same manner --driven in nearly up to the head. 944600|8|74|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

7038|Pressing the spring, I gently raised the sash for a few inches; the head went up with it, remaining firm in its bed. 945034|11|75|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

7047|The fracture was an old one (for its edges were incrusted with rust), and had apparently been accomplished by the blow of a hammer, which had partially imbedded, in the top of the bottom sash, the head portion of the nail. 945865|9|75|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

7054|It was also evident that, by exertion of a very unusual degree of activity and courage, an entrance into the window, from the rod, might have been thus effected. 946764|11|77|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7055|--By reaching to the distance of two feet and a half (we now suppose the shutter open to its whole extent) a robber might have taken a firm grasp upon the trellis-work. 946925|12|77|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7056|Letting go, then, his hold upon the rod, placing his feet securely against the wall, and springing boldly from it, he might have swung the shutter so as to close it, and, if we imagine the window open at the time, might have swung himself into the room. 947093|13|77|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7057|About five feet and a half from the casement in question there runs a lightning-rod. 947346|2|77|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

7059|I observed, however, that shutters of the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by Parisian carpenters ferrades --a kind rarely employed at the present day, but frequently seen upon very old mansions at Lyons and Bordeaux. 947544|4|77|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7060|They are in the form of an ordinary door, (a single, not a folding door) except that the upper half is latticed or worked in open trellis --thus affording an excellent hold for the hands. 947774|5|77|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

7063|It is probable that the police, as well as myself, examined the back of the tenement; but, if so, in looking at these ferrades in the line of their breadth (as they must have done), they did not perceive this great breadth itself, or, at all events, failed to take it into due consideration. 948177|8|77|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

7090|Coincidences ten times as remarkable as this (the delivery of the money, and murder committed within three days upon the party receiving it), happen to all of us every hour of our lives, without attracting even momentary notice. 952176|15|81|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7091|Coincidences, in general, are great stumbling-blocks in the way of that class of thinkers who have been educated to know nothing of the theory of probabilities --that theory to which the most glorious objects of human research are indebted for the most glorious of illustration. 952404|16|81|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

7107|In the manner of thrusting the corpse up the chimney, you will that there was something excessively outre --something altogether irreconcilable with our common notions of human action, even when we suppose the actors the most depraved of men. 954181|4|82|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7108|Think, too, how great must have been that strength which could have thrust the body up such an aperture so forcibly that the united vigor of several persons was found barely sufficient to drag it down! 954423|5|82|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

7111|Monsieur Dumas, and his worthy coadjutor Monsieur Etienne, have pronounced that they were inflicted by some obtuse instrument; and so far these gentlemen are very correct. 954777|10|83|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7112|The obtuse instrument was clearly the stone pavement in the yard, upon which the victim had fAllan from the window which looked in upon the bed. 954948|11|83|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7113|This idea, however simple it may now seem, escaped the police for the same reason that the breadth of the shutters escaped them --because, by the affair of the nails, their perceptions had been hermetically sealed against the possibility of the windows have ever been opened at all. 955092|12|83|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7114|These had been torn out by the roots. 955374|2|83|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

7116|You saw the locks in question as well as myself. 955521|4|83|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

7119|The throat of the old lady was not merely cut, but the head absolutely severed from the body: the instrument was a mere razor. 955769|7|83|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

7129|Madmen are of some nation, and their language, however incoherent in its words, has always the coherence of syllabification. 956883|2|86|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

7136|It is a fac-simile drawing of what has been described in one portion of the testimony as 'dark bruises, and deep indentations of finger nails,' upon the throat of Mademoiselle L'Espanaye, and in another, (by Messrs. 957438|1|88|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

7146|He boasted to me, with a low chuckling laugh, that most men, in respect to himself, wore windows in their bosoms, and was wont to follow up such assertions by direct and very startling proofs of his intimate knowledge of my own. 958569|2|9|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

7148|His manner at these moments was frigid and abstract; his eyes were vacant in expression; while his voice, usually a rich tenor, rose into a treble which would have sounded petulantly but for the deliberateness and entire distinctness of the enunciation. 958838|3|9|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

7150|Observing him in these moods, I often dwelt meditatively upon the old philosophy of the Bi-Part Soul, and amused myself with the fancy of a double Dupin --the creative and the resolvent. 959154|4|9|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

7164|The gigantic stature, the prodigious strength and activity, the wild ferocity, and the imitative propensities of these mammalia are sufficiently well known to all. 960231|2|94|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7165|I understood the full horrors of the murder at once. 960394|3|94|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7166|"""The description of the digits,"" said I, as I made an end of reading, ""is in exact accordance with this drawing, I see that no animal but an Ourang-Outang, of the species here mentioned, could have impressed the indentations as you have traced them. 960446"|0|95|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

7168|But I cannot possibly comprehend the particulars of this frightful mystery. 960784|2|95|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

7173|Upon these two words, therefore, I have mainly built my hopes of a full solution of the riddle. 961553|2|96|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
7174|A Frenchman was cognizant of the murder. 961648|3|96|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|1841-04-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

7190|I love, indeed, to regard the dark valleys, and the gray rocks, and the waters that silently smile, and the forests that sigh in uneasy slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains that look down upon all,–I love to regard these as themselves but the colossal members of one vast animate and sentient whole–a whole whose form (that of the sphere) is the most perfect and most inclusive of all; whose path is among associate planets; whose meek handmaiden is the moon, whose mediate sovereign is the sun; whose life is eternity, whose thought is that of a God; whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destinies are lost in immensity, whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own cognizance of the animalculae which infest the brain–a being which we, in consequence, regard as purely inanimate and material much in the same manner as these animalculae must thus regard us. 963293|10|1|The Island Of The Fay|1841-06-25 00:00:00|['Fantasy']
7191|No more than any other talent, is that for music susceptible of complete enjoyment, where there is no second party to appreciate its exercise. 964163|2|1|The Island Of The Fay|1841-06-25 00:00:00|['Fantasy']
7192|And it is only in common with other talents that it produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude. 964305|3|1|The Island Of The Fay|1841-06-25 00:00:00|['Fantasy']
7193|The idea which the raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly, or has sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point, is, doubtless, the very tenable one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively alone. 964413|4|1|The Island Of The Fay|1841-06-25 00:00:00|['Fantasy']

7195|But there is one pleasure still within the reach of mortality and perhaps only one–which owes even more than does music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion. 964807|6|1|The Island Of The Fay|1841-06-25 00:00:00|['Fantasy']
7196|I mean the happiness experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery. 964967|7|1|The Island Of The Fay|1841-06-25 00:00:00|['Fantasy']

7198|To me, at least, the presence–not of human life only, but of life in any other form than that of the green things which grow upon the soil and are voiceless–is a stain upon the landscape–is at war with the genius of the scene. 965145|9|1|The Island Of The Fay|1841-06-25 00:00:00|['Fantasy']

7212|The grass wore the deep tint of the cypress, and the heads of its blades hung droopingly, and hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks, low and narrow, and not very long, that had the aspect of graves, but were not; although over and all about them the rue and the rosemary clambered. 966677|3|13|The Island Of The Fay|1841-06-25 00:00:00|['Fantasy']
7213|The shade of the trees fell heavily upon the water, and seemed to bury itself therein, impregnating the depths of the element with darkness. 966983|4|13|The Island Of The Fay|1841-06-25 00:00:00|['Fantasy']
7214|I fancied that each shadow, as the sun descended lower and lower, separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth, and thus became absorbed by the stream; while other shadows issued momently from the trees, taking the place of their predecessors thus entombed. 967123|5|13|The Island Of The Fay|1841-06-25 00:00:00|['Fantasy']

7231|And again and again she made the circuit of the island, (while the sun rushed down to his slumbers), and at each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person, while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at each passage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which became whelmed in a shadow more black. 969665|2|16|The Island Of The Fay|1841-06-25 00:00:00|['Fantasy']

7250|The little river which turned sharply in its course, and was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to have no exit from its prison, but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of the trees to the east–while in the opposite quarter (so it appeared to me as I lay at length and glanced upward) there poured down noiselessly and continuously into the valley, a rich golden and crimson waterfall from the sunset fountains of the sky. 973588|1|7|The Island Of The Fay|1841-06-25 00:00:00|['Fantasy']

7265|There were periods in each of the five or six centuries immediately preceding our dissolution, when arose some vigorous intellect, boldly contending for those principles whose truth appears now, to our disenfranchised reason, so utterly obvious; principles which should have taught our race to submit to the guidance of the natural laws, rather than attempt their control. 974942|3|13|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']

7327|After some few days of pain, and many of dreamy delirium replete with ecstasy, the manifestations of which you mistook for pain, while I longed but was impotent to undeceive you; after some days there came upon me, as you have said, a breathless and motionless torpor; and this was termed Death by those who stood around me. 982594|4|21|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7328|Words are vague things. 982918|0|22|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7329|My condition did not deprive me of sentience. 982941|1|22|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7330|It appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the extreme quiescence of him, who, having slumbered long and profoundly, lying motionless and fully prostrate in a midsummer noon, begins to steal slowly back into consciousness, through the mere sufficiency of his sleep, and without being awakened by external disturbances. 982986|2|22|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7331|I breathed no longer. 983305|0|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7332|The pulses were still. 983326|1|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7333|The hearing at the same time, although excited in degree, was not irregular in action; estimating real sounds with an extravagance of precision, not less than of sensibility. 983348|10|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7334|Touch had undergone a modification more peculiar. 983522|11|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7335|Its impressions were tardily received, but pertinaciously retained, and resulted always in the highest physical pleasure. 983571|12|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7336|Thus the pressure of your sweet fingers upon my eyelids, at first only recognized through vision, at length, long after their removal, filled my whole being with a sensual delight immeasurable. 983692|13|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7337|I say with a sensual delight. 983885|14|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7338|All my perceptions were purely sensual. 983914|15|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7339|The materials furnished the passive brain by the senses were not in the least degree wrought into shape by the deceased understanding. 983953|16|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7340|Of pain there was some little; of pleasure there was much; but of moral pain or pleasure none at all. 984087|17|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7341|Thus your wild sobs floated into my ears with all their mournful cadences, and were appreciated in their every variation of sad tone; but they were soft musical sounds and no more; they conveyed to the extinct reason no intimation of the sorrows which gave them birth; while the large and constant tears which fell upon my face, telling the bystanders of a heart which broke, thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy alone. 984188|18|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7342|And this was in truth the Death of which these bystanders spoke reverently, in low whispers; you, sweet Una, gaspingly, with loud cries. 984616|19|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7343|The heart had ceased to beat. 984752|2|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7344|Volition had not departed, but was powerless. 984781|3|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7345|The senses were unusually active, although eccentrically so; assuming often each other's functions at random. 984826|4|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7346|The taste and the smell were inextricably confounded, and became one sentiment, abnormal and intense. 984935|5|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7347|The rosewater with which your tenderness had moistened my lips to the last, affected me with sweet fancies of flowers; fantastic flowers, far more lovely than any of the old Earth, but whose prototypes we have here blooming around us. 985036|6|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7348|The eyelids, transparent and bloodless, offered no complete impediment to vision. 985270|7|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7349|As volition was in abeyance the balls could not roll in their sockets; but all objects within the range of the visual hemisphere were seen with more or less distinctness; the rays which fell upon the external retina, or into the corner of the eye, producing a more vivid effect than those which struck the front or anterior surface. 985351|8|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7350|Yet, in the former instance, this effect was so far anomalous that I appreciated it only as sound; sound sweet or discordant as the matters presenting themselves at my side were light or dark in shade; curved or angular in outline. 985683|9|23|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7351|They attired me for the coffin; three or four dark figures which flitted busily to and fro. 985914|0|24|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7352|As these crossed the direct line of my vision they affected me as forms; but upon passing to my side their images impressed me with the idea of shrieks, groans, and other dismal expressions of terror, of horror, or of wo. 986005|1|24|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7353|You alone, habited in a white robe, passed in all directions musically about me. 986226|2|24|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7354|The day waned; and, as its light faded away, I became possessed by a vague uneasiness; an anxiety such as the sleeper feels when sad real sounds fall continuously within his ear; low distant bell tones, solemn, at long but equal intervals, and commingling with melancholy dreams. 986306|0|25|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7355|Night arrived; and with its shadows a heavy discomfort. 986585|1|25|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7356|It oppressed my limbs with the oppression of some dull weight, and was palpable. 986640|2|25|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7357|There was also a moaning sound, not unlike the distant reverberation of surf, but more continuous, which beginning with the first twilight, had grown in strength with the darkness. 986720|3|25|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7358|Suddenly lights were brought into the room, and this reverberation became forthwith interrupted into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound, but less dreary and less distinct. 986900|4|25|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7359|The ponderous oppression was in a great measure relieved; and, issuing from the flame of each lamp, (for there were many,) there flowed unbrokenly into my ears a strain of melodious monotone. 987078|5|25|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7360|And when now, dear Una, approaching the bed upon which I lay outstretched, you sat gently by my side, breathing odor from your sweet lips, and pressing them upon my brow, there arose tremulously within my bosom, and mingling with the merely physical sensations which circumstances had called forth, a something akin to sentiment itself; a feeling that, half appreciating, half responded to your earnest love and sorrow,; but this feeling took no root in the pulseless heart, and seemed indeed rather a shadow than a reality, and faded quickly away, first into extreme quiescence, and then into a purely sensual pleasure as before. 987269|6|25|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7361|And now, from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses, there appeared to have arisen within me a sixth, all perfect. 987899|0|26|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7362|In its exercise I found a wild delight yet a delight still physical, inasmuch as the understanding had in it no part. 988019|1|26|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7363|The slightest deviation from the true proportion; and these deviations were omni-prevalent; affected me just as violations of abstract truth were wont, on earth, to affect the moral sense. 988136|10|26|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7364|Although no two of the time-pieces in the chamber struck individual seconds accurately together, yet I had no difficulty in holding steadily in mind the tones, and the respective momentary errors of each. 988324|11|26|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7365|And this; this keen, perfect, self-existing sentiment of duration; this sentiment existing (as man could not possibly have conceived it to exist) independently of any succession of events; this idea; this sixth sense, upspringing from the ashes of the rest, was the first obvious and certain step of the intemporal soul upon the threshold of the temporal Eternity. 988528|12|26|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7366|Motion in the animal frame had fully ceased. 988892|2|26|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7367|No muscle quivered; no nerve thrilled; no artery throbbed. 988936|3|26|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7368|But there seemed to have sprung up in the brain, that of which no words could convey to the merely human intelligence even an indistinct conception. 988994|4|26|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7369|Let me term it a mental pendulous pulsation. 989142|5|26|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7370|It was the moral embodiment of man's abstract idea of Time. 989186|6|26|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7371|By the absolute equalization of this movement; or of such as this; had the cycles of the firmamental orbs themselves, been adjusted. 989245|7|26|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7372|By its aid I measured the irregularities of the clock upon the mantel, and of the watches of the attendants. 989377|8|26|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7373|Their tickings came sonorously to my ears. 989485|9|26|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7374|It was midnight; and you still sat by my side. 989527|0|27|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7375|All others had departed from the chamber of Death. 989573|1|27|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7376|All of what man has termed sense was merged in the sole consciousness of entity, and in the one abiding sentiment of duration. 989623|10|27|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7377|The mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of the deadly Decay. 989749|11|27|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7378|They had deposited me in the coffin. 989827|2|27|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7379|The lamps burned flickeringly; for this I knew by the tremulousness of the monotonous strains. 989863|3|27|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7380|But, suddenly these strains diminished in distinctness and in volume. 989957|4|27|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7381|Finally they ceased. 990026|5|27|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7382|The perfume in my nostrils died away. 990046|6|27|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7383|Forms affected my vision no longer. 990083|7|27|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7384|The oppression of the Darkness uplifted itself from my bosom. 990118|8|27|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7385|A dull shock like that of electricity pervaded my frame, and was followed by total loss of the idea of contact. 990179|9|27|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7386|Yet had not all of sentience departed; for the consciousness and the sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a lethargic intuition. 990290|0|28|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7387|I appreciated the direful change now in operation upon the flesh, and, as the dreamer is sometimes aware of the bodily presence of one who leans over him, so, sweet Una, I still dully felt that you sat by my side. 990435|1|28|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7388|So, too, when the noon of the second day came, I was not unconscious of those movements which displaced you from my side, which confined me within the coffin, which deposited me within the hearse, which bore me to the grave, which lowered me within it, which heaped heavily the mould upon me, and which thus left me, in blackness and corruption, to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm. 990648|2|28|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7389|And here, in the prison-house which has few secrets to disclose, they rolled away days and weeks and months; and the soul watched narrowly each second as it flew, and, without effort, took record of its flight; without effort and without object. 991038|0|29|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7390|MONOS. 991283|0|3|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7391|"Yes, fairest and best beloved Una, ""born again"". 991289"|1|3|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7392|These were the words upon whose mystical meaning I had so long pondered, rejecting the explanations of the priesthood, until Death itself resolved for me the secret. 991337|2|3|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7393|A year passed. 991502|0|30|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7394|The consciousness of being had grown hourly more indistinct, and that of mere locality had, in great measure, usurped its position. 991516|1|30|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7395|The idea of entity was becoming merged in that of place. 991647|2|30|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7396|The narrow space immediately surrounding what had been the body, was now growing to be the body itself. 991703|3|30|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7397|At length, as often happens to the sleeper (by sleep and its world alone is Death imaged); at length, as sometimes happened on Earth to the deep slumberer, when some flitting light half startled him into awaking, yet left him half enveloped in dreams; so to me, in the strict embrace of the Shadow, came that light which alone might have had power to startle; the light of enduring Love. 991806|4|30|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7398|Men toiled at the grave in which I lay darkling. 992193|5|30|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7399|They upthrew the damp earth. 992241|6|30|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7400|Upon my mouldering bones there descended the coffin of UNA. 992269|7|30|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7401|And now again all was void. 992328|0|31|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7402|That nebulous light had been extinguished. 992355|1|31|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7403|That feeble thrill had vibrated itself into quiescence. 992397|2|31|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7404|Many lustra had supervened. 992452|3|31|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7405|Dust had returned to dust. 992479|4|31|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7406|The worm had food no more. 992505|5|31|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7407|The sense of being at length utterly departed, and there reigned in its stead; instead of all things- dominant and perpetual; the autocrats Place and Time. 992531|6|31|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7408|For that which was not; for that which had no form; for that which had no thought- for that which had no sentience; for that which was soulless, yet of which matter formed no portion; for all this nothingness, yet for all this immortality, the grave was still a home, and the corrosive hours, co-mates. 992686|7|31|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7409|UNA. 992988|0|4|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']

7411|MONOS. 992998|0|5|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7412|How strangely, sweet Una, you echo my words! 993004|1|5|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7413|I observe, too, a vacillation in your step, a joyous inquietude in your eyes. 993048|2|5|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7414|You are confused and oppressed by the majestic novelty of the Life Eternal. 993125|3|5|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7415|Yes, it was of Death I spoke. 993200|4|5|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7416|And here how singularly sounds that word which of old was wont to bring terror to all hearts, throwing a mildew upon all pleasures! 993229|5|5|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']

7419|How often, Monos, did we lose ourselves in speculations upon its nature! 993412|2|6|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7420|"How mysteriously did it act as a check to human bliss, saying unto it ""thus far and no further""! 993484"|3|6|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7421|That earnest mutual love, my own Monos, which burned within our bosoms; how vainly did we flatter ourselves, feeling happy in its first upspringing, that our happiness would strengthen with its strength! 993580|4|6|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7422|Alas! 993783|5|6|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7423|as it grew, so grew in our hearts the dread of that evil hour which was hurrying to separate us forever! 993788|6|6|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7424|Thus, in time, it became painful to love. 993892|7|6|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
7425|Hate would have been mercy then. 993933|8|6|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']

7428|UNA. 994037|0|8|The Colloquy Of Monos And Una|1841-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']

7536|The stile was not very high, like Mr. Lord's–nor yet very low, like that of Mr. Lord's reviewers, but upon the whole I made sure that he would clear it. 1006275|1|25|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']

7543|The bridge, as I say, was arched and covered in, in a very ridiculous manner, and there was a most uncomfortable echo about it at all times–an echo which I never before so particularly observed as when I uttered the four last words of my remark. 1006711|8|25|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7544|But what I said, or what I thought, or what I heard, occupied only an instant. 1006956|0|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7545|In less than five seconds from his starting, my poor Toby had taken the leap. 1007034|1|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7546|About five feet just above the top of the turnstile, and crossing the arch of the foot-path so as to constitute a brace, there extended a flat iron bar, lying with its breadth horizontally, and forming one of a series that served to strengthen the structure throughout its extent. 1007111|10|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7547|With the edge of this brace it appeared evident that the neck of my unfortunate friend had come precisely in contact. 1007391|11|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7548|I saw him run nimbly, and spring grandly from the floor of the bridge, cutting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he went up. 1007508|2|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7549|I saw him high in the air, pigeon-winging it to admiration just over the top of the stile; and of course I thought it an unusually singular thing that he did not continue to go over. 1007641|3|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7550|But the whole leap was the affair of a moment, and, before I had a chance to make any profound reflections, down came Mr. Dammit on the flat of his back, on the same side of the stile from which he had started. 1007823|4|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7551|At the same instant I saw the old gentleman limping off at the top of his speed, having caught and wrapt up in his apron something that fell heavily into it from the darkness of the arch just over the turnstile. 1008033|5|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7552|At all this I was much astonished; but I had no leisure to think, for Dammit lay particularly still, and I concluded that his feelings had been hurt, and that he stood in need of my assistance. 1008244|6|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7553|I hurried up to him and found that he had received what might be termed a serious injury. 1008437|7|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7554|The truth is, he had been deprived of his head, which after a close search I could not find anywhere; so I determined to take him home and send for the homoeopathists. 1008526|8|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7555|In the meantime a thought struck me, and I threw open an adjacent window of the bridge, when the sad truth flashed upon me at once. 1008693|9|26|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7556|He did not long survive his terrible loss. 1008824|0|27|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7557|The homoeopathists did not give him little enough physic, and what little they did give him he hesitated to take. 1008866|1|27|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7558|So in the end he grew worse, and at length died, a lesson to all riotous livers. 1008979|2|27|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7559|I bedewed his grave with my tears, worked a bar sinister on his family escutcheon, and, for the general expenses of his funeral, sent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists. 1009059|3|27|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7560|The scoundrels refused to pay it, so I had Mr. Dammit dug up at once, and sold him for dog's meat. 1009244|4|27|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7561|The fact is that his precocity in vice was awful. 1009342|0|3|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7562|At five months of age he used to get into such passions that he was unable to articulate. 1009391|1|3|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7563|At six months, I caught him gnawing a pack of cards. 1009480|2|3|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7564|At seven months he was in the constant habit of catching and kissing the female babies. 1009532|3|3|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7565|At eight months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the Temperance pledge. 1009619|4|3|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7566|Thus he went on increasing in iniquity, month after month, until, at the close of the first year, he not only insisted upon wearing moustaches, but had contracted a propensity for cursing and swearing, and for backing his assertions by bets. 1009705|5|3|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7567|Through this latter most ungentlemanly practice, the ruin which I had predicted to Toby Dammit overtook him at last. 1009946|0|4|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']

7571|I remonstrated–but to no purpose. 1010421|12|4|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7572|I demonstrated–in vain. 1010454|13|4|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']

7576|I threatened–he swore. 1010544|17|4|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7577|I kicked him–he called for the police. 1010566|18|4|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7578|I pulled his nose–he blew it, and offered to bet the Devil his head that I would not venture to try that experiment again. 1010604|19|4|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']

7582|His expressions on this head had no meaning attached to them whatever. 1010890|5|4|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7583|They were simple if not altogether innocent expletives–imaginative phrases wherewith to round off a sentence. 1010960|6|4|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7584|"When he said ""I'll bet you so and so,"" nobody ever thought of taking him up; but still I could not help thinking it my duty to put him down. 1011069"|7|4|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7585|The habit was an immoral one, and so I told him. 1011209|8|4|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7586|It was a vulgar one–this I begged him to believe. 1011257|9|4|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7587|Poverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of Dammit's mother had entailed upon her son. 1011306|0|5|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7588|He was detestably poor, and this was the reason, no doubt, that his expletive expressions about betting, seldom took a pecuniary turn. 1011415|1|5|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']

7591|This latter form seemed to please him best;–perhaps because it involved the least risk; for Dammit had become excessively parsimonious. 1011833|0|6|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
7592|Had any one taken him up, his head was small, and thus his loss would have been small too. 1011968|1|6|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']

7599|At all events the phrase in question grew daily in favor, notwithstanding the gross impropriety of a man betting his brains like bank-notes:–but this was a point which my friend's perversity of disposition would not permit him to comprehend. 1012520|3|6|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']

7603|The truth is, there was something in the air with which Mr. Dammit was wont to give utterance to his offensive expression–something in his manner of enunciation–which at first interested, and afterwards made me very uneasy–something which, for want of a more definite term at present, I must be permitted to call queer; but which Mr. Coleridge would have called mystical, Mr. Kant pantheistical, Mr. Carlyle twistical, and Mr. Emerson hyperquizzitistical. 1013084|7|6|Never Bet The Devil Your Head|1841-09-25 00:00:00|['Satire']

7678|"A very ""fine old English gentleman,"" was my grand-uncle Rumgudgeon, but unlike him of the song, he had his weak points. 1016930"|0|18|Three Sundays In A Week|1841-11-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
7679|He was a little, pursy, pompous, passionate semicircular somebody, with a red nose, a thick scull, [sic] a long purse, and a strong sense of his own consequence. 1017049|1|18|Three Sundays In A Week|1841-11-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
7680|With the best heart in the world, he contrived, through a predominant whim of contradiction, to earn for himself, among those who only knew him superficially, the character of a curmudgeon. 1017210|2|18|Three Sundays In A Week|1841-11-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
7681|Like many excellent people, he seemed possessed with a spirit of tantalization, which might easily, at a casual glance, have been mistaken for malevolence. 1017399|3|18|Three Sundays In A Week|1841-11-27 00:00:00|['Humor']

7684|Against all attacks upon his purse he made the most sturdy defence; but the amount extorted from him, at last, was generally in direct ratio with the length of the siege and the stubbornness of the resistance. 1017704|6|18|Three Sundays In A Week|1841-11-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
7685|In charity no one gave more liberally or with a worse grace. 1017913|7|18|Three Sundays In A Week|1841-11-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
7686|For the fine arts, and especially for the belles-lettres, he entertained a profound contempt. 1017973|0|19|Three Sundays In A Week|1841-11-27 00:00:00|['Humor']

7688|he was in the habit of quoting, with a very droll pronunciation, as the ne plus ultra of logical wit. 1018169|2|19|Three Sundays In A Week|1841-11-27 00:00:00|['Humor']

7692|Somebody had accosted him in the street, mistaking him for no less a personage than Doctor Dubble L. Dee, the lecturer upon quack physics. 1018670|6|19|Three Sundays In A Week|1841-11-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
7693|This set him off at a tangent; and just at the epoch of this story–for story it is getting to be after all–my grand-uncle Rumgudgeon was accessible and pacific only upon points which happened to chime in with the caprioles of the hobby he was riding. 1018808|7|19|Three Sundays In A Week|1841-11-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
7694|For the rest, he laughed with his arms and legs, and his politics were stubborn and easily understood. 1019058|8|19|Three Sundays In A Week|1841-11-27 00:00:00|['Humor']

7703|Here was a piece de resistance (as Messieurs Ude and Careme would say) which suited his perverse fancy to a T.

7706|In fact, he would have given ten thousand pounds from his own pocket (Kate's plum was her own) if he could have invented any thing like an excuse for complying with our very natural wishes. 1020287|17|20|Three Sundays In A Week|1841-11-27 00:00:00|['Humor']

7710|From my first year until my fifth, he obliged me with very regular floggings. 1020782|3|20|Three Sundays In A Week|1841-11-27 00:00:00|['Humor']

7723|Now it was this latter peculiarity in his disposition, of which Kates ingenuity enabled us one fine day, not long after our interview in the dining-room, to take a very unexpected advantage, and, having thus, in the fashion of all modern bards and orators, exhausted in prolegomena, all the time at my command, and nearly all the room at my disposal, I will sum up in a few words what constitutes the whole pith of the story. 1021979|6|21|Three Sundays In A Week|1841-11-27 00:00:00|['Humor']

7875|In other conditions of mind I might have had courage to end my misery at once by a plunge into one of these abysses; but now I was the veriest of cowards. 1031809|1|14|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7876|Neither could I forget what I had read of these pits --that the sudden extinction of life formed no part of their most horrible plan. 1031963|2|14|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7877|Agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours; but at length I again slumbered. 1032096|0|15|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7878|Upon arousing, I found by my side, as before, a loaf and a pitcher of water. 1032183|1|15|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7879|A burning thirst consumed me, and I emptied the vessel at a draught. 1032259|2|15|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7880|It must have been drugged; for scarcely had I drunk, before I became irresistibly drowsy. 1032327|3|15|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7881|A deep sleep fell upon me --a sleep like that of death. 1032416|4|15|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7882|How long it lasted of course, I know not; but when, once again, I unclosed my eyes, the objects around me were visible. 1032471|5|15|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7883|By a wild sulphurous lustre, the origin of which I could not at first determine, I was enabled to see the extent and aspect of the prison. 1032590|6|15|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7884|In its size I had been greatly mistaken. 1032728|0|16|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7885|The whole circuit of its walls did not exceed twenty-five yards. 1032768|1|16|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7886|For some minutes this fact occasioned me a world of vain trouble; vain indeed! 1032832|2|16|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7887|for what could be of less importance, under the terrible circumstances which environed me, then the mere dimensions of my dungeon? 1032910|3|16|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7888|But my soul took a wild interest in trifles, and I busied myself in endeavors to account for the error I had committed in my measurement. 1033040|4|16|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7889|The truth at length flashed upon me. 1033177|5|16|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7890|In my first attempt at exploration I had counted fifty-two paces, up to the period when I fell; I must then have been within a pace or two of the fragment of serge; in fact, I had nearly performed the circuit of the vault. 1033213|6|16|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7891|I then slept, and upon awaking, I must have returned upon my steps --thus supposing the circuit nearly double what it actually was. 1033435|7|16|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7892|My confusion of mind prevented me from observing that I began my tour with the wall to the left, and ended it with the wall to the right. 1033566|8|16|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7893|I had been deceived, too, in respect to the shape of the enclosure. 1033703|0|17|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7894|In feeling my way I had found many angles, and thus deduced an idea of great irregularity; so potent is the effect of total darkness upon one arousing from lethargy or sleep! 1033770|1|17|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7895|The angles were simply those of a few slight depressions, or niches, at odd intervals. 1033944|2|17|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7896|The general shape of the prison was square. 1034030|3|17|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7897|What I had taken for masonry seemed now to be iron, or some other metal, in huge plates, whose sutures or joints occasioned the depression. 1034073|4|17|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7898|The entire surface of this metallic enclosure was rudely daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which the charnel superstition of the monks has given rise. 1034212|5|17|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7899|The figures of fiends in aspects of menace, with skeleton forms, and other more really fearful images, overspread and disfigured the walls. 1034379|6|17|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7900|I observed that the outlines of these monstrosities were sufficiently distinct, but that the colors seemed faded and blurred, as if from the effects of a damp atmosphere. 1034518|7|17|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7901|I now noticed the floor, too, which was of stone. 1034688|8|17|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7902|In the centre yawned the circular pit from whose jaws I had escaped; but it was the only one in the dungeon. 1034737|9|17|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7903|All this I saw indistinctly and by much effort: for my personal condition had been greatly changed during slumber. 1034845|0|18|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7904|I now lay upon my back, and at full length, on a species of low framework of wood. 1034959|1|18|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7905|To this I was securely bound by a long strap resembling a surcingle. 1035041|2|18|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7906|It passed in many convolutions about my limbs and body, leaving at liberty only my head, and my left arm to such extent that I could, by dint of much exertion, supply myself with food from an earthen dish which lay by my side on the floor. 1035109|3|18|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7907|I saw, to my horror, that the pitcher had been removed. 1035348|4|18|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7908|I say to my horror; for I was consumed with intolerable thirst. 1035403|5|18|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7909|This thirst it appeared to be the design of my persecutors to stimulate: for the food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned. 1035466|6|18|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7910|Looking upward, I surveyed the ceiling of my prison. 1035592|0|19|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7911|It was some thirty or forty feet overhead, and constructed much as the side walls. 1035644|1|19|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7912|In one of its panels a very singular figure riveted my whole attention. 1035726|2|19|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7913|It was the painted figure of Time as he is commonly represented, save that, in lieu of a scythe, he held what, at a casual glance, I supposed to be the pictured image of a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks. 1035797|3|19|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7914|There was something, however, in the appearance of this machine which caused me to regard it more attentively. 1036016|4|19|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7915|While I gazed directly upward at it (for its position was immediately over my own) I fancied that I saw it in motion. 1036126|5|19|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7916|In an instant afterward the fancy was confirmed. 1036243|6|19|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7917|Its sweep was brief, and of course slow. 1036291|7|19|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7918|I watched it for some minutes, somewhat in fear, but more in wonder. 1036331|8|19|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7919|Wearied at length with observing its dull movement, I turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell. 1036399|9|19|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7920|I WAS sick --sick unto death with that long agony; and when they at length unbound me, and I was permitted to sit, I felt that my senses were leaving me. 1036503|0|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7921|The sentence --the dread sentence of death --was the last of distinct accentuation which reached my ears. 1036656|1|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7922|I saw them fashion the syllables of my name; and I shuddered because no sound succeeded. 1036761|10|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7923|I saw, too, for a few moments of delirious horror, the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable draperies which enwrapped the walls of the apartment. 1036849|11|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7924|And then my vision fell upon the seven tall candles upon the table. 1037007|12|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7925|At first they wore the aspect of charity, and seemed white and slender angels who would save me; but then, all at once, there came a most deadly nausea over my spirit, and I felt every fibre in my frame thrill as if I had touched the wire of a galvanic battery, while the angel forms became meaningless spectres, with heads of flame, and I saw that from them there would be no help. 1037074|13|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7926|And then there stole into my fancy, like a rich musical note, the thought of what sweet rest there must be in the grave. 1037456|14|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7927|The thought came gently and stealthily, and it seemed long before it attained full appreciation; but just as my spirit came at length properly to feel and entertain it, the figures of the judges vanished, as if magically, from before me; the tall candles sank into nothingness; their flames went out utterly; the blackness of darkness supervened; all sensations appeared swallowed up in a mad rushing descent as of the soul into Hades. 1037576|15|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7928|Then silence, and stillness, night were the universe. 1038011|16|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7929|After that, the sound of the inquisitorial voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum. 1038064|2|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7930|It conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution --perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a mill wheel. 1038160|3|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7931|This only for a brief period; for presently I heard no more. 1038276|4|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7932|Yet, for a while, I saw; but with how terrible an exaggeration! 1038336|5|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7933|I saw the lips of the black-robed judges. 1038399|6|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7934|They appeared to me white --whiter than the sheet upon which I trace these words --and thin even to grotesqueness; thin with the intensity of their expression of firmness --of immoveable resolution --of stern contempt of human torture. 1038440|7|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7935|I saw that the decrees of what to me was Fate, were still issuing from those lips. 1038675|8|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7936|I saw them writhe with a deadly locution. 1038757|9|2|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7937|A slight noise attracted my notice, and, looking to the floor, I saw several enormous rats traversing it. 1038798|0|20|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7938|They had issued from the well, which lay just within view to my right. 1038903|1|20|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7939|Even then, while I gazed, they came up in troops, hurriedly, with ravenous eyes, allured by the scent of the meat. 1038973|2|20|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7940|From this it required much effort and attention to scare them away. 1039087|3|20|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7941|It might have been half an hour, perhaps even an hour, (for in cast my I could take but imperfect note of time) before I again cast my eyes upward. 1039154|0|21|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7942|What I then saw confounded and amazed me. 1039301|1|21|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7943|The sweep of the pendulum had increased in extent by nearly a yard. 1039342|2|21|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7944|As a natural consequence, its velocity was also much greater. 1039409|3|21|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7945|But what mainly disturbed me was the idea that had perceptibly descended. 1039470|4|21|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7946|I now observed --with what horror it is needless to say --that its nether extremity was formed of a crescent of glittering steel, about a foot in length from horn to horn; the horns upward, and the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor. 1039543|5|21|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7947|Like a razor also, it seemed massy and heavy, tapering from the edge into a solid and broad structure above. 1039789|6|21|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7948|It was appended to a weighty rod of brass, and the whole hissed as it swung through the air. 1039897|7|21|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7949|I could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish ingenuity in torture. 1039989|0|22|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7950|My cognizance of the pit had become known to the inquisitorial agents --the pit whose horrors had been destined for so bold a recusant as myself --the pit, typical of hell, and regarded by rumor as the Ultima Thule of all their punishments. 1040070|1|22|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7951|The plunge into this pit I had avoided by the merest of accidents, I knew that surprise, or entrapment into torment, formed an important portion of all the grotesquerie of these dungeon deaths. 1040310|2|22|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7952|Having failed to fall, it was no part of the demon plan to hurl me into the abyss; and thus (there being no alternative) a different and a milder destruction awaited me. 1040503|3|22|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7953|Milder! 1040672|4|22|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7954|I half smiled in my agony as I thought of such application of such a term. 1040679|5|22|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7955|What boots it to tell of the long, long hours of horror more than mortal, during which I counted the rushing vibrations of the steel! 1040753|0|23|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7956|Inch by inch --line by line --with a descent only appreciable at intervals that seemed ages --down and still down it came! 1040886|1|23|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7957|Days passed --it might have been that many days passed --ere it swept so closely over me as to fan me with its acrid breath. 1041008|2|23|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7958|The odor of the sharp steel forced itself into my nostrils. 1041132|3|23|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7959|I prayed --I wearied heaven with my prayer for its more speedy descent. 1041191|4|23|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7960|I grew frantically mad, and struggled to force myself upward against the sweep of the fearful scimitar. 1041262|5|23|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7961|And then I fell suddenly calm, and lay smiling at the glittering death, as a child at some rare bauble. 1041365|6|23|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7962|There was another interval of utter insensibility; it was brief; for, upon again lapsing into life there had been no perceptible descent in the pendulum. 1041468|0|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7963|But it might have been long; for I knew there were demons who took note of my swoon, and who could have arrested the vibration at pleasure. 1041621|1|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7964|Long suffering had nearly annihilated all my ordinary powers of mind. 1041760|10|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7965|I was an imbecile --an idiot. 1041829|11|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7966|Upon my recovery, too, I felt very --oh, inexpressibly sick and weak, as if through long inanition. 1041858|2|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7967|Even amid the agonies of that period, the human nature craved food. 1041957|3|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7968|With painful effort I outstretched my left arm as far as my bonds permitted, and took possession of the small remnant which had been spared me by the rats. 1042024|4|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7969|As I put a portion of it within my lips, there rushed to my mind a half formed thought of joy --of hope. 1042179|5|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7970|Yet what business had I with hope? 1042283|6|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7971|It was, as I say, a half formed thought --man has many such which are never completed. 1042317|7|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7972|I felt that it was of joy --of hope; but felt also that it had perished in its formation. 1042403|8|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7973|In vain I struggled to perfect --to regain it. 1042492|9|24|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7974|The vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my length. 1042538|0|25|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7975|I saw that the crescent was designed to cross the region of the heart. 1042601|1|25|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7976|It would fray the serge of my robe --it would return and repeat its operations --again --and again. 1042671|2|25|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7977|Notwithstanding terrifically wide sweep (some thirty feet or more) and the its hissing vigor of its descent, sufficient to sunder these very walls of iron, still the fraying of my robe would be all that, for several minutes, it would accomplish. 1042770|3|25|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7978|And at this thought I paused. 1043015|4|25|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7979|I dared not go farther than this reflection. 1043044|5|25|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7980|I dwelt upon it with a pertinacity of attention --as if, in so dwelling, I could arrest here the descent of the steel. 1043088|6|25|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7981|I forced myself to ponder upon the sound of the crescent as it should pass across the garment --upon the peculiar thrilling sensation which the friction of cloth produces on the nerves. 1043206|7|25|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7982|I pondered upon all this frivolity until my teeth were on edge. 1043391|8|25|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7983|Down --steadily down it crept. 1043454|0|26|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7984|I took a frenzied pleasure in contrasting its downward with its lateral velocity. 1043484|1|26|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7985|To the right --to the left --far and wide --with the shriek of a damned spirit; to my heart with the stealthy pace of the tiger! 1043565|2|26|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7986|I alternately laughed and howled as the one or the other idea grew predominant. 1043693|3|26|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7987|Down --certainly, relentlessly down! 1043772|0|27|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7988|It vibrated within three inches of my bosom! 1043808|1|27|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7989|I struggled violently, furiously, to free my left arm. 1043852|2|27|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7990|This was free only from the elbow to the hand. 1043906|3|27|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7991|I could reach the latter, from the platter beside me, to my mouth, with great effort, but no farther. 1043952|4|27|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7992|Could I have broken the fastenings above the elbow, I would have seized and attempted to arrest the pendulum. 1044053|5|27|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7993|I might as well have attempted to arrest an avalanche! 1044162|6|27|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7994|Down --still unceasingly --still inevitably down! 1044216|0|28|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7995|I gasped and struggled at each vibration. 1044265|1|28|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7996|I shrunk convulsively at its every sweep. 1044306|2|28|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7997|My eyes followed its outward or upward whirls with the eagerness of the most unmeaning despair; they closed themselves spasmodically at the descent, although death would have been a relief, oh! 1044347|3|28|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7998|how unspeakable! 1044540|4|28|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
7999|Still I quivered in every nerve to think how slight a sinking of the machinery would precipitate that keen, glistening axe upon my bosom. 1044556|5|28|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8000|It was hope that prompted the nerve to quiver --the frame to shrink. 1044693|6|28|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8001|It was hope --the hope that triumphs on the rack --that whispers to the death-condemned even in the dungeons of the Inquisition. 1044761|7|28|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8002|I saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in actual contact with my robe, and with this observation there suddenly came over my spirit all the keen, collected calmness of despair. 1044889|0|29|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8003|For the first time during many hours --or perhaps days --I thought. 1045089|1|29|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8004|The surcingle enveloped my limbs and body close in all directions--save in the path of the destroying crescent. 1045156|10|29|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8005|It now occurred to me that the bandage, or surcingle, which enveloped me, was unique. 1045267|2|29|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8006|I was tied by no separate cord. 1045352|3|29|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8007|The first stroke of the razorlike crescent athwart any portion of the band, would so detach it that it might be unwound from my person by means of my left hand. 1045383|4|29|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8008|But how fearful, in that case, the proximity of the steel! 1045543|5|29|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8009|The result of the slightest struggle how deadly! 1045601|6|29|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8010|Was it likely, moreover, that the minions of the torturer had not foreseen and provided for this possibility! 1045649|7|29|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8011|Was it probable that the bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the pendulum? 1045758|8|29|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8012|Dreading to find my faint, and, as it seemed, in last hope frustrated, I so far elevated my head as to obtain a distinct view of my breast. 1045837|9|29|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8013|I had swooned; but still will not say that all of consciousness was lost. 1045976|0|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8014|What of it there remained I will not attempt to define, or even to describe; yet all was not lost. 1046049|1|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8015|In the return to life from the swoon there are two stages; first, that of the sense of mental or spiritual; secondly, that of the sense of physical, existence. 1046147|10|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8016|It seems probable that if, upon reaching the second stage, we could recall the impressions of the first, we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of the gulf beyond. 1046306|11|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8017|And that gulf is --what? 1046484|12|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8018|How at least shall we distinguish its shadows from those of the tomb? 1046508|13|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8019|But if the impressions of what I have termed the first stage, are not, at will, recalled, yet, after long interval, do they not come unbidden, while we marvel whence they come? 1046577|14|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8020|He who has never swooned, is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly familiar faces in coals that glow; is not he who beholds floating in mid-air the sad visions that the many may not view; is not he who ponders over the perfume of some novel flower --is not he whose brain grows bewildered with the meaning of some musical cadence which has never before arrested his attention. 1046753|15|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8021|In the deepest slumber --no! 1047135|2|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8022|In delirium --no! 1047163|3|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8023|In a swoon --no! 1047180|4|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8024|In death --no! 1047196|5|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8025|even in the grave all is not lost. 1047210|6|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8026|Else there is no immortality for man. 1047244|7|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8027|Arousing from the most profound of slumbers, we break the gossamer web of some dream. 1047281|8|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8028|Yet in a second afterward, (so frail may that web have been) we remember not that we have dreamed. 1047366|9|3|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8029|Scarcely had I dropped my head back into its original position, when there flashed upon my mind what I cannot better describe than as the unformed half of that idea of deliverance to which I have previously alluded, and of which a moiety only floated indeterminately through my brain when I raised food to my burning lips. 1047464|0|30|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8030|The whole thought was now present --feeble, scarcely sane, scarcely definite, --but still entire. 1047786|1|30|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8031|I proceeded at once, with the nervous energy of despair, to attempt its execution. 1047883|2|30|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8032|For many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon which I lay, had been literally swarming with rats. 1047965|0|31|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8033|They were wild, bold, ravenous; their red eyes glaring upon me as if they waited but for motionlessness on my part to make me their prey. 1048080|1|31|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8034|"""To what food,"" I thought, ""have they been accustomed in the well""? 1048217"|2|31|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8035|They had devoured, in spite of all my efforts to prevent them, all but a small remnant of the contents of the dish. 1048284|0|32|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8036|I had fAllan into an habitual see-saw, or wave of the hand about the platter: and, at length, the unconscious uniformity of the movement deprived it of effect. 1048399|1|32|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8037|In their voracity the vermin frequently fastened their sharp fangs in my fingers. 1048558|2|32|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8038|With the particles of the oily and spicy viand which now remained, I thoroughly rubbed the bandage wherever I could reach it; then, raising my hand from the floor, I lay breathlessly still. 1048639|3|32|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8039|At first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the change --at the cessation of movement. 1048828|0|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8040|They shrank alarmedly back; many sought the well. 1048931|1|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8041|They pressed --they swarmed upon me in ever accumulating heaps. 1048980|10|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8042|They writhed upon my throat; their cold lips sought my own; I was half stifled by their thronging pressure; disgust, for which the world has no name, swelled my bosom, and chilled, with a heavy clamminess, my heart. 1049043|11|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8043|Yet one minute, and I felt that the struggle would be over. 1049258|12|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8044|Plainly I perceived the loosening of the bandage. 1049317|13|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8045|I knew that in more than one place it must be already severed. 1049366|14|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8046|With a more than human resolution I lay still. 1049428|15|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8047|But this was only for a moment. 1049474|2|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8048|I had not counted in vain upon their voracity. 1049505|3|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8049|Observing that I remained without motion, one or two of the boldest leaped upon the frame-work, and smelt at the surcingle. 1049551|4|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8050|This seemed the signal for a general rush. 1049674|5|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8051|Forth from the well they hurried in fresh troops. 1049716|6|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8052|They clung to the wood --they overran it, and leaped in hundreds upon my person. 1049765|7|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8053|The measured movement of the pendulum disturbed them not at all. 1049845|8|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8054|Avoiding its strokes they busied themselves with the anointed bandage. 1049909|9|33|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8055|Nor had I erred in my calculations --nor had I endured in vain. 1049979|0|34|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8056|I at length felt that I was free. 1050042|1|34|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8057|For the moment, at least, I was free. 1050075|10|34|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8058|The surcingle hung in ribands from my body. 1050112|2|34|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8059|But the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon my bosom. 1050155|3|34|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8060|It had divided the serge of the robe. 1050216|4|34|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8061|It had cut through the linen beneath. 1050253|5|34|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8062|Twice again it swung, and a sharp sense of pain shot through every nerve. 1050290|6|34|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8063|But the moment of escape had arrived. 1050363|7|34|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8064|At a wave of my hand my deliverers hurried tumultuously away. 1050400|8|34|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8065|With a steady movement --cautious, sidelong, shrinking, and slow --I slid from the embrace of the bandage and beyond the reach of the scimitar. 1050461|9|34|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8066|Free! 1050604|0|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8067|--and in the grasp of the Inquisition! 1050609|1|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8068|During this period, I became aware, for the first time, of the origin of the sulphurous light which illumined the cell. 1050647|10|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8069|It proceeded from a fissure, about half an inch in width, extending entirely around the prison at the base of the walls, which thus appeared, and were, completely separated from the floor. 1050766|11|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8070|I endeavored, but of course in vain, to look through the aperture. 1050954|12|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8071|I had scarcely stepped from my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison, when the motion of the hellish machine ceased and I beheld it drawn up, by some invisible force, through the ceiling. 1051020|2|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8072|This was a lesson which I took desperately to heart. 1051225|3|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8073|My every motion was undoubtedly watched. 1051277|4|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8074|Free! 1051317|5|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8075|--I had but escaped death in one form of agony, to be delivered unto worse than death in some other. 1051322|6|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8076|With that thought I rolled my eves nervously around on the barriers of iron that hemmed me in. 1051422|7|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8077|Something unusual --some change which, at first, I could not appreciate distinctly --it was obvious, had taken place in the apartment. 1051516|8|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8078|For many minutes of a dreamy and trembling abstraction, I busied myself in vain, unconnected conjecture. 1051650|9|35|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8079|As I arose from the attempt, the mystery of the alteration in the chamber broke at once upon my understanding. 1051754|0|36|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8080|I have observed that, although the outlines of the figures upon the walls were sufficiently distinct, yet the colors seemed blurred and indefinite. 1051864|1|36|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8081|These colors had now assumed, and were momentarily assuming, a startling and most intense brilliancy, that gave to the spectral and fiendish portraitures an aspect that might have thrilled even firmer nerves than my own. 1052011|2|36|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8082|Demon eyes, of a wild and ghastly vivacity, glared upon me in a thousand directions, where none had been visible before, and gleamed with the lurid lustre of a fire that I could not force my imagination to regard as unreal. 1052231|3|36|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8083|Unreal! 1052454|0|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8084|--Even while I breathed there came to my nostrils the breath of the vapour of heated iron! 1052461|1|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8085|most demoniac of men! 1052551|10|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8086|I shrank from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell. 1052572|11|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8087|Amid the thought of the fiery destruction that impended, the idea of the coolness of the well came over my soul like balm. 1052630|12|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8088|I rushed to its deadly brink. 1052752|13|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8089|I threw my straining vision below. 1052781|14|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8090|The glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses. 1052815|15|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8091|Yet, for a wild moment, did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what I saw. 1052879|16|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8092|At length it forced --it wrestled its way into my soul --it burned itself in upon my shuddering reason. 1052964|17|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8093|--Oh! 1053067|18|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8094|for a voice to speak! 1053072|19|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8095|A suffocating odour pervaded the prison! 1053093|2|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8096|--oh! 1053133|20|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8097|horror! 1053138|21|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8098|--oh! 1053145|22|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8099|any horror but this! 1053150|23|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8100|With a shriek, I rushed from the margin, and buried my face in my hands --weeping bitterly. 1053170|24|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8101|A deeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that glared at my agonies! 1053261|3|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8102|A richer tint of crimson diffused itself over the pictured horrors of blood. 1053333|4|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8103|I panted! 1053409|5|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8104|I gasped for breath! 1053418|6|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8105|There could be no doubt of the design of my tormentors --oh! 1053438|7|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8106|most unrelenting! 1053498|8|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8107|oh! 1053515|9|37|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8108|The heat rapidly increased, and once again I looked up, shuddering as with a fit of the ague. 1053518|0|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8109|There had been a second change in the cell --and now the change was obviously in the form. 1053611|1|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8110|I could have clasped the red walls to my bosom as a garment of eternal peace. 1053701|10|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8111|"""Death,"" I said, ""any death but that of the pit""! 1053778"|11|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8112|Fool! 1053827|12|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8113|might I have not known that into the pit it was the object of the burning iron to urge me? 1053832|13|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8114|Could I resist its glow? 1053922|14|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8115|or, if even that, could I withstand its pressure And now, flatter and flatter grew the lozenge, with a rapidity that left me no time for contemplation. 1053946|15|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8116|Its centre, and of course, its greatest width, came just over the yawning gulf. 1054097|16|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8117|I shrank back --but the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onward. 1054176|17|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8118|At length for my seared and writhing body there was no longer an inch of foothold on the firm floor of the prison. 1054245|18|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8119|I struggled no more, but the agony of my soul found vent in one loud, long, and final scream of despair. 1054359|19|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8120|As before, it was in vain that I, at first, endeavoured to appreciate or understand what was taking place. 1054463|2|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8121|But not long was I left in doubt. 1054569|3|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8122|The Inquisitorial vengeance had been hurried by my two-fold escape, and there was to be no more dallying with the King of Terrors. 1054602|4|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8123|The room had been square. 1054732|5|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8124|I saw that two of its iron angles were now acute --two, consequently, obtuse. 1054757|6|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8125|The fearful difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning sound. 1054834|7|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8126|In an instant the apartment had shifted its form into that of a lozenge. 1054912|8|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8127|But the alteration stopped not here-I neither hoped nor desired it to stop. 1054984|9|38|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8128|There was a discordant hum of human voices! 1055059|0|39|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8129|There was a loud blast as of many trumpets! 1055102|1|39|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8130|There was a harsh grating as of a thousand thunders! 1055145|2|39|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8131|The fiery walls rushed back! 1055197|3|39|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8132|An outstretched arm caught my own as I fell, fainting, into the abyss. 1055225|4|39|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8133|It was that of General Lasalle. 1055295|5|39|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8134|The French army had entered Toledo. 1055326|6|39|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8135|The Inquisition was in the hands of its enemies. 1055361|7|39|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8136|Amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember; amid earnest struggles to regather some token of the state of seeming nothingness into which my soul had lapsed, there have been moments when I have dreamed of success; there have been brief, very brief periods when I have conjured up remembrances which the lucid reason of a later epoch assures me could have had reference only to that condition of seeming unconsciousness. 1055409|0|4|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8137|These shadows of memory tell, indistinctly, of tall figures that lifted and bore me in silence down --down --still down --till a hideous dizziness oppressed me at the mere idea of the interminableness of the descent. 1055835|1|4|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8138|They tell also of a vague horror at my heart, on account of that heart's unnatural stillness. 1056051|2|4|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8139|Then comes a sense of sudden motionlessness throughout all things; as if those who bore me (a ghastly train! 1056144|3|4|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8140|) had outrun, in their descent, the limits of the limitless, and paused from the wearisomeness of their toil. 1056252|4|4|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8141|After this I call to mind flatness and dampness; and then all is madness --the madness of a memory which busies itself among forbidden things. 1056361|5|4|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8142|Very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound --the tumultuous motion of the heart, and, in my ears, the sound of its beating. 1056503|0|5|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8143|Then a pause in which all is blank. 1056641|1|5|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8144|Then again sound, and motion, and touch --a tingling sensation pervading my frame. 1056676|2|5|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8145|Then the mere consciousness of existence, without thought --a condition which lasted long. 1056758|3|5|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8146|Then, very suddenly, thought, and shuddering terror, and earnest endeavor to comprehend my true state. 1056848|4|5|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8147|Then a strong desire to lapse into insensibility. 1056950|5|5|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8148|Then a rushing revival of soul and a successful effort to move. 1056999|6|5|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8149|And now a full memory of the trial, of the judges, of the sable draperies, of the sentence, of the sickness, of the swoon. 1057062|7|5|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8150|Then entire forgetfulness of all that followed; of all that a later day and much earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to recall. 1057184|8|5|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8151|So far, I had not opened my eyes. 1057323|0|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8152|I felt that I lay upon my back, unbound. 1057356|1|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8153|I struggled for breath. 1057396|10|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8154|The intensity of the darkness seemed to oppress and stifle me. 1057419|11|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8155|The atmosphere was intolerably close. 1057481|12|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8156|I still lay quietly, and made effort to exercise my reason. 1057518|13|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8157|I brought to mind the inquisitorial proceedings, and attempted from that point to deduce my real condition. 1057577|14|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8158|The sentence had passed; and it appeared to me that a very long interval of time had since elapsed. 1057684|15|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8159|Yet not for a moment did I suppose myself actually dead. 1057783|16|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8160|Such a supposition, notwithstanding what we read in fiction, is altogether inconsistent with real existence; --but where and in what state was I? 1057839|17|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8161|The condemned to death, I knew, perished usually at the autos-da-fe, and one of these had been held on the very night of the day of my trial. 1057984|18|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8162|Had I been remanded to my dungeon, to await the next sacrifice, which would not take place for many months? 1058125|19|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8163|I reached out my hand, and it fell heavily upon something damp and hard. 1058232|2|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8164|This I at once saw could not be. 1058304|20|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8165|Victims had been in immediate demand. 1058336|21|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8166|Moreover, my dungeon, as well as all the condemned cells at Toledo, had stone floors, and light was not altogether excluded. 1058373|22|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8167|There I suffered it to remain for many minutes, while I strove to imagine where and what I could be. 1058497|3|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8168|I longed, yet dared not to employ my vision. 1058597|4|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8169|I dreaded the first glance at objects around me. 1058641|5|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8170|It was not that I feared to look upon things horrible, but that I grew aghast lest there should be nothing to see. 1058689|6|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8171|At length, with a wild desperation at heart, I quickly unclosed my eyes. 1058803|7|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8172|My worst thoughts, then, were confirmed. 1058875|8|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8173|The blackness of eternal night encompassed me. 1058915|9|6|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8174|A fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my heart, and for a brief period, I once more relapsed into insensibility. 1058961|0|7|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8175|Upon recovering, I at once started to my feet, trembling convulsively in every fibre. 1059096|1|7|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8176|I thrust my arms wildly above and around me in all directions. 1059181|2|7|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8177|I felt nothing; yet dreaded to move a step, lest I should be impeded by the walls of a tomb. 1059243|3|7|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8178|Perspiration burst from every pore, and stood in cold big beads upon my forehead. 1059335|4|7|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8179|The agony of suspense grew at length intolerable, and I cautiously moved forward, with my arms extended, and my eyes straining from their sockets, in the hope of catching some faint ray of light. 1059416|5|7|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8180|I proceeded for many paces; but still all was blackness and vacancy. 1059611|6|7|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8181|I breathed more freely. 1059679|7|7|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8182|It seemed evident that mine was not, at least, the most hideous of fates. 1059702|8|7|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8183|And now, as I still continued to step cautiously onward, there came thronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of the horrors of Toledo. 1059775|0|8|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8184|Of the dungeons there had been strange things narrated --fables I had always deemed them --but yet strange, and too ghastly to repeat, save in a whisper. 1059923|1|8|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8185|Was I left to perish of starvation in this subterranean world of darkness; or what fate, perhaps even more fearful, awaited me? 1060076|2|8|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8186|That the result would be death, and a death of more than customary bitterness, I knew too well the character of my judges to doubt. 1060203|3|8|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8187|The mode and the hour were all that occupied or distracted me. 1060334|4|8|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8188|My outstretched hands at length encountered some solid obstruction. 1060396|0|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8189|It was a wall, seemingly of stone masonry --very smooth, slimy, and cold. 1060463|1|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8190|The ground was moist and slippery. 1060536|10|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8191|I staggered onward for some time, when I stumbled and fell. 1060570|11|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8192|My excessive fatigue induced me to remain prostrate; and sleep soon overtook me as I lay. 1060629|12|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8193|I followed it up; stepping with all the careful distrust with which certain antique narratives had inspired me. 1060718|2|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8194|This process, however, afforded me no means of ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon; as I might make its circuit, and return to the point whence I set out, without being aware of the fact; so perfectly uniform seemed the wall. 1060829|3|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8195|I therefore sought the knife which had been in my pocket, when led into the inquisitorial chamber; but it was gone; my clothes had been exchanged for a wrapper of coarse serge. 1061060|4|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8196|I had thought of forcing the blade in some minute crevice of the masonry, so as to identify my point of departure. 1061236|5|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8197|The difficulty, nevertheless, was but trivial; although, in the disorder of my fancy, it seemed at first insuperable. 1061350|6|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8198|I tore a part of the hem from the robe and placed the fragment at full length, and at right angles to the wall. 1061467|7|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8199|In groping my way around the prison, I could not fail to encounter this rag upon completing the circuit. 1061578|8|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8200|So, at least I thought: but I had not counted upon the extent of the dungeon, or upon my own weakness. 1061682|9|9|The Pit And The Pendulum|1842-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8201|THE CHATEAU into which my valet had ventured to make forcible entrance, rather than permit me, in my desperately wounded condition, to pass a night in the open air, was one of those piles of commingled gloom and grandeur which have so long frowned among the Appennines, not less in fact than in the fancy of Mrs. Radcliffe. 1061784|0|0|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8202|To all appearance it had been temporarily and very lately abandoned. 1062107|1|0|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8203|We established ourselves in one of the smallest and least sumptuously furnished apartments. 1062175|2|0|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8204|It lay in a remote turret of the building. 1062266|3|0|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8205|Its decorations were rich, yet tattered and antique. 1062308|4|0|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8206|Its walls were hung with tapestry and bedecked with manifold and multiform armorial trophies, together with an unusually great number of very spirited modern paintings in frames of rich golden arabesque. 1062360|5|0|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8207|In these paintings, which depended from the walls not only in their main surfaces, but in very many nooks which the bizarre architecture of the chateau rendered necessary–in these paintings my incipient delirium, perhaps, had caused me to take deep interest; so that I bade Pedro to close the heavy shutters of the room–since it was already night–to light the tongues of a tall candelabrum which stood by the head of my bed–and to throw open far and wide the fringed curtains of black velvet which enveloped the bed itself. 1062563|6|0|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8208|I wished all this done that I might resign myself, if not to sleep, at least alternately to the contemplation of these pictures, and the perusal of a small volume which had been found upon the pillow, and which purported to criticise and describe them. 1063086|7|0|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8209|Long–long I read–and devoutly, devotedly I gazed. 1063338|0|1|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8210|Rapidly and gloriously the hours flew by and the deep midnight came. 1063387|1|1|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8211|The position of the candelabrum displeased me, and outreaching my hand with difficulty, rather than disturb my slumbering valet, I placed it so as to throw its rays more fully upon the book. 1063455|2|1|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8212|But the action produced an effect altogether unanticipated. 1063645|0|2|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8213|The rays of the numerous candles (for there were many) now fell within a niche of the room which had hitherto been thrown into deep shade by one of the bed-posts. 1063704|1|2|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8214|I thus saw in vivid light a picture all unnoticed before. 1063866|2|2|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8215|It was the portrait of a young girl just ripening into womanhood. 1063923|3|2|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8216|I glanced at the painting hurriedly, and then closed my eyes. 1063988|4|2|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8217|Why I did this was not at first apparent even to my own perception. 1064049|5|2|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8218|But while my lids remained thus shut, I ran over in my mind my reason for so shutting them. 1064116|6|2|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8219|It was an impulsive movement to gain time for thought–to make sure that my vision had not deceived me–to calm and subdue my fancy for a more sober and more certain gaze. 1064207|7|2|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8220|In a very few moments I again looked fixedly at the painting. 1064376|8|2|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8221|That I now saw aright I could not and would not doubt; for the first flashing of the candles upon that canvas had seemed to dissipate the dreamy stupor which was stealing over my senses, and to startle me at once into waking life. 1064437|0|3|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8222|The portrait, I have already said, was that of a young girl. 1064667|0|4|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8223|It was a mere head and shoulders, done in what is technically termed a vignette manner; much in the style of the favorite heads of Sully. 1064727|1|4|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8224|I had found the spell of the picture in an absolute life-likeliness of expression, which, at first startling, finally confounded, subdued, and appalled me. 1064864|10|4|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8225|With deep and reverent awe I replaced the candelabrum in its former position. 1065019|11|4|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8226|The cause of my deep agitation being thus shut from view, I sought eagerly the volume which discussed the paintings and their histories. 1065096|12|4|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8227|The arms, the bosom, and even the ends of the radiant hair melted imperceptibly into the vague yet deep shadow which formed the back-ground of the whole. 1065232|2|4|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8228|The frame was oval, richly gilded and filigreed in Moresque. 1065385|3|4|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8229|As a thing of art nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself. 1065445|4|4|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8230|But it could have been neither the execution of the work, nor the immortal beauty of the countenance, which had so suddenly and so vehemently moved me. 1065520|5|4|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8231|Least of all, could it have been that my fancy, shaken from its half slumber, had mistaken the head for that of a living person. 1065671|6|4|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8232|I saw at once that the peculiarities of the design, of the vignetting, and of the frame, must have instantly dispelled such idea–must have prevented even its momentary entertainment. 1065799|7|4|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8233|Thinking earnestly upon these points, I remained, for an hour perhaps, half sitting, half reclining, with my vision riveted upon the portrait. 1065981|8|4|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8234|At length, satisfied with the true secret of its effect, I fell back within the bed. 1066123|9|4|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8235|"""She was a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee. 1066207"|0|5|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8236|And evil was the hour when she saw, and loved, and wedded the painter. 1066281|1|5|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8237|And he would not see that the tints which he spread upon the canvas were drawn from the cheeks of her who sate beside him. 1066351|10|5|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8238|And when many weeks bad passed, and but little remained to do, save one brush upon the mouth and one tint upon the eye, the spirit of the lady again flickered up as the flame within the socket of the lamp. 1066473|11|5|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8239|And then the brush was given, and then the tint was placed; and, for one moment, the painter stood entranced before the work which he had wrought; but in the next, while he yet gazed, he grew tremulous and very pallid, and aghast, and crying with a loud voice, 'This is indeed Life itself! 1066678|12|5|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8240|' turned suddenly to regard his beloved:–She was dead! 1066967|13|5|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8241|He, passionate, studious, austere, and having already a bride in his Art; she a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee; all light and smiles, and frolicsome as the young fawn; loving and cherishing all things; hating only the Art which was her rival; dreading only the pallet and brushes and other untoward instruments which deprived her of the countenance of her lover. 1067021|2|5|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8242|It was thus a terrible thing for this lady to hear the painter speak of his desire to pourtray even his young bride. 1067415|3|5|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8243|But she was humble and obedient, and sat meekly for many weeks in the dark, high turret-chamber where the light dripped upon the pale canvas only from overhead. 1067531|4|5|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8244|But he, the painter, took glory in his work, which went on from hour to hour, and from day to day. 1067691|5|5|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8245|And be was a passionate, and wild, and moody man, who became lost in reveries; so that he would not see that the light which fell so ghastly in that lone turret withered the health and the spirits of his bride, who pined visibly to all but him. 1067789|6|5|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8246|Yet she smiled on and still on, uncomplainingly, because she saw that the painter (who had high renown) took a fervid and burning pleasure in his task, and wrought day and night to depict her who so loved him, yet who grew daily more dispirited and weak. 1068033|7|5|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8247|And in sooth some who beheld the portrait spoke of its resemblance in low words, as of a mighty marvel, and a proof not less of the power of the painter than of his deep love for her whom he depicted so surpassingly well. 1068287|8|5|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8248|But at length, as the labor drew nearer to its conclusion, there were admitted none into the turret; for the painter had grown wild with the ardor of his work, and turned his eyes from canvas merely, even to regard the countenance of his wife. 1068508|9|5|The Oval Portrait|1842-04-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8249|"THE ""Red Death"" had long devastated the country. 1068751"|0|0|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8250|No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. 1068799|1|0|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

8252|There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. 1068923|3|0|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8253|The scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men. 1069026|4|0|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8254|And the whole seizure, progress and termination of the disease, were the incidents of half an hour. 1069193|5|0|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8255|But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. 1069292|0|1|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8256|When his dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys. 1069354|1|1|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8257|In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to think. 1069591|10|1|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8258|The prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure. 1069643|11|1|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8259|There were buffoons, there were improvisatori, there were ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine. 1069698|12|1|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8260|All these and security were within. 1069827|13|1|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8261|"Without was the ""Red Death"". 1069862"|14|1|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8262|This was an extensive and magnificent structure, the creation of the prince's own eccentric yet august taste. 1069890|2|1|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8263|A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. 1069999|3|1|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8264|This wall had gates of iron. 1070037|4|1|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8265|The courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts. 1070065|5|1|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8266|They resolved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within. 1070152|6|1|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8267|The abbey was amply provisioned. 1070269|7|1|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8268|With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion. 1070301|8|1|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8269|The external world could take care of itself. 1070369|9|1|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

8272|"Seize him and unmask him --that we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise, from the battlements""! 1070536"|2|10|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8273|It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince Prospero as he uttered these words. 1070635|0|11|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8274|They rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly --for the prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand. 1070734|1|11|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8275|It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of pale courtiers by his side. 1070892|0|12|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8276|At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who at the moment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step, made closer approach to the speaker. 1070983|1|12|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8277|But from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party, there were found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince's person; and, while the vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first, through the blue chamber to the purple --through the purple to the green --through the green to the orange --through this again to the white --and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him. 1071210|2|12|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8278|It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero, maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six chambers, while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all. 1071890|3|12|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8279|He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer. 1072126|4|12|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8280|There was a sharp cry --and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in death the Prince Prospero. 1072368|5|12|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8281|Then, summoning the wild courage of despair, a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave-cerements and corpse-like mask which they handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form. 1072525|6|12|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8282|And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death. 1072915|0|13|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8283|He had come like a thief in the night. 1072970|1|13|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8284|And one by one dropped the revellers in the blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing posture of his fall. 1073008|2|13|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8285|And the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay. 1073140|3|13|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8286|And the flames of the tripods expired. 1073214|4|13|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8287|And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all. 1073252|5|13|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8288|It was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion, and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince Prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence. 1073328|0|2|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8289|It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. 1073560|0|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8290|But first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held. 1073603|1|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8291|The second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were purple. 1073659|10|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8292|The third was green throughout, and so were the casements. 1073753|11|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8293|The fourth was furnished and lighted with orange --the fifth with white --the sixth with violet. 1073811|12|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8294|The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue. 1073907|13|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8295|But in this chamber only, the color of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations. 1074094|14|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8296|The panes here were scarlet --a deep blood color. 1074187|15|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8297|Now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof. 1074236|16|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8298|There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers. 1074404|17|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8299|But in the corridors that followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier of fire that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room. 1074494|18|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8300|And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances. 1074705|19|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8301|There were seven --an imperial suite. 1074775|2|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8302|But in the western or black chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered, that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all. 1074812|20|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8303|In many palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded. 1075133|3|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8304|Here the case was very different; as might have been expected from the duke's love of the bizarre. 1075331|4|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8305|The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time. 1075429|5|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8306|There was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect. 1075533|6|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8307|To the right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite. 1075621|7|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8308|These windows were of stained glass whose color varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened. 1075778|8|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8309|That at the eastern extremity was hung, for example, in blue --and vividly blue were its windows. 1075926|9|3|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8310|It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western wall, a gigantic clock of ebony. 1076023|0|4|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8311|Its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause, momentarily, in their performance, to hearken to the sound; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the chimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew pale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused reverie or meditation. 1076124|1|4|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8312|But when the echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes, (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies,) there came yet another chiming of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before. 1076892|2|4|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8313|But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel. 1077434|0|5|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8314|The tastes of the duke were peculiar. 1077500|1|5|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8315|He had a fine eye for colors and effects. 1077537|2|5|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8316|He disregarded the decora of mere fashion. 1077578|3|5|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8317|His plans were bold and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre. 1077620|4|5|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8318|There are some who would have thought him mad. 1077699|5|5|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8319|His followers felt that he was not. 1077745|6|5|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8320|It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was not. 1077780|7|5|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8321|He had directed, in great part, the moveable embellishments of the seven chambers, upon occasion of this great fete; and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders. 1077854|0|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8322|Be sure they were grotesque. 1078050|1|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8323|The dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand. 1078078|10|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8324|But the echoes of the chime die away --they have endured but an instant --and a light, half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart. 1078120|11|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8325|And now again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many-tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods. 1078262|12|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8326|But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are now none of the maskers who venture; for the night is waning away; and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-colored panes; and the blackness of the sable drapery appals; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet, there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulge in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments. 1078448|13|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8327|"There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasm --much of what has been since seen in ""Hernani"". 1078925"|2|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8328|There were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments. 1079033|3|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8329|There were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions. 1079099|4|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8330|There was much of the beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust. 1079156|5|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8331|To and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of dreams. 1079315|6|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8332|And these --the dreams --writhed in and about, taking hue from the rooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps. 1079394|7|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8333|And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet. 1079547|8|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8334|And then, for a moment, all is still, and all is silent save the voice of the clock. 1079627|9|6|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8335|But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat feverishly the heart of life. 1079711|0|7|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8336|And the revel went whirlingly on, until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock. 1079806|1|7|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8337|And then the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before. 1079912|2|7|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8338|But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with more of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled. 1080062|3|7|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8339|And thus, too, it happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before. 1080278|4|7|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8340|And the rumor of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at length from the whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of disapprobation and surprise --then, finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust. 1080570|5|7|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8341|In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation. 1080807|0|8|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8342|In truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited; but the figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the bounds of even the prince's indefinite decorum. 1080945|1|8|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8343|There are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion. 1081129|2|8|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8344|Even with the utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are matters of which no jest can be made. 1081221|3|8|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8345|The whole company, indeed, seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed. 1081338|4|8|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8346|The figure was tall and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave. 1081473|5|8|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8347|The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat. 1081567|6|8|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8348|And yet all this might have been endured, if not approved, by the mad revellers around. 1081746|7|8|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8349|But the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death. 1081833|8|8|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8350|His vesture was dabbled in blood --and his broad brow, with all the features of the face, was besprinkled with the scarlet horror. 1081903|9|8|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8351|When the eyes of Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (which with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its role, stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste; but, in the next, his brow reddened with rage. 1082033|0|9|The Masque Of The Red Death|1842-05-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
8352|The garden like a lady fair was cut That lay as if she slumbered in delight, And to the open skies her eyes did shut; The azure fields of heaven were 'sembled right In a large round set with flow'rs of light: The flowers de luce and the round sparks of dew That hung upon their azure leaves, did show Like twinkling stars that sparkle in the ev'ning blue. 1082360|0|0|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8353|NO MORE remarkable man ever lived than my friend, the young Ellison. 1082715|0|1|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8354|He was remarkable in the entire and continuous profusion of good gifts ever lavished upon him by fortune. 1082783|1|1|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8355|From his cradle to his grave, a gale of the blandest prosperity bore him along. 1082888|2|1|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8356|Nor do I use the word Prosperity in its mere wordly or external sense. 1082967|3|1|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8357|I mean it as synonymous with happiness. 1083037|4|1|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8358|The person of whom I speak, seemed born for the purpose of foreshadowing the wild doctrines of Turgot, Price, Priestley, and Condorcet–of exemplifying, by individual instance, what has been deemed the mere chimera of the perfectionists. 1083076|5|1|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8359|In the brief existence of Ellison, I fancy, that I have seen refuted the dogma–that in man's physical and spiritual nature, lies some hidden principle, the antagonist of Bliss. 1083312|6|1|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8360|An intimate and anxious examination of his career, has taught me to understand that, in general, from the violation of a few simple laws of Humanity, arises the Wretchedness of mankind; that, as a species, we have in our possession the as yet unwrought elements of Content,–and that even now, in the present blindness and darkness of all idea on the great question of the Social Condition, it is not impossible that Man, the individual, under certain unusual and highly fortuitous conditions, may be happy. 1083488|7|1|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8361|Than all the nonsense of their stone ideal. 1083994|0|10|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8362|In landscape alone is the principle of the critic true; and, having felt its truth here, it is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has induced him to pronounce it true throughout all the domains of Art. 1084037|0|11|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8363|Having, I say, felt its truth here. 1084251|1|11|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8364|For the feeling is no affectation or chimera. 1084286|2|11|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8365|The mathematics afford no more absolute demonstrations, than the sentiment of his Art yields to the artist. 1084331|3|11|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8366|He not only believes, but positively knows, that such and such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter, or form, constitute, and alone constitute, the true Beauty. 1084438|4|11|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8367|Yet his reasons have not yet been matured into expression. 1084605|5|11|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8368|It remains for a more profound analysis than the world has yet seen, fully to investigate and express them. 1084663|6|11|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8369|Nevertheless is he confirmed in his instinctive opinions, by the concurrence of all his compeers. 1084770|7|11|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8370|Let a composition be defective, let an emendation be wrought in its mere arrangement of form; let this emendation be submitted to every artist in the world; by each will its necessity be admitted. 1084867|8|11|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8371|And even far more than this, in remedy of the defective composition, each insulated member of the fraternity will suggest the identical emendation. 1085063|9|11|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8372|"I repeat that in landscape arrangements, or collocations alone, is the physical Nature susceptible of ""exaltation"" and that, therefore, her susceptibility of improvement at this one point, was a mystery which, hitherto I had been unable to solve. 1085210"|0|12|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8373|It was Mr. Ellison who first suggested the idea that what we regarded as improvement or exaltation of the natural beauty, was really such, as respected only the mortal or human point of view; that each alteration or disturbance of the primitive scenery might possibly effect a blemish in the picture, if we could suppose this picture viewed at large from some remote point in the heavens. 1085456|1|12|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8374|"""It is easily understood,"" says Mr. Ellison, ""that what might improve a closely scrutinized detail, might, at the same time, injure a general and more distantly–observed effect"". 1085844"|2|12|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8375|He spoke upon this topic with warmth: regarding not so much its immediate or obvious importance, (which is little,) as the character of the conclusions to which it might lead, or of the collateral propositions which it might serve to corroborate or sustain. 1086022|3|12|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8376|There might be a class of beings, human once, but now to humanity invisible, for whose scrutiny and for whose refined appreciation of the beautiful, more especially than for our own, had been set in order by God the great landscape-garden of the whole earth. 1086279|4|12|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8377|In the course of our discussion, my young friend took occasion to quote some passages from a writer who has been supposed to have well treated this theme. 1086537|0|13|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8378|"""There are, properly,"" he writes, ""but two styles of landscape-gardening, the natural and the artificial. 1086691"|0|14|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8379|One seeks to recall the original beauty of the country, by adapting its means to the surrounding scenery; cultivating trees in harmony with the hills or plain of the neighboring land; detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size, proportion and color which, hid from the common observer, are revealed everywhere to the experienced student of nature. 1086796|1|14|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8380|The result of the natural style of gardening, is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities–in the prevalence of a beautiful harmony and order, than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles. 1087166|2|14|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8381|The artificial style has as many varieties as there are different tastes to gratify. 1087383|3|14|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8382|It has a certain general relation to the various styles of building. 1087467|4|14|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8383|There are the stately avenues and retirements of Versailles; Italian terraces; and a various mixed old English style, which bears some relation to the domestic Gothic or English Elizabethan architecture. 1087535|5|14|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8384|Whatever may be said against the abuses of the artificial landscape-gardening, a mixture of pure art in a garden scene, adds to it a great beauty. 1087738|6|14|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8385|This is partly pleasing to the eye, by the show of order and design, and partly moral. 1087884|7|14|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8386|A terrace, with an old moss-covered balustrade, calls up at once to the eye, the fair forms that have passed there in other days. 1087970|8|14|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8387|"The slightest exhibition of art is an evidence of care and human interest"". 1088099"|9|14|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8388|"""From what I have already observed,"" said Mr. Ellison, ""you will understand that I reject the idea, here expressed, of 'recalling the original beauty of the country. 1088174"|0|15|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8389|' The original beauty is never so great as that which may be introduced. 1088339|1|15|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8390|But, the thing done, the wonder accomplished, and the capacity for apprehension becomes universal. 1088411|10|15|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8391|The sophists of the negative school, who, through inability to create, have scoffed at creation, are now found the loudest in applause. 1088509|11|15|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8392|What, in its chrysalis condition of principle, affronted their demure reason, never fails, in its maturity of accomplishment, to extort admiration from their instinct of the beautiful or of the sublime. 1088644|12|15|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8393|Of course, much depends upon the selection of a spot with capabilities. 1088846|2|15|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8394|What is said in respect to the 'detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size, proportion and color,' is a mere vagueness of speech, which may mean much, or little, or nothing, and which guides in no degree. 1088917|3|15|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8395|That the true 'result of the natural style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities, than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles,' is a proposition better suited to the grovelling apprehension of the herd, than to the fervid dreams of the man of genius. 1089144|4|15|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8396|The merit suggested is, at best, negative, and appertains to that hobbling criticism which, in letters, would elevate Addison into apotheosis. 1089444|5|15|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8397|In truth, while that merit which consists in the mere avoiding demerit, appeals directly to the understanding, and can thus be foreshadowed in Rule, the loftier merit, which breathes and flames in invention or creation, can be apprehended solely in its results. 1089586|6|15|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8398|Rule applies but to the excellences of avoidance–to the virtues which deny or refrain. 1089847|7|15|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8399|Beyond these the critical art can but suggest. 1089933|8|15|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8400|We may be instructed to build an Odyssey, but it is in vain that we are told how to conceive a 'Tempest,' an 'Inferno,' a 'Prometheus Bound,' a 'Nightingale,' such as that of Keats, or the 'Sensitive Plant' of Shelley. 1089979|9|15|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8401|"""Our author's observations on the artificial style of gardening,"" continued Mr. Ellison, ""are less objectionable. 1090197"|0|16|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']

8404|I repeat that the principle here expressed, is incontrovertible; but there may be something even beyond it. 1090457|3|16|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8405|There may be an object in full keeping with the principle suggested–an object unattainable by the means ordinarily in possession of mankind, yet which, if attained, would lend a charm to the landscape-garden immeasurably surpassing that which a merely human interest could bestow. 1090564|4|16|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8406|The true poet possessed of very unusual pecuniary resources, might possibly, while retaining the necessary idea of art or interest or culture, so imbue his designs at once with extent and novelty of Beauty, as to convey the sentiment of spiritual interference. 1090844|5|16|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8407|It will be seen that, in bringing about such result, he secures all the advantages of interest or design, while relieving his work of all the harshness and technicality of Art. 1091104|6|16|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8408|In the most rugged of wildernesses–in the most savage of the scenes of pure Nature–there is apparent the art of a Creator; yet is this art apparent only to reflection; in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling. 1091280|7|16|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8409|"Now, if we imagine this sense of the Almighty Design to be harmonized in a measurable degree, if we suppose a landscape whose combined strangeness, vastness, definitiveness, and magnificence, shall inspire the idea of culture, or care, or superintendence, on the part of intelligences superior yet akin to humanity–then the sentiment of interest is preserved, while the Art is made to assume the air of an intermediate or secondary Nature–a Nature which is not God, nor an emanation of God, but which still is Nature, in the sense that it is the handiwork of the angels that hover between man and God"". 1091500"|8|16|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8410|It was in devoting his gigantic wealth to the practical embodiment of a vision such as this–in the free exercise in the open air, which resulted from personal direction of his plans–in the continuous and unceasing object which these plans afford–in the contempt of ambition which it enabled him more to feel than to affect–and, lastly, it was in the companionship and sympathy of a devoted wife, that Ellison thought to find, and found, an exemption from the ordinary cares of Humanity, with a far greater amount of positive happiness than ever glowed in the rapt day-dreams of De Stael. 1092102|0|17|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8411|With opinions such as these was my young friend fully imbued; and thus is it especially worthy of observation that the uninterrupted enjoyment which distinguished his life was in great part the result of preconcert. 1092689|0|2|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8412|It is, indeed evident, that with less of the instinctive philosophy which, now and then, stands so well in the stead of experience, Mr. Ellison would have found himself precipitated, by the very extraordinary successes of his life, into the common vortex of Unhappiness which yawns for those of preeminent endowments. 1092904|1|2|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8413|His third was the contempt of ambition. 1093221|10|2|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8414|His fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit; and he held that, other things being equal, the extent of happiness was proportioned to the spirituality of this object. 1093260|11|2|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8415|But it is by no means my present object to pen an essay on Happiness. 1093427|2|2|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8416|The ideas of my friend may be summed up in a few words. 1093496|3|2|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8417|He admitted but four unvarying laws, or rather elementary principles, of Bliss. 1093551|4|2|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8418|That which he considered chief, was (strange to say! 1093630|5|2|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8419|) the simple and purely physical one of free exercise in the open air. 1093682|6|2|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8420|"""The health,"" he said, ""attainable by other means than this is scarcely worth the name"". 1093752"|7|2|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8421|He pointed to the tillers of the earth–the only people who, as a class, are proverbially more happy than others–and then he instanced the high ecstasies of the fox-hunter. 1093840|8|2|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8422|His second principle was the love of woman. 1094011|9|2|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8423|I have said that Ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts lavished upon him by Fortune. 1094054|0|3|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8424|In personal grace and beauty he exceeded all men. 1094165|1|3|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8425|This act did not prevent young Ellison, upon his twenty-first birth-day, from entering into possession, as the heir of his ancestor, Seabright, of a fortune of four hundred and fifty millions of dollars. 1094214|10|3|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8426|His intellect was of that order to which the attainment of knowledge is less a labor than a necessity and an intuition. 1094417|2|3|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8427|His family was one of the most illustrious of the empire. 1094536|3|3|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8428|His bride was the loveliest and most devoted of women. 1094593|4|3|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8429|His possessions had been always ample; but, upon the attainment of his one and twentieth year, it was discovered that one of those extraordinary freaks of Fate had been played in his behalf which startle the whole social world amid which they occur, and seldom fail radically to alter the entire moral constitution of those who are their objects. 1094647|5|3|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8430|It appears that about one hundred years prior to Mr. Ellison's attainment of his majority, there had died, in a remote province, one Mr. Seabright Ellison. 1094993|6|3|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8431|This gentlemen had amassed a princely fortune, and, having no very immediate connexions, conceived the whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate for a century after his decease. 1095148|7|3|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8432|Minutely and sagaciously directing the various modes of investment, he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the nearest of blood, bearing the name Ellison, who should be alive at the end of the hundred years. 1095326|8|3|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8433|Many futile attempts had been made to set aside this singular bequest; their ex post facto character rendered them abortive; but the attention of a jealous government was aroused, and a decree finally obtained, forbidding all similar accumulations. 1095532|9|3|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8434|* An incident similar in outline to the one here imagined, occurred, not very long ago, in England. 1095780|0|4|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8435|The name of the fortunate heir (who still lives,) is Thelluson. 1095879|1|4|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8436|"I first saw an account of this matter in the ""Tour"" of Prince Puckler Muskau. 1095942"|2|4|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8437|"He makes the sum received ninety millions of pounds, and observes, with much force, that, ""in the contemplation of so vast a sum, and of the services, to which it might be applied, there is something even of the sublime"". 1096019"|3|4|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8438|To suit the views of this article, I have followed the Prince's statement–a grossly exaggerated one, no doubt. 1096240|4|4|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8439|When it had become definitely known that such was the enormous wealth inherited, there were, of course, many speculations as to the mode of its disposal. 1096350|0|5|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8440|The gigantic magnitude and the immediately available nature of the sum, dazzled and bewildered all who thought upon the topic. 1096503|1|5|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8441|The possessor of any appreciable amount of money might have been imagined to perform any one of a thousand things. 1096629|2|5|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8442|With riches merely surpassing those of any citizen, it would have been easy to suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionable extravagances of his time; or busying himself with political intrigues; or aiming at ministerial power, or purchasing increase of nobility, or devising gorgeous architectural piles; or collecting large specimens of Virtu; or playing the munificent patron of Letters and Art; or endowing and bestowing his name upon extensive institutions of charity. 1096743|3|5|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8443|But, for the inconceivable wealth in the actual possession of the young heir, these objects and all ordinary objects were felt to be inadequate. 1097229|4|5|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8444|Recourse was had to figures; and figures but sufficed to confound. 1097373|5|5|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8445|It was seen, that even at three per cent, the annual income of the inheritance amounted to no less than thirteen millions and five hundred thousand dollars; which was one million and one hundred and twenty-five thousand per month; or thirty-six thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six per day, or one thousand five hundred and forty-one per hour, or six and twenty dollars for every minute that flew. 1097439|6|5|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8446|Thus the usual track of supposition was thoroughly broken up. 1097837|7|5|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8447|Men knew not what to imagine. 1097898|8|5|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8448|There were some who even conceived that Mr. Ellison would divest himself forthwith of at least two-thirds of his fortune as of utterly superfluous opulence; enriching whole troops of his relatives by division of his superabundance. 1097927|9|5|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8449|I was not surprised, however, to perceive that he had long made up his mind upon a topic which had occasioned so much of discussion to his friends. 1098158|0|6|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8450|Nor was I greatly astonished at the nature of his decision. 1098305|1|6|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8451|I believe the world has never yet seen, and that, unless through some series of accidents goading the noblest order of mind into distasteful exertion, the world will never behold, that full extent of triumphant execution, in the richer productions of Art, of which the human nature is absolutely capable. 1098364|10|6|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8452|In the widest and noblest sense, he was a poet. 1098668|2|6|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8453|He comprehended, moreover, the true character, the august aims, the supreme majesty and dignity of the poetic sentiment. 1098715|3|6|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8454|The proper gratification of the sentiment he instinctively felt to lie in the creation of novel forms of Beauty. 1098835|4|6|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8455|Some peculiarities, either in his early education, or in the nature of his intellect, had tinged with what is termed materialism the whole cast of his ethical speculations; and it was this bias, perhaps, which imperceptibly led him to perceive that the most advantageous, if not the sole legitimate field for the exercise of the poetic sentiment, was to be found in the creation of novel moods of purely physical loveliness. 1098947|5|6|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8456|Thus it happened that he became neither musician nor poet; if we use this latter term in its every–day acceptation. 1099371|6|6|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8457|Or it might have been that he became neither the one nor the other, in pursuance of an idea of his which I have already mentioned–the idea, that in the contempt of ambition lay one of the essential principles of happiness on earth. 1099486|7|6|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8458|Is it not, indeed, possible that while a high order of genius is necessarily ambitious, the highest is invariably above that which is termed ambition? 1099717|8|6|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8459|"And may it not thus happen that many far greater than Milton, have contentedly remained ""mute and inglorious""? 1099867"|9|6|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8460|Mr. Ellison became neither musician nor poet; although no man lived more profoundly enamored both of Music and the Muse. 1099977|0|7|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8461|Under other circumstances than those which invested him, it is not impossible that he would have become a painter. 1100097|1|7|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8462|The field of sculpture, although in its nature rigidly poetical, was too limited in its extent and in its consequences, to have occupied, at any time, much of his attention. 1100211|2|7|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8463|And I have now mentioned all the provinces in which even the most liberal understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared this sentiment capable of expatiating. 1100384|3|7|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8464|"I mean the most liberal public or recognized conception of the idea involved in the phrase ""poetic sentiment"". 1100547"|4|7|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8465|But Mr. Ellison imagined that the richest, and altogether the most natural and most suitable province, had been blindly neglected. 1100657|5|7|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8466|No definition had spoken of the Landscape-Gardener, as of the poet; yet my friend could not fail to perceive that the creation of the Landscape-Garden offered to the true muse the most magnificent of opportunities. 1100787|6|7|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8467|Here was, indeed, the fairest field for the display of invention, or imagination, in the endless combining of forms of novel Beauty; the elements which should enter into combination being, at all times, and by a vast superiority, the most glorious which the earth could afford. 1101001|7|7|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8468|In the multiform of the tree, and in the multicolor of the flower, he recognized the most direct and the most energetic efforts of Nature at physical loveliness. 1101278|8|7|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8469|And in the direction or concentration of this effort, or, still more properly, in its adaption to the eyes which were to behold it upon earth, he perceived that he should be employing the best means- laboring to the greatest advantage–in the fulfilment of his destiny as Poet. 1101439|9|7|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8470|"""Its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it upon earth"". 1101715"|0|8|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8471|In his explanation of this phraseology, Mr. Ellison did much towards solving what has always seemed to me an enigma. 1101779|1|8|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8472|Who shall presume to imitate the colors of the tulip, or to improve the proportions of the lily of the valley? 1101895|10|8|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8473|"The criticism which says, of sculpture or of portraiture, that ""Nature is to be exalted rather than imitated,"" is in error. 1102005"|11|8|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8474|No pictorial or sculptural combinations of points of human loveliness, do more than approach the living and breathing human beauty as it gladdens our daily path. 1102128|12|8|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8475|I mean the fact (which none but the ignorant dispute,) that no such combinations of scenery exist in Nature as the painter of genius has in his power to produce. 1102289|2|8|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8476|No such Paradises are to be found in reality as have glowed upon the canvass of Claude. 1102450|3|8|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8477|In the most enchanting of natural landscapes, there will always be found a defect or an excess–many excesses and defects. 1102537|4|8|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8478|While the component parts may exceed, individually, the highest skill of the artist, the arrangement of the parts will always be susceptible of improvement. 1102658|5|8|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8479|In short, no position can be attained, from which an artistical eye, looking steadily, will not find matter of offence, in what is technically termed the composition of a natural landscape. 1102814|6|8|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8480|And yet how unintelligible is this! 1103003|7|8|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']
8481|In all other matters we are justly instructed to regard Nature as supreme. 1103038|8|8|The Landscape Garden|1842-10-25 00:00:00|['Sketch']

8491|Is it wonderful that the one known atrocity should influence the popular judgment in regard to the other unknown? 1103738|10|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8492|This judgment awaited direction, and the known outrage seemed so opportunely to afford it! 1103851|11|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8494|The connection of the two events had about it so much of the palpable, that the true wonder would have been a failure of the populace to appreciate and to seize it. 1104035|13|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8495|But, in fact, the one atrocity, known to be so committed, is, if any thing, evidence that the other, committed at a time nearly coincident, was not so committed. 1104199|14|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8496|It would have been a miracle indeed, if, while a gang of ruffians were perpetrating, at a given locality, a most unheard–of wrong, there should have been another similar gang, in a similar locality, in the same city, under the same circumstances, with the same means and appliances, engaged in a wrong of precisely the same aspect, at precisely the same period of time! 1104360|15|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8497|Yet in what, if not in this marvellous train of coincidence, does the accidentally suggested opinion of the populace call upon us to believe? 1104729|16|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8498|When arising of itself–when manifesting itself in a strictly spontaneous manner–we should look upon it as analogous with that intuition which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius. 1104870|2|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8505|But it is now made known that, at the very period, or about the very period, in which it is supposed that the girl was assassinated, an outrage similar in nature to that endured by the deceased, although less in extent, was perpetrated by a gang of young ruffians, upon the person of a second young female. 1105680|9|100|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8506|"""Before proceeding farther, let us consider the supposed scene of the assassination, in the thicket at the Barriere du Roule. 1105986"|0|101|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8507|This thicket, although dense, was in the close vicinity of a public road. 1106111|1|101|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8508|Within were three or four large stones, forming a kind of seat with a back and a footstool. 1106184|2|101|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8509|On the upper stone was discovered a white petticoat; on the second, a silk scarf. 1106275|3|101|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8510|A parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief were also here found. 1106356|4|101|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8511|The handkerchief bore the name 'Marie Roget'. 1106422|5|101|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8512|Fragments of dress were seen on the branches around. 1106467|6|101|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8513|The earth was trampled, the bushes were broken, and there was every evidence of a violent struggle. 1106519|7|101|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8514|"""Notwithstanding the acclamation with which the discovery of this thicket was received by the press, and the unanimity with which it was supposed to indicate the precise scene of the outrage, it must be admitted that there was some very good reason for doubt. 1106618"|0|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8515|That it was the scene, I may or I may not believe–but there was excellent reason for doubt. 1106877|1|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8516|But the grass will grow, especially in warm and damp weather (such as was that of the period of the murder), as much as two or three inches in a single day. 1106968|10|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8517|A parasol lying upon a newly turfed ground, might, in a single week, be entirely concealed from sight by the upspringing grass. 1107124|11|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8518|And touching that mildew upon which the editor of Le Soleil so pertinaciously insists, that he employs the word no less than three times in the brief paragraph just quoted, is he really unaware of the nature of this mildew? 1107251|12|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8519|Is he to be told that it is one of the many classes of fungus, of which the most ordinary feature is its upspringing and decadence within twenty-four hours? 1107474|13|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8520|Had the true scene been, as Le Commerciel suggested, in the neighborhood of the Rue Pavee St. Andree, the perpetrators of the crime, supposing them still resident in Paris, would naturally have been stricken with terror at the public attention thus acutely directed into the proper channel; and, in certain classes of minds, there would have arisen, at once, a sense of the necessity of some exertion to re-divert this attention. 1107630|2|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8521|And thus, the thicket of the Barriere du Roule having been already suspected, the idea of placing the articles where they were found, might have been naturally entertained. 1108059|3|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8522|There is no real evidence, although Le Soleil so supposes, that the articles discovered had been more than a very few days in the thicket; while there is much circumstantial proof that they could not have remained there, without attracting attention, during the twenty days elapsing between the fatal Sunday and the afternoon upon which they were found by the boys. 1108231|4|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8523|'They were all mildewed down hard,' says Le Soleil, adopting the opinions of its predecessors, 'with the action of the rain and stuck together from mildew. 1108596|5|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8524|The grass had grown around and over some of them. 1108751|6|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8525|The silk of the parasol was strong, but the threads of it were run together within. 1108800|7|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8526|The upper part, where it had been doubled and folded, was all mildewed and rotten, and tore on being opened. 1108883|8|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8527|' In respect to the grass having 'grown around and over some of them,' it is obvious that the fact could only have been ascertained from the words, and thus from the recollections, of two small boys; for these boys removed the articles and took them home before they had been seen by a third party. 1108991|9|102|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8528|"""Thus we see, at a glance, that what has been most triumphantly adduced in support of the idea that the articles had been 'for at least three or four weeks' in the thicket, is most absurdly null as regards any evidence of that fact. 1109289"|0|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8529|On the other hand, it is exceedingly difficult to believe that these articles could have remained in the thicket specified for a longer period than a single week–for a longer period than from one Sunday to the next. 1109521|1|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8530|It is now especially that, released from the claims of labor, or deprived of the customary opportunities of crime, the town blackguard seeks the precincts of the town, not through love of the rural, which in his heart he despises, but by way of escape from the restraints and conventionalities of society. 1109736|10|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8531|He desires less the fresh air and the green trees, than the utter license of the country. 1110041|11|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8532|Here, at the road-side inn, or beneath the foliage of the woods, he indulges unchecked by any eye except those of his boon companions, in all the mad excess of a counterfeit hilarity- the joint offspring of liberty and of rum. 1110130|12|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8533|I say nothing more than what must be obvious to every dispassionate observer, when I repeat that the circumstance of the articles in question having remained undiscovered, for a longer period than from one Sunday to another, in any thicket in the immediate neighborhood of Paris, is to be looked upon as little less than miraculous. 1110356|13|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8534|Those who know any thing of the vicinity of Paris, know the extreme difficulty of finding seclusion, unless at a great distance from its suburbs. 1110688|2|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8535|Such a thing as an unexplored or even an unfrequently visited recess, amid its woods or groves, is not for a moment to be imagined. 1110833|3|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8536|Let any one who, being at heart a lover of nature, is yet chained by duty to the dust and heat of this great metropolis–let any such one attempt, even during the week-days, to slake his thirst for solitude amid the scenes of natural loveliness which immediately surround us. 1110964|4|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8537|At every second step, he will find the growing charm dispelled by the voice and personal intrusion of some ruffian or party of carousing blackguards. 1111238|5|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8538|He will seek privacy amid the densest foliage, all in vain. 1111387|6|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8539|Here are the very nooks where the unwashed most abound–here are the temples most desecrate. 1111446|7|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8540|With sickness of the heart the wanderer will flee back to the polluted Paris as to a less odious because less incongruous sink of pollution. 1111537|8|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8541|But if the vicinity of the city is so beset during the working days of the week, how much more so on the Sabbath! 1111677|9|103|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8542|"""But there are not wanting other grounds for the suspicion that the articles were placed in the thicket with the view of diverting attention from the real scene of the outrage. 1111790"|0|104|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8543|And first, let me direct your notice to the date of the discovery of the articles. 1111966|1|104|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8544|Collate this with the date of the fifth extract made by myself from the newspapers. 1112048|2|104|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8545|You will find that the discovery followed, almost immediately, the urgent communications sent to the evening paper. 1112131|3|104|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8546|These communications, although various, and apparently from various sources, tended all to the same point-viz. 1112246|4|104|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8547|, the directing of attention to a gang as the perpetrators of the outrage, and to the neighborhood of the Barriere du Roule as its scene. 1112356|5|104|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8548|Now, here, of course, the suspicion is not that, in consequence of these communications, or of the public attention by them directed, the articles were found by the boys; but the suspicion might and may well have been, that the articles were not before found by the boys, for the reason that the articles had not before been in the thicket; having been deposited there only at so late a period as at the date, or shortly prior to the date of the communications, by the guilty authors of these communications themselves. 1112493|6|104|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8549|"""This thicket was a singular–an exceedingly singular one. 1113012"|0|105|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8550|It was unusually dense. 1113069|1|105|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8551|Within its naturally walled enclosure were three extraordinary stones, forming a seat with a back and a footstool. 1113092|2|105|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8552|And this thicket, so full of art, was in the immediate vicinity, within a few rods, of the dwelling of Madame Deluc, whose boys were in the habit of closely examining the shrubberies about them in search of the bark of the sassafras. 1113206|3|105|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8553|Would it be a rash wager–a wager of one thousand to one–that a day never passed over the heads of these boys without finding at least one of them ensconced in the umbrageous hall, and enthroned upon its natural throne? 1113439|4|105|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8554|Those who would hesitate at such a wager, have either never been boys themselves, or have forgotten the boyish nature. 1113657|5|105|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8555|I repeat–it is exceedingly hard to comprehend how the articles could have remained in this thicket undiscovered, for a longer period than one or two days; and that thus there is good ground for suspicion, in spite of the dogmatic ignorance of Le Soleil, that they were, at a comparatively late date, deposited where found. 1113775|6|105|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8556|"""But there are still other and stronger reasons for believing them so deposited, than any which I have as yet urged. 1114097"|0|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8557|And, now, let me beg your notice to the highly artificial arrangement of the articles. 1114213|1|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8558|They looked like strips torn off. 1114299|10|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8559|' Here, inadvertently, Le Soleil has employed an exceedingly suspicious phrase. 1114332|11|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8560|The pieces, as described, do indeed look like strips torn off; but purposely and by hand. 1114411|12|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8561|It is one of the rarest of accidents that a piece is 'torn off,' from any garment such as is now in question, by the agency of a thorn. 1114500|13|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8562|From the very nature of such fabrics, a thorn or nail becoming tangled in them, tears them rectangularly–divides them into two longitudinal rents, at right angles with each other, and meeting at an apex where the thorn enters–but it is scarcely possible to conceive the piece 'torn off. 1114635|14|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8563|' I never so knew it, nor did you. 1114921|15|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8564|To tear a piece off from such fabric, two distinct forces, in different directions, will be, in almost every case, required. 1114955|16|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8565|If there be two edges to the fabric- if, for example, it be a pocket-handkerchief, and it is desired to tear from it a slip, then, and then only, will the one force serve the purpose. 1115079|17|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8566|But in the present case the question is of a dress, presenting but one edge. 1115262|18|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8567|To tear a piece from the interior, where no edge is presented, could only be effected by a miracle through the agency of thorns, and no one thorn could accomplish it. 1115338|19|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8568|On the upper stone lay a white petticoat; on the second, a silk scarf; scattered around, were a parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief bearing the name 'Marie Roget. 1115504|2|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8569|But, even where an edge is presented, two thorns will be necessary, operating, the one in two distinct directions, and the other in one. 1115673|20|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8570|And this in the supposition that the edge is unhemmed. 1115809|21|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8571|If hemmed, the matter is nearly out of the question. 1115863|22|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8572|We thus see the numerous and great obstacles in the way of pieces being 'torn off' through the simple agency of 'thorns'; yet we are required to believe not only that one piece but that many have been so torn. 1115915|23|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8573|'And one part,' too, 'was the hem of the frock'! 1116124|24|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8574|Another piece was 'part of the skirt, not the hem,'–that is to say, was torn completely out, through the agency of thorns, from the unedged interior of the dress! 1116172|25|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8575|These, I say, are things which one may well be pardoned for disbelieving; yet, taken collectedly, they form, perhaps, less of reasonable ground for suspicion, than the one startling circumstance of the articles having been left in this thicket at all, by any murderers who had enough precaution to think of removing the corpse. 1116334|26|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8576|You will not have apprehended me rightly, however, if you suppose it my design to deny this thicket as the scene of the outrage. 1116661|27|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8577|There might have been a wrong here, or more possibly, an accident at Madame Deluc's. 1116789|28|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8578|But, in fact, this is a point of minor importance. 1116873|29|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8579|' Here is just such an arrangement as would naturally be made by a not over-acute person wishing to dispose the articles naturally. 1116923|3|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8580|We are not engaged in an attempt to discover the scene, but to produce the perpetrators of the murder. 1117054|30|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8581|What I have adduced, notwithstanding the minuteness with which I have adduced it, has been with the view, first, to show the folly of the positive and headlong assertions of Le Soleil, but secondly and chiefly, to bring you, by the most natural route, to a further contemplation of the doubt whether this assassination has, or has not, been the work of a gang. 1117156|31|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8582|But it is by no means a really natural arrangement. 1117516|4|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8583|I should rather have looked to see the things all lying on the ground and trampled under foot. 1117567|5|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8584|In the narrow limits of that bower, it would have been scarcely possible that the petticoat and scarf should have retained a position upon the stones, when subjected to the brushing to and fro of many struggling persons. 1117661|6|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8585|'There was evidence,' it is said, 'of a struggle; and the earth was trampled, the bushes were broken,'–but the petticoat and the scarf are found deposited as if upon shelves. 1117881|7|106|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8598|Thus the affair died away, and was generally forgotten; for the girl, ostensibly to relieve herself from the impertinence of curiosity soon bade a final adieu to the perfumer, and sought the shelter of her mother's residence in the Rue Pavee Saint Andree. 1119574|7|12|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8599|It was about five months after this return home, that her friends were alarmed by her sudden disappearance for the second time. 1119829|0|13|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8601|On the fourth her corpse was found floating in the Seine* near the shore which is opposite the Quartier of the Rue Saint Andre, and at a point not very far distant from the secluded neighborhood of the Barriere du Roule. 1120005|2|13|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8602|The atrocity of this murder (for it was at once evident that murder had been committed), the youth and beauty of the victim, and, above all her previous notoriety, conspired to produce intense excitement in the minds of the sensitive Parisians. 1120225|0|16|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8603|I can call to mind no similar occurrence producing so general and so intense an effect. 1120469|1|16|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8604|For several weeks, in the discussion of this one absorbing theme, even the momentous political topics of the day were forgotten. 1120556|2|16|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8605|The Prefect made unusual exertions; and the powers of the whole Parisian police were, of course, tasked to the utmost extent. 1120684|3|16|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8606|Upon the first discovery of the corpse, it was not supposed that the murderer would be able to elude, for more than a very brief period, the inquisition which was immediately set on foot. 1120809|0|17|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8607|It was not until the expiration of a week that it was deemed necessary to offer a reward; and even then this reward was limited to a thousand francs. 1120996|1|17|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8608|In the meantime the investigation proceeded with vigor, if not always with judgment, and numerous individuals were examined to no purpose; while, owing to the continual absence of all clew to the mystery, the popular excitement greatly increased. 1121145|2|17|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8609|"At the end of the tenth day it was thought advisable to double the sum originally proposed; and, at length, the second week having elapsed without leading to any discoveries, and the prejudice which always exists in Paris against the Police having given vent to itself in several serious emeutes, the Prefect took it upon himself to offer the sum of twenty thousand francs ""for the conviction of the assassin,"" or, if more than one should prove to have been implicated, ""for the conviction of any one of the assassins"". 1121391"|3|17|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8610|In the proclamation setting forth this reward, a full pardon was promised to any accomplice who should come forward in evidence against his fellow; and to the whole was appended, wherever it appeared, the private placard of a committee of citizens, offering ten thousand francs, in addition to the amount proposed by the Prefecture. 1121910|4|17|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8611|The entire reward thus stood at no less than thirty thousand francs, which will be regarded as an extraordinary sum when we consider the humble condition of the girl, and the great frequency, in large cities, of such atrocities as the one described. 1122242|5|17|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8612|No one doubted now that the mystery of this murder would be immediately brought to light. 1122491|0|18|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8613|But although, in one or two instances, arrests were made which promised elucidation, yet nothing was elicited which could implicate the parties suspected; and they were discharged forthwith. 1122580|1|18|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8614|He concluded a somewhat droll speech with a compliment upon what he was pleased to term the tact of Dupin, and made him a direct and certainly a liberal proposition, the precise nature of which I do not feel myself at liberty to disclose, but which has no bearing upon the proper subject of my narrative. 1122770|10|18|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8615|Strange as it may appear, the third week from the discovery of the body had passed, and passed without any light being thrown upon the subject, before even a rumor of the events which had so agitated the public mind reached the ears of Dupin and myself. 1123074|2|18|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8616|Engaged in researches which had absorbed our whole attention, it had been nearly a month since either of us had gone abroad, or received a visitor, or more than glanced at the leading political articles in one of the daily papers. 1123327|3|18|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8617|The first intelligence of the murder was brought us by G--, in person. 1123557|4|18|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8618|He called upon us early in the afternoon of the thirteenth of July, 18-, and remained with us until late in the night. 1123627|5|18|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8619|He had been piqued by the failure of all his endeavors to ferret out the assassins. 1123745|6|18|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8620|His reputation–so he said with a peculiarly Parisian air–was at stake. 1123828|7|18|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8621|Even his honor was concerned. 1123898|8|18|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8622|The eyes of the public were upon him; and there was really no sacrifice which he would not be willing to make for the development of the mystery. 1123927|9|18|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8623|The compliment my friend rebutted as best he could, but the proposition he accepted at once, although its advantages were altogether provisional. 1124072|0|19|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8624|This point being settled, the Prefect broke forth at once into explanations of his own views, interspersing them with long comments upon the evidence; of which latter we were not yet in possession. 1124217|1|19|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8625|He discoursed much and, beyond doubt, learnedly; while I hazarded an occasional suggestion as the night wore drowsily away. 1124414|2|19|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8626|Dupin, sitting steadily in his accustomed armchair, was the embodiment of respectful attention. 1124537|3|19|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8627|He wore spectacles, during the whole interview; and an occasional glance beneath their green glasses sufficed to convince me that he slept not the less soundly, because silently, throughout the seven or eight leaden-footed hours which immediately preceded the departure of the Prefect. 1124632|4|19|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8628|"Upon the original publication of ""Marie Roget,"" the footnotes now appended were considered unnecessary; but the lapse of several years since the tragedy upon which the tale is based, renders it expedient to give them, and also to say a few words in explanation of the general design. 1124917"|0|2|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8629|A young girl, Mary Cecilia Rogers, was murdered in the vicinity of New York; and although her death occasioned an intense and long-enduring excitement, the mystery attending it had remained unsolved at the period when the present paper was written and published (November, 1842). 1125200|1|2|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8630|Herein, under pretence of relating the fate of a Parisian grisette, the author has followed, in minute detail, the essential, while merely paralleling the inessential, facts of the real murder of Mary Rogers. 1125479|2|2|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8631|Thus all argument founded upon the fiction is applicable to the truth: and the investigation of the truth was the object. 1125687|3|2|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8632|In the morning, I procured, at the Prefecture, a full report of all the evidence elicited, and, at the various newspaper offices, a copy of every paper in which, from first to last, had been published any decisive information in regard to this sad affair. 1125808|0|20|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8633|Marie Roget left the residence of her mother, in the Rue Pavee St. Andree, about nine o'clock in the morning of Sunday, June the twenty second, 18-. 1126063|0|21|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8634|In going out, she gave notice to a Monsieur Jacques St. Eustache,* and to him only, of her intention to spend the day with an aunt, who resided in the Rue des Dromes. 1126211|1|21|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8635|The Rue des Dromes is a short and narrow but populous thoroughfare, not far from the banks of the river, and at a distance of some two miles, in the most direct course possible, from the pension of Madame Roget. 1126377|2|21|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8636|St. Eustache was the accepted suitor of Marie, and lodged, as well as took his meals, at the pension. 1126588|3|21|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8637|He was to have gone for his betrothed at dusk, and to have escorted her home. 1126689|4|21|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8638|In the afternoon, however, it came on to rain heavily; and, supposing that she would remain all night at her aunt's (as she had done under similar circumstances before), he did not think it necessary to keep his promise. 1126766|5|21|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8639|"As night drew on, Madame Roget (who was an infirm old lady, seventy years of age) was heard to express a fear ""that she should never see Marie again;"" but this observation attracted little attention at the time. 1126986"|6|21|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8640|On Monday it was ascertained that the girl had not been to the Rue des Dromes; and when the day elapsed without tidings of her, a tardy search was instituted at several points in the city and its environs. 1127197|0|23|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8641|It was not, however, until the fourth day from the period of her disappearance that any thing satisfactory was ascertained respecting her. 1127402|1|23|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8642|On this day (Wednesday, the twenty-fifth of June) a Monsieur Beauvais,* who, with a friend, had been making inquiries for Marie near the Barriere du Roule, on the shore of the Seine which is opposite the Rue Pavee St. Andree, was informed that a corpse had just been towed ashore by some fishermen, who had found it floating in the river. 1127540|2|23|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8643|Upon seeing the body, Beauvais, after some hesitation, identified it as that of the perfumery-girl. 1127878|3|23|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8644|His friend recognized it more promptly. 1127977|4|23|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8645|The face was suffused with dark blood, some of which issued from the mouth. 1128016|0|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8648|A piece of lace was found tied so tightly around the neck as to be hidden from sight; it was completely buried in the flesh, and was fastened by a knot which lay just under the left ear. 1128221|11|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8649|This alone would have sufficed to produce death. 1128407|12|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8653|There was no discoloration in the cellular tissue. 1128705|2|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8656|The right hand was clenched; the left partially open. 1128865|5|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8657|On the left wrist were two circular excoriations, apparently the effect of ropes, or of a rope in more than one volution. 1128918|6|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8658|A part of the right wrist, also, was much chafed, as well as the back throughout its extent, but more especially at the shoulder-blades. 1129039|7|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8659|In bringing the body to the shore the fishermen had attached to it a rope, but none of the excorations had been effected by this. 1129175|8|25|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8663|It was wound three times around the waist, and secured by a sort of hitch in the back. 1129513|2|26|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8664|The dress immediately beneath the frock was of fine muslin; and from this a slip eighteen inches wide had been torn entirely out-torn very evenly and with great care. 1129599|3|26|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8665|It was found around her neck, fitting loosely, and secured with a hard knot. 1129765|4|26|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8668|After the recognition of the corpse, it was not, as usual, taken to the Morgue (this formality being superfluous), but hastily interred not far from the spot at which it was brought ashore. 1130052|0|27|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8670|A weekly paper,* however, at length took up the theme; the corpse was disinterred, and a re-examination instituted; but nothing was elicited beyond what has been already noted. 1130400|2|27|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8671|The clothes, however, were now submitted to the mother and friends of the deceased, and fully identified as those worn by the girl upon leaving home. 1130576|3|27|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8677|As time passed and no discovery ensued, a thousand contradictory rumors were circulated and journalists busied themselves in suggestions. 1131133|4|29|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8678|Among these, the one which attracted the most notice, was the idea that Marie Roget still lived–that the corpse found in the Seine was that of some other unfortunate. 1131270|5|29|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8693|All experience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence, require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water. 1133481|18|31|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8694|Even where a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises before at least five or six days' immersion, it sinks again, if left alone. 1133706|19|31|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8695|There is no trace or tidings of her at all. 1133838|2|31|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8696|Now, we ask, what was there in this case to cause a departure from the ordinary course of nature? 1133881|20|31|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8697|If the body had been kept in its mangled state on shore until Tuesday night some trace would be found in shore of the murderers. 1133978|24|31|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8698|It is a doubtful point, also, whether the body would be so soon afloat, even were it thrown in after having been dead two days. 1134106|25|31|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8699|"And, furthermore, it is exceedingly improbable that any villains who had committed such a murder as is here supposed, would have thrown the body in without weight to sink it, when such a precaution could have so easily been taken"". 1134233"|26|31|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8700|There has no person, whatever, come forward, so far, who saw her at all in that day, after she left her mother's door. 1134464|6|31|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8701|"The editor here proceeds to argue that the body must have been in the water ""not three days merely, but, at least, five times three days,"" because it was so far decomposed that Beauvais had great difficulty in recognizing it. 1134582"|0|32|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8702|This latter point, however, was fully disproved. 1134807|1|32|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8703|"""What, then, are the facts on which M. Beauvais says that he had no doubt the body was that of Marie Roget? 1134855"|0|33|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8704|He ripped up the gown sleeve, and says he found marks which satisfied him of the identity. 1134962|1|33|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8705|The public generally supposed those marks to have consisted of some description of scars. 1135052|2|33|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8706|He rubbed the arm and found hair upon it- something as indefinite, we think, as can readily be imagined–as little conclusive as finding an arm in the sleeve. 1135141|3|33|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8707|M. Beauvais did not return that night, but sent word to Madame Roget, at seven o'clock, on Wednesday evening, that an investigation was still in progress respecting her daughter. 1135298|4|33|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8708|If we allow that Madame Roget, from her age and grief, could not go over (which is allowing a great deal), there certainly must have been some one who would have thought it worth while to go over and attend the investigation, if they thought the body was that of Marie. 1135476|5|33|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8709|Nobody went over. 1135745|6|33|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8710|There was nothing said or heard about the matter in the Rue Pavee St. Andree, that reached even the occupants of the same building. 1135762|7|33|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8711|M. St. Eustache, the lover and intended husband of Marie, who boarded in her mother's house, deposes that he did not hear of the discovery of the body of his intended until the next morning, when M. Beauvais came into his chamber and told him of it. 1135893|8|33|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8712|"For an item of news like this, it strikes us it was very coolly received"". 1136142"|9|33|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8713|In this way the journal endeavored to create the impression of an apathy on the part of the relatives of Marie, inconsistent with the supposition that these relatives believed the corpse to be hers. 1136216|0|34|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8714|Its insinuations amount to this:–that Marie, with the connivance of her friends, had absented herself from the city for reasons involving a charge against her chastity; and that these friends upon the discovery of a corpse in the Seine, somewhat resembling that of the girl, had availed themselves of the opportunity to impress the public with the belief of her death. 1136414|1|34|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8715|But L'Etoile was again overhasty. 1136782|2|34|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8716|It was distinctly proved that no apathy, such as was imagined, existed; that the old lady was exceedingly feeble, and so agitated as to be unable to attend to any duty; that St. Eustache, so far from receiving the news coolly, was distracted with grief, and bore himself so frantically, that M. Beauvais prevailed upon a friend and relative to take charge of him, and prevent his attending the examination at the disinterment. 1136815|3|34|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8717|Moreover, although it was stated by L'Etoile, that the corpse was re-interred at the public expense,–that an advantageous offer of private sepulture was absolutely declined by the family,–and that no member of the family attended the ceremonial:- although, I say, all this was asserted by L'Etoile in furtherance of the impression it designed to convey–yet all this was satisfactorily disproved. 1137241|4|34|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8718|In a subsequent number of the paper, an attempt was made to throw suspicion upon Beauvais himself. 1137636|5|34|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8719|"""Now, then, a change comes over the matter. 1137734"|0|35|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8720|We are told that, on one occasion, while a Madame B–was at Madame Roget's house, M. Beauvais, who was going out, told her that a gendarme was expected there, and that she, Madame B., must not say any thing to the gendarme until he returned, but let the matter be for him. 1137777|1|35|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8721|For some reason he determined that nobody shall have anything to do with the proceedings but himself, and he has elbowed the male relatives out of the way, according to their representations, in a very singular manner. 1138048|10|35|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8722|"He seems to have been very much averse to permitting the relatives to see the body"". 1138266"|11|35|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8723|In the present posture of affairs, M. Beauvais appears to have the whole matter locked up in his head. 1138350|5|35|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8724|A single step cannot be taken without M. Beauvais, for, go which way you will you run against him. 1138452|6|35|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8725|By the following fact, some color was given to the suspicion thus thrown upon Beauvais. 1138550|0|36|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8726|"A visitor at his office, a few days prior to the girl's disappearance, and during the absence of its occupant, had observed a rose in the key-hole of the door, and the name ""Marie"" inscribed upon a slate which hung near at hand. 1138637"|1|36|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8727|The general impression, so far as we were enabled to glean it from the newspapers, seemed to be, that Marie had been the victim of a gang of desperadoes–that by these she had been borne across the river, maltreated, and murdered. 1138865|0|37|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8728|Le Commerciel,* however, a print of extensive influence, was earnest in combatting this popular idea. 1139094|1|37|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8730|It is impossible that a person so well known to thousands as this young woman was, should have passed three blocks without some one having seen her; and any one who saw her would have remembered it, for she interested all who knew her. 1139318|1|39|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8731|A piece of one of the unfortunate girl's petticoats, two feet long and one foot wide, was torn out and tied under her chin around the back of her head, probably to prevent screams. 1139553|13|39|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8734|It is impossible that she could have gone to the Barriere du Roule, or to the Rue des Dromes, without being recognized by a dozen persons; yet no one has come forward who saw her outside of her mother's door, and there is no evidence, except the testimony concerning her expressed intentions, that she did go out at all. 1139853|6|39|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8735|Her gown was torn, bound round her, and tied; and by that the body was carried as a bundle. 1140173|7|39|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8736|If the murder had been committed at the Barriere du Roule, there would have been no necessity for any such arrangement. 1140264|8|39|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8737|The fact that the body was found floating near the Barriere, is no proof as to where it was thrown into the water. 1140383|9|39|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8738|THERE ARE few persons, even among the calmest thinkers, who have not occasionally been startled into a vague yet thrilling half-credence in the supernatural, by coincidences of so seemingly marvellous a character that, as mere coincidences, the intellect has been unable to receive them. 1140497|0|4|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8739|Such sentiments–for the half-credences of which I speak have never the full force of thought–such sentiments are seldom thoroughly stifled unless by reference to the doctrine of chance, or, as it is technically termed, the Calculus of Probabilities. 1140784|1|4|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8740|Now this Calculus is, in its essence, purely mathematical; and thus we have the anomaly of the most rigidly exact in science applied to the shadow and spirituality of the most intangible in speculation. 1141033|2|4|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8741|A day or two before the Prefect called upon us, however, some important information reached the police, which seemed to overthrow, at least, the chief portion of Le Commerciel's argument. 1141235|0|40|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8742|Two small boys, sons of a Madame Deluc, while roaming among the woods near the Barriere du Roule, chanced to penetrate a close thicket, within which were three or four large stones, forming a kind of seat with a back and footstool. 1141422|1|40|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8762|About three o'clock, in the afternoon of the Sunday in question, a young girl arrived at the inn, accompanied by a young man of dark complexion. 1143308|4|44|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8763|The two remained here for some time. 1143452|5|44|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8765|Madame Deluc's attention was called to the dress worn by the girl, on account of its resemblance to one worn by a deceased relative. 1143563|7|44|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8766|A scarf was particularly noticed. 1143695|8|44|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8767|Soon after the departure of the couple, a gang of miscreants made their appearance, behaved boisterously, ate and drank without making payment, followed in the route of the young man and girl, returned to the inn about dusk, and re-crossed the river as if in great haste. 1143728|9|44|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8782|' In the investigations at the house of Madame L'Espanaye,* the agents of G–were discouraged and confounded by that very unusualness which, to a properly regulated intellect, would have afforded the surest omen of success; while this same intellect might have been plunged in despair at the ordinary character of all that met the eye in the case of the perfumery girl, and yet told of nothing but easy triumph to the functionaries of the Prefecture. 1145548|10|48|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8830|Now, the assassination might have taken place upon the river's brink, or on the river itself; and, thus, the throwing the corpse in the water might have been resorted to at any period of the day or night, as the most obvious and most immediate mode of disposal. 1152957|6|54|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8834|All experience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence, require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water. 1153521|0|56|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8837|* This latter print endeavors to combat that portion of the paragraph which has reference to 'drowned bodies' only, by citing some five or six instances in which the bodies of individuals known to be drowned were found floating after the lapse of less time than is insisted upon by L'Etoile. 1153979|1|57|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8838|But there is something excessively unphilosophical in the attempt, on the part of Le Moniteur, to rebut the general assertion of L'Etoile, by a citation of particular instances militating against that assertion. 1154270|2|57|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8844|Now the human body, in general is neither much lighter nor much heavier than the water of the Seine; that is to say, the specific gravity of the human body, in its natural condition, is about equal to the bulk of fresh water which it displaces. 1155458|1|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8845|The result is the immersion of the mouth and nostrils, and the inception, during efforts to breathe while beneath the surface, of water into the lungs. 1155702|10|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8846|Much is also received into the stomach, and the whole body becomes heavier by the difference between the weight of the air originally distending these cavities, and that of the fluid which now fills them. 1155853|11|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8847|This difference is sufficient to cause the body to sink, as a general rule; but is insufficient in the case of individuals with small bones and an abnormal quantity of flaccid or fatty matter. 1156057|12|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8849|The bodies of fat and fleshy persons, with small bones, and of women generally, are lighter than those of the lean and large-boned, and of men; and the specific gravity of the water of a river is somewhat influenced by the presence of the tide from the sea. 1156292|2|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8850|But, leaving this tide out of the question, it may be said that very few human bodies will sink at all, even in fresh water, of their own accord. 1156549|3|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8851|Almost any one, falling into a river, will be enabled to float, if he suffer the specific gravity of the water fairly to be adduced in comparison with his own–that is to say, if he suffer his whole person to be immersed, with as little exception as possible. 1156694|4|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8852|The proper position for one who cannot swim, is the upright position of the walker on land, with the head thrown fully back, and immersed; the mouth and nostrils alone remaining above the surface. 1156952|5|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8853|Thus circumstanced; we shall find that we float without difficulty and without exertion. 1157148|6|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8854|It is evident, however, that the gravities of the body, and of the bulk of water displaced, are very nicely balanced, and that a trifle will cause either to preponderate. 1157236|7|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8855|An arm, for instance, uplifted from the water, and thus deprived of its support, is an additional weight sufficient to immerse the whole head, while the accidental aid of the smallest piece of timber will enable us to elevate the head so as to look about. 1157406|8|59|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8864|This may either loosen the corpse from the soft mud or ooze in which it is imbedded, thus permitting it to rise when other agencies have already prepared it for so doing, or it may overcome the tenacity of some putrescent portions of the cellular tissue, allowing the cavities to distend under the influence of the gas. 1158868|10|60|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8866|When this distension has so far progressed that the bulk of the corpse is materially increased without a corresponding increase of mass or weight, its specific gravity becomes less than that of the water displaced, and it forthwith makes its appearance at the surface. 1159349|3|60|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8867|But decomposition is modified by innumerable circumstances–is hastened or retarded by innumerable agencies; for example, by the heat or cold of the season, by the mineral impregnation or purity of the water, by its depth or shallowness, by its currency or stagnation, by the temperament of the body, by its infection or freedom from disease before death. 1159617|4|60|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8976|In this case, granting the personal acquaintances to be equal, the chances would be also equal that an equal number of personal encounters would be made. 1175089|12|73|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8977|For my own part, I should hold it not only as possible, but as very far more probable, that Marie might have proceeded, at any given period, by any one of the many routes between her own residence and that of her aunt, without meeting a single individual whom she knew, or by whom she was known. 1175242|13|73|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8978|In viewing this question in its full and proper light, we must hold steadily in mind the great disproportion between the personal acquaintances of even the most noted individual in Paris, and the entire population of Paris itself. 1175537|14|73|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8981|This is the idea of a man long resident in Paris–a public man–and one whose walks to and fro in the city have been mostly limited to the vicinity of the public offices. 1176045|4|73|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

8983|And, knowing the extent of his personal acquaintance with others, and of others with him, he compares his notoriety with that of the perfumery-girl, finds no great difference between them, and reaches at once the conclusion that she, in her walks, would be equally liable to recognition with himself in his. 1176331|6|73|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8984|This could only be the case were her walks of the same unvarying, methodical character, and within the same species of limited region as are his own. 1176638|7|73|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
8985|He passes to and fro, at regular intervals, within a confined periphery, abounding in individuals who are led to observation of his person through interest in the kindred nature of his occupation with their own. 1176787|8|73|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

9076|–Le Diligence, Thursday, June 26. 1188564|5|93|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9077|Upon reading these various extracts, they not only seemed to me irrelevant, but I could perceive no mode in which any one of them could be brought to bear upon the matter in hand. 1188597|0|95|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9078|I waited for some explanation from Dupin. 1188776|1|95|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9079|"""It is not my present design,"" he said, ""to dwell upon the first and second of these extracts. 1188817"|0|96|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9080|I have copied them chiefly to show you the extreme remissness of the police, who, as far as I can understand from the Prefect, have not troubled themselves, in any respect, with an examination of the naval officer alluded to. 1188911|1|96|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9081|Yet it is mere folly to say that between the first and second disappearance of Marie there is no supposable connection. 1189136|2|96|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9082|Let us admit the first elopement to have resulted in a quarrel between the lovers, and the return home of the betrayed. 1189255|3|96|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9083|We are now prepared to view a second elopement (if we know that an elopement has again taken place) as indicating a renewal of the betrayer's advances, rather than as the result of new proposals by a second individual–we are prepared to regard it as a 'making up' of the old amour, rather than as the commencement of a new one. 1189374|4|96|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9084|The chances are ten to one, that he who had once eloped with Marie would again propose an elopement, rather than that she to whom proposals of an elopement had been made by one individual, should have them made to her by another. 1189701|5|96|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9085|And here let me call your attention to the fact, that the time elapsing between the first ascertained and the second supposed elopement is a few months more than the general period of the cruises of our men-of-war. 1189930|6|96|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9086|Had the lover been interrupted in his first villainy by the necessity of departure to sea, and had he seized the first moment of his return to renew the base designs not yet altogether accomplished–or not yet altogether accomplished by him? 1190144|7|96|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9087|Of all these things we know nothing. 1190384|8|96|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9088|"""You will say, however, that, in the second instance, there was no elopement as imagined. 1190420"|0|97|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9089|Certainly not–but are we prepared to say that there was not the frustrated design? 1190509|1|97|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9090|Beyond St. Eustache, and perhaps Beauvais, we find no recognized, no open, no honorable suitors of Marie. 1190591|2|97|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9091|Of none other is there any thing said. 1190696|3|97|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9092|Who, then, is the secret lover, of whom the relatives (at least most of them) know nothing, but whom Marie meets upon the morning of Sunday, and who is so deeply in her confidence, that she hesitates not to remain with him until the shades of the evening descend, amid the solitary groves of the Barriere du Roule? 1190734|4|97|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9093|Who is that secret lover, I ask, of whom, at least, most of the relatives know nothing? 1191048|5|97|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9094|And what means the singular prophecy of Madam Roget on the morning of Marie's departure? 1191135|6|97|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9095|–'I fear that I shall never see Marie again. 1191223|7|97|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9096|"""But if we cannot imagine Madame Roget privy to the design of elopement, may we not at least suppose this design entertained by the girl? 1191267"|0|98|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9097|Upon quitting home, she gave it to be understood that she was about to visit her aunt in the Rue des Dromes, and St. Eustache was requested to call for her at dark. 1191404|1|98|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9098|Now, at first glance, this fact strongly militates against my suggestion;–but let us reflect. 1191568|2|98|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9099|That she did meet some companion, and proceed with him across the river, reaching the Barriere du Roule at so late an hour as three o'clock in the afternoon, is known. 1191661|3|98|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9100|But in consenting so to accompany this individual, (for whatever purpose–to her mother known or unknown,) she must have thought of her expressed intention when leaving home, and of the surprise and suspicion aroused in the bosom of her affianced suitor, St. Eustache, when, calling for her, at the hour appointed, in the Rue des Dromes, he should find that she had not been there, and when, moreover, upon returning to the pension with this alarming intelligence, he should become aware of her continued absence from home. 1191828|4|98|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9101|She must have thought of these things, I say. 1192350|5|98|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9102|She must have foreseen the chagrin of St. Eustache, the suspicion of all. 1192395|6|98|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9103|She could not have thought of returning to brave this suspicion; but the suspicion becomes a point of trivial importance to her, if we suppose her not intending to return. 1192468|7|98|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9104|"""We may imagine her thinking thus–'I am to meet a certain person for the purpose of elopement, or for certain other purposes known only to myself. 1192639"|0|99|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9105|It is necessary that there be no chance of interruption- there must be sufficient time given us to elude pursuit–I will give it to be understood that I shall visit and spend the day with my aunt at the Rue des Dromes–I will tell St. Eustache not to call for me until dark–in this way, my absence from home for the longest possible period, without causing suspicion or anxiety, will be accounted for, and I shall gain more time than in any other manner. 1192785|1|99|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9106|If I bid St. Eustache call for me at dark, he will be sure not to call before; but if I wholly neglect to bid him call, my time for escape will be diminished, since it will be expected that I return the earlier, and my absence will the sooner excite anxiety. 1193237|2|99|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9107|Now, if it were my design to return at all–if I had in contemplation merely a stroll with the individual in question–it would not be my policy to bid St. Eustache call; for, calling, he will be sure to ascertain that I have played him false–a fact of which I might keep him forever in ignorance, by leaving home without notifying him of my intention, by returning before dark, and by then stating that I had been to visit my aunt in the Rue des Dromes. 1193495|3|99|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9108|But, as it is my design never to return- or not for some weeks–or not until certain concealments are effected- the gaining of time is the only point about which I need give myself any concern. 1193947|4|99|The Mystery Of Marie Rogêt|1842-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
9109|It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. 1194139|0|0|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9110|Object there was none. 1194248|1|0|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9111|Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees --very gradually --I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever. 1194270|10|0|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9112|Passion there was none. 1194442|2|0|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9113|I loved the old man. 1194465|3|0|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9114|He had never wronged me. 1194485|4|0|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9115|He had never given me insult. 1194509|5|0|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9116|For his gold I had no desire. 1194538|6|0|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9117|I think it was his eye! 1194567|7|0|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9118|yes, it was this! 1194590|8|0|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9119|He had the eye of a vulture --a pale blue eye, with a film over it. 1194607|9|0|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9120|Now this is the point. 1194674|0|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9121|You fancy me mad. 1194696|1|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9122|It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. 1194713|10|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9123|Ha! 1194825|11|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9124|would a madman have been so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously --cautiously (for the hinges creaked) --I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. 1194828|12|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9125|And this I did for seven long nights --every night just at midnight --but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. 1195077|13|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9126|And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. 1195281|14|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9127|So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept. 1195463|15|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9128|Madmen know nothing. 1195607|2|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9129|But you should have seen me. 1195627|3|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9130|You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work! 1195655|4|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9131|I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. 1195782|5|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9132|And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it --oh so gently! 1195863|6|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9133|And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. 1195956|7|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9134|Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! 1196116|8|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9135|I moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man's sleep. 1196179|9|1|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9136|If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. 1196266|0|10|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9137|The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. 1196397|1|10|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9138|First of all I dismembered the corpse. 1196451|2|10|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9139|I cut off the head and the arms and the legs. 1196489|3|10|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9140|I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. 1196534|0|11|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9141|I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye --not even his --could have detected any thing wrong. 1196637|1|11|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9142|There was nothing to wash out --no stain of any kind --no blood-spot whatever. 1196762|2|11|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9143|I had been too wary for that. 1196840|3|11|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9144|A tub had caught all --ha! 1196869|4|11|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9145|ha! 1196895|5|11|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9146|When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock --still dark as midnight. 1196898|0|12|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9147|As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. 1196983|1|12|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9148|I went down to open it with a light heart, --for what had I now to fear? 1197054|2|12|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9149|There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the police. 1197126|3|12|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9150|A shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises. 1197226|4|12|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9151|I smiled, --for what had I to fear? 1197438|0|13|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9152|I bade the gentlemen welcome. 1197473|1|13|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9153|The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. 1197502|2|13|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9154|The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. 1197544|3|13|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9155|I took my visitors all over the house. 1197596|4|13|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9156|I bade them search --search well. 1197634|5|13|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9157|I led them, at length, to his chamber. 1197667|6|13|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9158|I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. 1197705|7|13|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9159|In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim. 1197754|8|13|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9160|The officers were satisfied. 1198018|0|14|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9161|My manner had convinced them. 1198046|1|14|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9162|I was singularly at ease. 1198075|2|14|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9163|They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. 1198100|3|14|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9164|But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. 1198173|4|14|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9165|My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted. 1198236|5|14|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9166|The ringing became more distinct: --It continued and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definiteness --until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears. 1198324|6|14|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9167|No doubt I now grew very pale; --but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. 1198554|0|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9168|Yet the sound increased --and what could I do? 1198643|1|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9169|I foamed --I raved --I swore! 1198689|10|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9170|I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. 1198718|11|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9171|It grew louder --louder --louder! 1198853|12|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9172|And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. 1198886|13|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9173|Was it possible they heard not? 1198935|14|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9174|Almighty God! 1198966|15|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9175|--no, no! 1198979|16|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9176|They heard! 1198988|17|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9177|--they suspected! 1198999|18|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9178|--they knew! 1199016|19|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9179|It was a low, dull, quick sound --much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. 1199028|2|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9180|--they were making a mockery of my horror! 1199122|20|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9181|-this I thought, and this I think. 1199164|21|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9182|But anything was better than this agony! 1199198|22|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9183|Anything was more tolerable than this derision! 1199238|23|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9184|I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! 1199285|24|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9185|I felt that I must scream or die! 1199334|25|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9186|and now --again! 1199367|26|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9187|--hark! 1199383|27|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9188|louder! 1199390|28|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9189|louder! 1199397|29|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9190|I gasped for breath --and yet the officers heard it not. 1199404|3|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9191|louder! 1199460|30|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9192|louder! 1199467|31|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9193|I talked more quickly --more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. 1199474|4|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9194|I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. 1199548|5|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9195|Why would they not be gone? 1199662|6|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9196|I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men --but the noise steadily increased. 1199689|7|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9197|Oh God! 1199826|8|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9198|what could I do? 1199833|9|15|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9199|"""Villains""! 1199849"|0|16|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9200|"I shrieked, ""dissemble no more! 1199860"|1|16|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9201|I admit the deed! 1199891|2|16|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9202|--tear up the planks! 1199908|3|16|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9203|here, here! 1199929|4|16|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9204|"--It is the beating of his hideous heart""! 1199940"|5|16|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9205|Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. 1199982|0|2|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9206|A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. 1200057|1|2|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9207|Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers --of my sagacity. 1200112|2|2|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9208|I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. 1200192|3|2|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9209|To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. 1200240|4|2|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9210|I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. 1200359|5|2|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9211|Now you may think that I drew back --but no. 1200464|6|2|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9212|His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily. 1200508|7|2|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9213|"I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out --""Who's there""? 1200734"|0|3|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9214|I kept quite still and said nothing. 1200894|0|4|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9215|For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. 1200930|1|4|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9216|He was still sitting up in the bed listening; --just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall. 1201020|2|4|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9217|Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror. 1201152|0|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9218|It was not a groan of pain or of grief --oh, no! 1201231|1|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9219|"He had been saying to himself --""It is nothing but the wind in the chimney --it is only a mouse crossing the floor,"" or ""It is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp"". 1201279"|10|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9220|Yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. 1201454|11|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9221|All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. 1201551|12|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9222|And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel --although he neither saw nor heard --to feel the presence of my head within the room. 1201669|13|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9223|--it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. 1201839|2|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9224|I knew the sound well. 1201936|3|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9225|Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. 1201958|4|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9226|I say I knew it well. 1202118|5|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9227|I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. 1202139|6|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9228|I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. 1202214|7|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9229|His fears had been ever since growing upon him. 1202315|8|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9230|He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. 1202362|9|5|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9231|When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little --a very, very little crevice in the lantern. 1202420|0|6|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9232|So I opened it --you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily --until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye. 1202570|1|6|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9233|It was open --wide, wide open --and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. 1202762|0|7|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9234|I saw it with perfect distinctness --all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old man's face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot. 1202832|1|7|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9235|And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over-acuteness of the sense? 1203095|0|8|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9236|--now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. 1203188|1|8|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9237|I knew that sound well, too. 1203297|2|8|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9238|It was the beating of the old man's heart. 1203325|3|8|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9239|It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage. 1203367|4|8|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9240|But even yet I refrained and kept still. 1203450|0|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9241|I scarcely breathed. 1203490|1|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9242|Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. 1203510|10|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9243|But the beating grew louder, louder! 1203567|11|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9244|I thought the heart must burst. 1203603|12|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9245|And now a new anxiety seized me --the sound would be heard by a neighbour! 1203634|13|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9246|The old man's hour had come! 1203708|14|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9247|With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. 1203736|15|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9248|He shrieked once --once only. 1203804|16|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9249|In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. 1203833|17|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9250|I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. 1203909|18|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9251|But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. 1203959|19|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9252|I held the lantern motionless. 1204021|2|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9253|This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. 1204051|20|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9254|At length it ceased. 1204121|21|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9255|The old man was dead. 1204141|22|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9256|I removed the bed and examined the corpse. 1204162|23|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9257|Yes, he was stone, stone dead. 1204204|24|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9258|I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. 1204234|25|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9259|There was no pulsation. 1204297|26|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9260|He was stone dead. 1204320|27|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9261|His eve would trouble me no more. 1204338|28|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9262|I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eve. 1204371|3|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9263|Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. 1204430|4|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9264|It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. 1204481|5|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9265|The old man's terror must have been extreme! 1204546|6|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9266|It grew louder, I say, louder every moment! 1204590|7|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9267|--do you mark me well I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. 1204633|8|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9268|And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. 1204698|9|9|The Tell-Tale Heart|1843-01-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
9269|What ho! 1204845|0|0|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9270|what ho! 1204853|1|0|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9271|this fellow is dancing mad! 1204861|2|0|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9272|He hath been bitten by the Tarantula. 1204888|3|0|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9273|All in the Wrong. 1204925|4|0|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9274|MANY years ago, I contracted an intimacy with a Mr. William Legrand. 1204942|0|1|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9275|He was of an ancient Huguenot family, and had once been wealthy; but a series of misfortunes had reduced him to want. 1205010|1|1|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9276|To avoid the mortification consequent upon his disasters, he left New Orleans, the city of his forefathers, and took up his residence at Sullivan's Island, near Charleston, South Carolina. 1205127|2|1|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9277|"""Dey aint no tin in him, Massa Will, I keep a tellin on you,"" here interrupted Jupiter; ""de bug is a goole bug, solid, ebery bit of him, inside and all, sep him wing --neber feel half so hebby a bug in my life"". 1205315"|0|10|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9278|"""How much fudder is got for go""? 1205526"|0|100|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9279|"""How high up are you""? 1205558"|0|101|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9280|asked Legrand. 1205580|1|101|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9281|"""Ebber so fur,"" replied the negro; ""can see de sky fru de top ob de tree"". 1205594"|0|102|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9282|"""Never mind the sky, but attend to what I say. 1205668"|0|103|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9283|Look down the trunk and count the limbs below you on this side. 1205714|1|103|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9284|"How many limbs have you passed""? 1205777"|2|103|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9287|In a few minutes the voice was heard again, announcing that the seventh limb was attained. 1205914|0|106|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9288|"""Now, Jup,"" cried Legrand, evidently much excited, ""I want you to work your way out upon that limb as far as you can. 1206004"|0|107|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9289|"If you see anything strange, let me know"". 1206121"|1|107|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9290|By this time what little doubt I might have entertained of my poor friend's insanity, was put finally at rest. 1206163|0|108|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9291|I had no alternative but to conclude him stricken with lunacy, and I became seriously anxious about getting him home. 1206273|1|108|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9292|While I was pondering upon what was best to be done, Jupiter's voice was again heard. 1206390|2|108|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9293|"""Mos' feerd for to ventur 'pon dis limb berry far --'tis dead limb putty much all de way"". 1206475"|0|109|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9294|"""Well, suppose it is, Jup,"" replied Legrand, somewhat more earnestly, it seemed to me, than the case demanded, ""is that any reason for your letting the birds burn? 1206565"|0|11|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9295|"The color"" --here he turned to me --""is really almost enough to warrant Jupiter's idea. 1206728"|1|11|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9296|You never saw a more brilliant metallic lustre than the scales emit --but of this you cannot judge till tomorrow. 1206815|2|11|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9297|"In the mean time I can give you some idea of the shape"". 1206928"|3|11|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9298|Saying this, he seated himself at a small table, on which were a pen and ink, but no paper. 1206984|4|11|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9299|He looked for some in a drawer, but found none. 1207075|5|11|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9379|During this colloquy no portion of Jupiter's person could be seen; but the beetle, which he had suffered to descend, was now visible at the end of the string, and glistened, like a globe of burnished gold, in the last rays of the setting sun, some of which still faintly illumined the eminence upon which we stood. 1211463|0|141|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9380|The scarabaeus hung quite clear of any branches, and, if allowed to fall, would have fAllan at our feet. 1211777|1|141|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9381|Legrand immediately took the scythe, and cleared with it a circular space, three or four yards in diameter, just beneath the insect, and, having accomplished this, ordered Jupiter to let go the string and come down from the tree. 1211881|2|141|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9382|Driving a peg, with great nicety, into the ground, at the precise spot where the beetle fell, my friend now produced from his pocket a tape-measure. 1212110|0|142|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9383|Fastening one end of this at that point of the trunk of the tree which was nearest the peg, he unrolled it till it reached the peg, and thence farther unrolled it, in the direction already established by the two points of the tree and the peg, for the distance of fifty feet --Jupiter clearing away the brambles with the scythe. 1212258|1|142|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9384|At the spot thus attained a second peg was driven, and about this, as a centre, a rude circle, about four feet in diameter, described. 1212586|2|142|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9385|Taking now a spade himself, and giving one to Jupiter and one to me, Legrand begged us to set about one to digging as quickly as possible. 1212720|3|142|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9386|To speak the truth, I had no especial relish for such amusement at any time, and, at that particular moment, would most willingly have declined it; for the night was coming on, and I felt much fatigued with the exercise already taken; but I saw no mode of escape, and was fearful of disturbing my poor friend's equanimity by a refusal. 1212858|0|143|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9387|Could I have depended, indeed, upon Jupiter's aid, I would have had no hesitation in attempting to get the lunatic home by force; but I was too well assured of the old negro's disposition, to hope that he would assist me, under any circumstances, in a personal contest with his master. 1213193|1|143|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9388|"I made no doubt that the latter had been infected with some of the innumerable Southern superstitions about money buried, and that his phantasy had received confirmation by the finding of the scarabaeus, or, perhaps, by Jupiter's obstinacy in maintaining it to be ""a bug of real gold"". 1213478"|2|143|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9389|"A mind disposed to lunacy would readily be led away by such suggestions --especially if chiming in with favorite preconceived ideas --and then I called to mind the poor fellow's speech about the beetle's being ""the index of his fortune"". 1213763"|3|143|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9390|Upon the whole, I was sadly vexed and puzzled, but, at length, I concluded to make a virtue of necessity --to dig with a good will, and thus the sooner to convince the visionary, by ocular demonstration, of the fallacy of the opinions he entertained. 1214000|4|143|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9391|The lanterns having been lit, we all fell to work with a zeal worthy a more rational cause; and, as the glare fell upon our persons and implements, I could not help thinking how picturesque a group we composed, and how strange and suspicious our labors must have appeared to any interloper who, by chance, might have stumbled upon our whereabouts. 1214250|0|144|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9392|We dug very steadily for two hours. 1214597|0|145|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9393|Little was said; and our chief embarrassment lay in the yelpings of the dog, who took exceeding interest in our proceedings. 1214632|1|145|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9394|He, at length, became so obstreperous that we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some stragglers in the vicinity; --or, rather, this was the apprehension of Legrand; --for myself, I should have rejoiced at any interruption which might have enabled me to get the wanderer home. 1214756|2|145|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9395|The noise was, at length, very effectually silenced by Jupiter, who, getting out of the hole with a dogged air of deliberation, tied the brute's mouth up with one of his suspenders, and then returned, with a grave chuckle, to his task. 1215037|3|145|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9396|When the time mentioned had expired, we had reached a depth of five feet, and yet no signs of any treasure became manifest. 1215272|0|146|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9398|Legrand, however, although evidently much disconcerted, wiped his brow thoughtfully and recommenced. 1215468|2|146|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9399|We had excavated the entire circle of four feet diameter, and now we slightly enlarged the limit, and went to the farther depth of two feet. 1215568|3|146|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9400|Still nothing appeared. 1215708|4|146|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9401|The gold-seeker, whom I sincerely pitied, at length clambered from the pit, with the bitterest disappointment imprinted upon every feature, and proceeded, slowly and reluctantly, to put on his coat, which he had thrown off at the beginning of his labor. 1215731|5|146|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9402|In the mean time I made no remark. 1215984|6|146|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9403|Jupiter, at a signal from his master, began to gather up his tools. 1216018|7|146|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9405|We had taken, perhaps, a dozen steps in this direction, when, with a loud oath, Legrand strode up to Jupiter, and seized him by the collar. 1216174|0|147|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9413|roared the terrified Jupiter, placing his hand upon his right organ of vision, and holding it there with a desperate pertinacity, as if in immediate dread of his master's attempt at a gouge. 1216713|2|149|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9414|"""Perhaps so,"" said I; ""but, Legrand, I fear you are no artist. 1216903"|0|15|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9415|"I must wait until I see the beetle itself, if I am to form any idea of its personal appearance"". 1216965"|1|15|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9419|vociferated Legrand, letting the negro go, and executing a series of curvets and caracols, much to the astonishment of his valet, who, arising from his knees, looked, mutely, from his master to myself, and then from myself to his master. 1217097|3|150|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9420|"""Come! 1217334"|0|151|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9421|"we must go back,"" said the latter, ""the game's not up yet;"" and he again led the way to the tulip-tree. 1217340"|1|151|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9422|"""Jupiter,"" said he, when we reached its foot, come here! 1217443"|0|152|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9426|--here Legrand touched each of Jupiter's eyes. 1217749|1|154|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9427|"""'Twas dis eye, massa --de lef' eye --jis as you tell me,"" and here it was his right eye that the negro indicated. 1217795"|0|155|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9429|Here my friend, about whose madness I now saw, or fancied that I saw, certain indications of method, removed the peg which marked the spot where the beetle fell, to a spot about three inches to the westward of its former position. 1217947|0|157|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9430|Taking, now, the tape-measure from the nearest point of the trunk to the peg, as before, and continuing the extension in a straight line to the distance of fifty feet, a spot was indicated, removed, by several yards, from the point at which we had been digging. 1218177|1|157|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9431|Around the new position a circle, somewhat larger than in the former instance, was now described, and we again set to work with the spades. 1218438|0|158|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9432|I was dreadfully weary, but, scarcely understanding what had occasioned the change in my thoughts, I felt no longer any great aversion from the labor imposed. 1218577|1|158|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9433|I had become most unaccountably interested --nay, even excited. 1218735|2|158|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9434|Perhaps there was something, amid all the extravagant demeanor of Legrand --some air of forethought, or of deliberation, which impressed me. 1218798|3|158|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9435|I dug eagerly, and now and then caught myself actually looking, with something that very much resembled expectation, for the fancied treasure, the vision of which had demented my unfortunate companion. 1218938|4|158|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9436|At a period when such vagaries of thought most fully possessed me, and when we had been at work perhaps an hour and a half, we were again interrupted by the violent howlings of the dog. 1219139|5|158|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9437|His uneasiness, in the first instance, had been, evidently, but the result of playfulness or caprice, but he now assumed a bitter and serious tone. 1219324|6|158|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9438|Upon Jupiter's again attempting to muzzle him, he made furious resistance, and, leaping into the hole, tore up the mould frantically with his claws. 1219471|7|158|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9439|In a few seconds he had uncovered a mass of human bones, forming two complete skeletons, intermingled with several buttons of metal, and what appeared to be the dust of decayed woollen. 1219619|8|158|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9440|One or two strokes of a spade upturned the blade of a large Spanish knife, and, as we dug farther, three or four loose pieces of gold and silver coin came to light. 1219804|9|158|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9441|At sight of these the joy of Jupiter could scarcely be restrained, but the countenance of his master wore an air of extreme disappointment. 1219968|0|159|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9442|He urged us, however, to continue our exertions, and the words were hardly uttered when I stumbled and fell forward, having caught the toe of my boot in a large ring of iron that lay half buried in the loose earth. 1220107|1|159|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9443|"""Well, I don't know,"" said he, a little nettled, ""I draw tolerably --should do it at least --have had good masters, and flatter myself that I am not quite a blockhead"". 1220321"|0|16|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9444|We now worked in earnest, and never did I pass ten minutes of more intense excitement. 1220489|0|160|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9445|During this interval we had fairly unearthed an oblong chest of wood, which, from its perfect preservation, and wonderful hardness, had plainly been subjected to some mineralizing process --perhaps that of the Bi-chloride of Mercury. 1220575|1|160|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9446|As the rays of the lanterns fell within the pit, there flashed upwards, from a confused heap of gold and of jewels, a glow and a glare that absolutely dazzled our eyes. 1220808|10|160|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9447|This box was three feet and a half long, three feet broad, and two and a half feet deep. 1220976|2|160|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9448|It was firmly secured by bands of wrought iron, riveted, and forming a kind of trellis-work over the whole. 1221064|3|160|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9449|On each side of the chest, near the top, were three rings of iron --six in all --by means of which a firm hold could be obtained by six persons. 1221171|4|160|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9450|Our utmost united endeavors served only to disturb the coffer very slightly in its bed. 1221315|5|160|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9451|We at once saw the impossibility of removing so great a weight. 1221402|6|160|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9452|Luckily, the sole fastenings of the lid consisted of two sliding bolts. 1221465|7|160|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9453|These we drew back --trembling and panting with anxiety. 1221536|8|160|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9454|In an instant, a treasure of incalculable value lay gleaming before us. 1221592|9|160|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9455|I shall not pretend to describe the feelings with which I gazed. 1221663|0|161|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9456|Amazement was, of course, predominant. 1221727|1|161|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9457|Legrand appeared exhausted with excitement, and spoke very few words. 1221765|2|161|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9458|Jupiter's countenance wore, for some minutes, as deadly a pallor as it is possible, in the nature of things, for any negro's visage to assume. 1221834|3|161|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9459|He seemed stupefied --thunder-stricken. 1221976|4|161|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9460|Presently he fell upon his knees in the pit, and, burying his naked arms up to the elbows in gold, let them there remain, as if enjoying the luxury of a bath. 1222015|5|161|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9461|At length, with a deep sigh, he exclaimed, as if in a soliloquy. 1222173|6|161|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9462|"""And dis all cum ob de goole-bug! 1222237"|0|162|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9466|"--answer me dat""! 1222394"|4|162|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9467|It became necessary, at last, that I should arouse both master and valet to the expediency of removing the treasure. 1222411|0|163|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9468|It was growing late, and it behooved us to make exertion, that we might get every thing housed before daylight. 1222527|1|163|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9469|It was difficult to say what should be done; and much time was spent in deliberation --so confused were the ideas of all. 1222638|2|163|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9470|We, finally, lightened the box by removing two thirds of its contents, when we were enabled, with some trouble, to raise it from the hole. 1222759|3|163|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9471|The articles taken out were deposited among the brambles, and the dog left to guard them, with strict orders from Jupiter neither, upon any pretence, to stir from the spot, nor to open his mouth until our return. 1222897|4|163|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9472|We then hurriedly made for home with the chest; reaching the hut in safety, but after excessive toil, at one o'clock in the morning. 1223109|5|163|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9473|Worn out as we were, it was not in human nature to do more just then. 1223241|6|163|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9474|We rested until two, and had supper; starting for the hills immediately afterwards, armed with three stout sacks, which, by good luck, were upon the premises. 1223310|7|163|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9475|A little before four we arrived at the pit, divided the remainder of the booty, as equally as might be, among us, and, leaving the holes unfilled, again set out for the hut, at which, for the second time, we deposited our golden burthens, just as the first streaks of the dawn gleamed from over the tree-tops in the East. 1223468|8|163|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9476|We were now thoroughly broken down; but the intense excitement of the time denied us repose. 1223789|0|164|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9477|After an unquiet slumber of some three or four hours' duration, we arose, as if by preconcert, to make examination of our treasure. 1223881|1|164|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9478|The chest had been full to the brim, and we spent the whole day, and the greater part of the next night, in a scrutiny of its contents. 1224012|0|165|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9479|There had been nothing like order or arrangement. 1224147|1|165|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9480|There were diamonds --some of them exceedingly large and fine --a hundred and ten in all, and not one of them small; eighteen rubies of remarkable brilliancy; --three hundred and ten emeralds, all very beautiful; and twenty-one sapphires, with an opal. 1224196|10|165|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9481|These stones had all been broken from their settings and thrown loose in the chest. 1224448|11|165|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9482|The settings themselves, which we picked out from among the other gold, appeared to have been beaten up with hammers, as if to prevent identification. 1224531|12|165|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9483|Besides all this, there was a vast quantity of solid gold ornaments; --nearly two hundred massive finger and ear rings; --rich chains --thirty of these, if I remember; --eighty-three very large and heavy crucifixes; --five gold censers of great value; --a prodigious golden punch-bowl, ornamented with richly chased vine-leaves and Bacchanalian figures; with two sword-handles exquisitely embossed, and many other smaller articles which I cannot recollect. 1224681|13|165|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9484|The weight of these valuables exceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois; and in this estimate I have not included one hundred and ninety-seven superb gold watches; three of the number being worth each five hundred dollars, if one. 1225137|14|165|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9485|Many of them were very old, and as time keepers valueless; the works having suffered, more or less, from corrosion --but all were richly jewelled and in cases of great worth. 1225377|15|165|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9486|We estimated the entire contents of the chest, that night, at a million and a half of dollars; and, upon the subsequent disposal of the trinkets and jewels (a few being retained for our own use), it was found that we had greatly undervalued the treasure. 1225551|16|165|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9487|Every thing had been heaped in promiscuously. 1225805|2|165|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9488|Having assorted all with care, we found ourselves possessed of even vaster wealth than we had at first supposed. 1225850|3|165|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9489|In coin there was rather more than four hundred and fifty thousand dollars --estimating the value of the pieces, as accurately as we could, by the tables of the period. 1225962|4|165|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9490|There was not a particle of silver. 1226130|5|165|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9491|All was gold of antique date and of great variety --French, Spanish, and German money, with a few English guineas, and some counters, of which we had never seen specimens before. 1226165|6|165|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9492|There were several very large and heavy coins, so worn that we could make nothing of their inscriptions. 1226343|7|165|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9493|There was no American money. 1226447|8|165|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9494|The value of the jewels we found more difficulty in estimating. 1226475|9|165|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9495|When, at length, we had concluded our examination, and the intense excitement of the time had, in some measure, subsided, Legrand, who saw that I was dying with impatience for a solution of this most extraordinary riddle, entered into a full detail of all the circumstances connected with it. 1226538|0|166|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9496|"""You remember,"" said he, ""the night when I handed you the rough sketch I had made of the scarabaeus. 1226830"|0|167|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9497|You recollect also, that I became quite vexed at you for insisting that my drawing resembled a death's-head. 1226930|1|167|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9498|When you first made this assertion I thought you were jesting; but afterwards I called to mind the peculiar spots on the back of the insect, and admitted to myself that your remark had some little foundation in fact. 1227038|2|167|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9499|"Still, the sneer at my graphic powers irritated me --for I am considered a good artist --and, therefore, when you handed me the scrap of parchment, I was about to crumple it up and throw it angrily into the fire"". 1227254"|3|167|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9500|"""No; it had much of the appearance of paper, and at first I supposed it to be such, but when I came to draw upon it, I discovered it, at once, to be a piece of very thin parchment. 1227467"|0|169|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9501|It was quite dirty, you remember. 1227647|1|169|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9502|The mind struggles to establish a connection --a sequence of cause and effect --and, being unable to do so, suffers a species of temporary paralysis. 1227680|10|169|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9503|But, when I recovered from this stupor, there dawned upon me gradually a conviction which startled me even far more than the coincidence. 1227829|11|169|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9504|I began distinctly, positively, to remember that there had been no drawing on the parchment when I made my sketch of the scarabaeus. 1227966|12|169|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9505|I became perfectly certain of this; for I recollected turning up first one side and then the other, in search of the cleanest spot. 1228098|13|169|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9506|Had the skull been then there, of course I could not have failed to notice it. 1228229|14|169|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9507|Here was indeed a mystery which I felt it impossible to explain; but, even at that early moment, there it seemed to glimmer, faintly, within the most remote and secret chambers of my intellect, a glow-worm-like conception of that truth which last night's adventure brought to so magnificent a demonstration. 1228307|15|169|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9508|I arose at once, and putting the parchment securely away, dismissed all farther reflection until I should be alone. 1228614|16|169|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9509|Well, as I was in the very act of crumpling it up, my glance fell upon the sketch at which you had been looking, and you may imagine my astonishment when I perceived, in fact, the figure of a death's-head just where, it seemed to me, I had made the drawing of the beetle. 1228729|2|169|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9510|For a moment I was too much amazed to think with accuracy. 1229000|3|169|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9511|I knew that my design was very different in detail from this --although there was a certain similarity in general outline. 1229058|4|169|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9512|Presently I took a candle, and seating myself at the other end of the room, proceeded to scrutinize the parchment more closely. 1229180|5|169|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9513|Upon turning it over, I saw my own sketch upon the reverse, just as I had made it. 1229307|6|169|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9514|My first idea, now, was mere surprise at the really remarkable similarity of outline --at the singular coincidence involved in the fact, that unknown to me, there should have been a skull upon the other side of the parchment, immediately beneath my figure of the scarabaeus and that this skull, not only in outline, but in size, should so closely resemble my drawing. 1229389|7|169|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9515|I say the singularity of this coincidence absolutely stupefied me for a time. 1229756|8|169|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9516|This is the usual effect of such coincidences. 1229833|9|169|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9517|"""But, my dear fellow, you are joking then,"" said I, ""this is a very passable skull --indeed, I may say that it is a very excellent skull, according to the vulgar notions about such specimens of physiology --and your scarabaeus must be the queerest scarabaeus in the world if it resembles it. 1229879"|0|17|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9518|Why, we may get up a very thrilling bit of superstition upon this hint. 1230170|1|17|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9519|I presume you will call the bug scarabaeus caput hominis, or something of that kind --there are many titles in the Natural Histories. 1230241|2|17|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9520|"But where are the antennae you spoke of""? 1230374"|3|17|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9521|"""When you had gone, and when Jupiter was fast asleep, I betook myself to a more methodical investigation of the affair. 1230415"|0|170|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9522|In the first place I considered the manner in which the parchment had come into my possession. 1230534|1|170|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9523|The spot where we discovered the scarabaeus was on the coast of the main land, about a mile eastward of the island, and but a short distance above high water mark. 1230628|2|170|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9524|Upon my taking hold of it, it gave me a sharp bite, which caused me to let it drop. 1230791|3|170|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9525|Jupiter, with his accustomed caution, before seizing the insect, which had flown towards him, looked about him for a leaf, or something of that nature, by which to take hold of it. 1230874|4|170|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9526|It was at this moment that his eyes, and mine also, fell upon the scrap of parchment, which I then supposed to be paper. 1231054|5|170|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9527|It was lying half buried in the sand, a corner sticking up. 1231174|6|170|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9528|Near the spot where we found it, I observed the remnants of the hull of what appeared to have been a ship's long boat. 1231233|7|170|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9529|The wreck seemed to have been there for a very great while; for the resemblance to boat timbers could scarcely be traced. 1231351|8|170|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9530|"""Well, Jupiter picked up the parchment, wrapped the beetle in it, and gave it to me. 1231472"|0|171|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9531|Soon afterwards we turned to go home, and on the way met Lieutenant G--. 1231556|1|171|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9532|I showed him the insect, and he begged me to let him take it to the fort. 1231628|2|171|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9533|On my consenting, he thrust it forthwith into his waistcoat pocket, without the parchment in which it had been wrapped, and which I had continued to hold in my hand during his inspection. 1231701|3|171|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9534|Perhaps he dreaded my changing my mind, and thought it best to make sure of the prize at once --you know how enthusiastic he is on all subjects connected with Natural History. 1231888|4|171|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9535|At the same time without being conscious of it, I must have deposited the parchment in my own pocket. 1232063|5|171|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9536|"""You remember that when I went to the table, for the purpose of making a sketch of the beetle, I found no paper where it was usually kept. 1232164"|0|172|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9537|I looked in the drawer, and found none there. 1232302|1|172|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9538|I searched my pockets, hoping to find an old letter --and then my hand fell upon the parchment. 1232347|2|172|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9539|I thus detail the precise mode in which it came into my possession; for the circumstances impressed me with peculiar force. 1232442|3|172|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9540|"""No doubt you will think me fanciful --but I had already established a kind of connexion. 1232565"|0|173|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9541|I had put together two links of a great chain. 1232654|1|173|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9542|There was a boat lying on a sea-coast, and not far from the boat was a parchment --not a paper --with a skull depicted on it. 1232700|2|173|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9543|You will, of course, ask 'where is the connexion? 1232825|3|173|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9544|' I reply that the skull, or death's-head, is the well-known emblem of the pirate. 1232874|4|173|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9545|The flag of the death's-head is hoisted in all engagements. 1232956|5|173|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9546|"""I have said that the scrap was parchment, and not paper. 1233015"|0|174|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9547|Parchment is durable --almost imperishable. 1233072|1|174|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9548|Matters of little moment are rarely consigned to parchment; since, for the mere ordinary purposes of drawing or writing, it is not nearly so well adapted as paper. 1233115|2|174|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9549|This reflection suggested some meaning --some relevancy --in the death's-head. 1233278|3|174|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9550|I did not fail to observe, also, the form of the parchment. 1233356|4|174|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9551|Although one of its corners had been, by some accident, destroyed, it could be seen that the original form was oblong. 1233415|5|174|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9552|"It was just such a slip, indeed, as might have been chosen for a memorandum --for a record of something to be long remembered and carefully preserved"". 1233533"|6|174|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9553|"""But,"" I interposed, ""you say that the skull was not upon the parchment when you made the drawing of the beetle. 1233684"|0|175|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9554|"How then do you trace any connexion between the boat and the skull --since this latter, according to your own admission, must have been designed (God only knows how or by whom) at some period subsequent to your sketching the scarabaeus""? 1233796"|1|175|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9555|"""Ah, hereupon turns the whole mystery; although the secret, at this point, I had comparatively little difficulty in solving. 1234033"|0|176|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9556|My steps were sure, and could afford but a single result. 1234157|1|176|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9557|I reasoned, for example, thus: When I drew the scarabaeus, there was no skull apparent on the parchment. 1234214|2|176|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9558|When I had completed the drawing, I gave it to you, and observed you narrowly until you returned it. 1234318|3|176|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9559|You, therefore, did not design the skull, and no one else was present to do it. 1234418|4|176|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9560|Then it was not done by human agency. 1234497|5|176|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9561|And nevertheless it was done. 1234534|6|176|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9562|"""At this stage of my reflections I endeavored to remember, and did remember, with entire distinctness, every incident which occurred about the period in question. 1234563"|0|177|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9563|The weather was chilly (oh rare and happy accident! 1234725|1|177|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9564|Zaire, digested in aqua regia, and diluted with four times its weight of water, is sometimes employed; a green tint results. 1234776|10|177|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9565|The regulus of cobalt, dissolved in spirit of nitre, gives a red. 1234900|11|177|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9566|These colors disappear at longer or shorter intervals after the material written on cools, but again become apparent upon the re-application of heat. 1234965|12|177|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9567|), and a fire was blazing on the hearth. 1235114|2|177|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9568|I was heated with exercise and sat near the table. 1235154|3|177|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9569|You, however, had drawn a chair close to the chimney. 1235204|4|177|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9570|Just as I placed the parchment in your hand, and as you were in the act of inspecting it, Wolf, the Newfoundland, entered, and leaped upon your shoulders. 1235257|5|177|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9571|With your left hand you caressed him and kept him off, while your right, holding the parchment, was permitted to fall listlessly between your knees, and in close proximity to the fire. 1235411|6|177|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9572|At one moment I thought the blaze had caught it, and was about to caution you, but, before I could speak, you had withdrawn it, and were engaged in its examination. 1235595|7|177|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9573|When I considered all these particulars, I doubted not for a moment that heat had been the agent in bringing to light, on the parchment, the skull which I saw designed on it. 1235759|8|177|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9574|You are well aware that chemical preparations exist, and have existed time out of mind, by means of which it is possible to write on either paper or vellum, so that the characters shall become visible only when subjected to the action of fire. 1235933|9|177|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9575|"""I now scrutinized the death's-head with care. 1236176"|0|178|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9576|Its outer edges --the edges of the drawing nearest the edge of the vellum --were far more distinct than the others. 1236222|1|178|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9577|It was clear that the action of the caloric had been imperfect or unequal. 1236337|2|178|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9578|I immediately kindled a fire, and subjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing heat. 1236411|3|178|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9579|At first, the only effect was the strengthening of the faint lines in the skull; but, on persevering in the experiment, there became visible, at the corner of the slip, diagonally opposite to the spot in which the death's-head was delineated, the figure of what I at first supposed to be a goat. 1236504|4|178|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9580|"A closer scrutiny, however, satisfied me that it was intended for a kid"". 1236799"|5|178|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9592|I say signature; because its position on the vellum suggested this idea. 1237741|3|182|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9598|I can scarcely say why. 1238241|2|184|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9599|Perhaps, after all, it was rather a desire than an actual belief; --but do you know that Jupiter's silly words, about the bug being of solid gold, had a remarkable effect on my fancy? 1238264|3|184|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9652|It had been my to pass the night at the hut, as I had frequently done before, but, seeing my host in this mood, I deemed it proper to take leave. 1244382|10|20|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9653|He did not press me to remain, but, as I departed, he shook my hand with even more than his usual cordiality. 1244527|11|20|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9654|For some minutes he continued to scrutinize the drawing minutely where he sat. 1244636|2|20|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9655|At length he arose, took a candle from the table, and proceeded to seat himself upon a sea-chest in the farthest corner of the room. 1244714|3|20|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9657|He said nothing, however, and his conduct greatly astonished me; yet I thought it prudent not to exacerbate the growing moodiness of his temper by any comment. 1244931|5|20|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9658|Presently he took from his coat pocket a wallet, placed the paper carefully in it, and deposited both in a writing-desk, which he locked. 1245090|6|20|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9659|He now grew more composed in his demeanor; but his original air of enthusiasm had quite disappeared. 1245227|7|20|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9661|As the evening wore away he became more and more absorbed in reverie, from which no sallies of mine could arouse him. 1245373|9|20|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9662|"""In the present case --indeed in all cases of secret writing --the first question regards the language of the cipher; for the principles of solution, so far, especially, as the more simple ciphers are concerned, depend on, and are varied by, the genius of the particular idiom. 1245490"|0|200|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9670|In such case I should have commenced with a collation and analysis of the shorter words, and, had a word of a single letter occurred, as is most likely, (a or I, for example,) I should have considered the solution as assured. 1246472|2|201|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9693|The general use which may be made of the table is obvious --but, in this particular cipher, we shall only very partially require its aid. 1247585|1|217|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9694|As our predominant character is 8, we will commence by assuming it as the e of the natural alphabet. 1247722|2|217|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9695|To verify the supposition, let us observe if the 8 be seen often in couples --for e is doubled with great frequency in English --in such words, for example, as 'meet,' 'fleet,' 'speed, 'seen,' 'been,' 'agree,' &amp;c. 1247822|3|217|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9766|This ledge projected about eighteen inches, and was not more than a foot wide, while a niche in the cliff just above it, gave it a rude resemblance to one of the hollow-backed chairs used by our ancestors. 1254589|1|267|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9771|Nor did I hesitate to believe that the phrases, 'twenty-one degrees and thirteen minutes,' and northeast and by north,' were intended as directions for the levelling of the glass. 1255195|2|268|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9772|Greatly excited by these discoveries, I hurried home, procured a telescope, and returned to the rock. 1255374|3|268|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9774|This fact confirmed my preconceived idea. 1255598|1|269|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9775|I proceeded to use the glass. 1255639|2|269|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9776|Of course, the 'twenty-one degrees and thirteen minutes' could allude to nothing but elevation above the visible horizon, since the horizontal direction was clearly indicated by the words, 'northeast and by north. 1255668|3|269|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9777|' This latter direction I at once established by means of a pocket-compass; then, pointing the glass as nearly at an angle of twenty-one degrees of elevation as I could do it by guess, I moved it cautiously up or down, until my attention was arrested by a circular rift or opening in the foliage of a large tree that overtopped its fellows in the distance. 1255881|4|269|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9778|In the centre of this rift I perceived a white spot, but could not, at first, distinguish what it was. 1256237|5|269|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9779|Adjusting the focus of the telescope, I again looked, and now made it out to be a human skull. 1256339|6|269|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9788|What seems to me the chief ingenuity in this whole business, is the fact (for repeated experiment has convinced me it is a fact) that the circular opening in question is visible from no other attainable point of view than that afforded by the narrow ledge on the face of the rock. 1257652|2|272|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9850|About the middle of October, 18--, there occurred, however, a day of remarkable chilliness. 1264472|1|4|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9851|Just before sunset I scrambled my way through the evergreens to the hut of my friend, whom I had not visited for several weeks --my residence being, at that time, in Charleston, a distance of nine my miles from the Island, while the facilities of passage and re-passage were very far behind those of the present day. 1264563|2|4|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9854|It was a novelty, and by no means an ungrateful one. 1265070|5|4|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9872|He had found an unknown bivalve, forming a new genus, and, more than this, he had hunted down and secured, with Jupiter's assistance, a scarabaeus which he believed to be totally new, but in respect to which he wished to have my opinion on the morrow. 1266199|4|5|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9885|There was something in the tone of this note which gave me great uneasiness. 1267218|0|56|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9886|Its whole style differed materially from that of Legrand. 1267294|1|56|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9887|What could he be dreaming of? 1267351|2|56|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9888|What new crotchet possessed his excitable brain? 1267380|3|56|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9889|"What ""business of the highest importance"" could he possibly have to transact? 1267428"|4|56|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9890|Jupiter's account of him boded no good. 1267505|5|56|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9891|I dreaded lest the continued pressure of misfortune had, at length, fairly unsettled the reason of my friend. 1267544|6|56|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9892|Without a moment's hesitation, therefore, I prepared to accompany the negro. 1267653|7|56|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9893|Upon reaching the wharf, I noticed a scythe and three spades, all apparently new, lying in the bottom of the boat in which we were to embark. 1267729|0|57|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9899|"""Very true; but what are they doing here""? 1268068"|0|60|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9905|With a fair and strong breeze we soon ran into the little cove to the northward of Fort Moultrie, and a walk of some two miles brought us to the hut. 1268626|1|64|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9906|It was about three in the afternoon when we arrived. 1268775|2|64|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9907|Legrand had been awaiting us in eager expectation. 1268827|3|64|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9908|He grasped my hand with a nervous empressement which alarmed me and strengthened the suspicions already entertained. 1268877|4|64|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9909|His countenance was pale even to ghastliness, and his deep-set eyes glared with unnatural lustre. 1268993|5|64|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9910|After some inquiries respecting his health, I asked him, not knowing what better to say, if he had yet obtained the scarabaeus from Lieutenant G--. 1269090|6|64|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9911|"""Oh, yes,"" he replied, coloring violently, ""I got it from him the next morning. 1269237"|0|65|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9912|Nothing should tempt me to part with that scarabaeus. 1269316|1|65|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9913|"Do you know that Jupiter is quite right about it""? 1269369"|2|65|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9914|"""In what way""? 1269419"|0|66|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9915|I asked, with a sad foreboding at heart. 1269433|1|66|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9916|"""In supposing it to be a bug of real gold"". 1269473"|0|67|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9917|He said this with an air of profound seriousness, and I felt inexpressibly shocked. 1269516|1|67|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9920|Since Fortune has thought fit to bestow it upon me, I have only to use it properly and I shall arrive at the gold of which it is the index. 1269754|2|68|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9926|It was a beautiful scarabaeus, and, at that time, unknown to naturalists --of course a great prize in a scientific point of view. 1270146|4|69|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9927|There were two round, black spots near one extremity of the back, and a long one near the other. 1270275|5|69|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9928|The scales were exceedingly hard and glossy, with all the appearance of burnished gold. 1270371|6|69|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9929|The weight of the insect was very remarkable, and, taking all things into consideration, I could hardly blame Jupiter for his opinion respecting it; but what to make of Legrand's agreement with that opinion, I could not, for the life of me, tell. 1270458|7|69|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9964|With a heavy heart I accompanied my friend. 1272863|0|86|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9965|We started about four o'clock --Legrand, Jupiter, the dog, and myself. 1272906|1|86|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9966|Jupiter had with him the scythe and spades --the whole of which he insisted upon carrying --more through fear, it seemed to me, of trusting either of the implements within reach of his master, than from any excess of industry or complaisance. 1272976|2|86|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

9968|For my own part, I had charge of a couple of dark lanterns, while Legrand contented himself with the scarabaeus, which he carried attached to the end of a bit of whip-cord; twirling it to and fro, with the air of a conjuror, as he went. 1273339|4|86|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9969|When I observed this last, plain evidence of my friend's aberration of mind, I could scarcely refrain from tears. 1273575|5|86|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9970|I thought it best, however, to humor his fancy, at least for the present, or until I could adopt some more energetic measures with a chance of success. 1273688|6|86|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9971|In the mean time I endeavored, but all in vain, to sound him in regard to the object of the expedition. 1273839|7|86|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9972|"Having succeeded in inducing me to accompany him, he seemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any topic of minor importance, and to all my questions vouchsafed no other reply than ""we shall see""! 1273942"|8|86|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9973|We crossed the creek at the head of the island by means of a skiff, and, ascending the high grounds on the shore of the mainland, proceeded in a northwesterly direction, through a tract of country excessively wild and desolate, where no trace of a human footstep was to be seen. 1274139|0|87|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9974|Legrand led the way with decision; pausing only for an instant, here and there, to consult what appeared to be certain landmarks of his own contrivance upon a former occasion. 1274417|1|87|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9975|In this manner we journeyed for about two hours, and the sun was just setting when we entered a region infinitely more dreary than any yet seen. 1274592|0|88|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9976|It was a species of table land, near the summit of an almost inaccessible hill, densely wooded from base to pinnacle, and interspersed with huge crags that appeared to lie loosely upon the soil, and in many cases were prevented from precipitating themselves into the valleys below, merely by the support of the trees against which they reclined. 1274736|1|88|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9977|Deep ravines, in various directions, gave an air of still sterner solemnity to the scene. 1275081|2|88|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9978|The natural platform to which we had clambered was thickly overgrown with brambles, through which we soon discovered that it would have been impossible to force our way but for the scythe; and Jupiter, by direction of his master, proceeded to clear for us a path to the foot of an enormously tall tulip-tree, which stood, with some eight or ten oaks, upon the level, and far surpassed them all, and all other trees which I had then ever seen, in the beauty of its foliage and form, in the wide spread of its branches, and in the general majesty of its appearance. 1275170|0|89|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9979|When we reached this tree, Legrand turned to Jupiter, and asked him if he thought he could climb it. 1275733|1|89|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9980|The old man seemed a little staggered by the question, and for some moments made no reply. 1275833|2|89|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
9981|At length he approached the huge trunk, walked slowly around it, and examined it with minute attention. 1275923|3|89|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

10002|Here he took cautiously hold of the extreme end of the string, and, maintaining the insect as far from his person as circumstances would permit, prepared to ascend the tree. 1277116|5|96|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
10003|In youth, the tulip-tree, or Liriodendron Tulipiferum, the most magnificent of American foresters, has a trunk peculiarly smooth, and often rises to a great height without lateral branches; but, in its riper age, the bark becomes gnarled and uneven, while many short limbs make their appearance on the stem. 1277289|0|97|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
10004|Thus the difficulty of ascension, in the present case, lay more in semblance than in reality. 1277596|1|97|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
10005|Embracing the huge cylinder, as closely as possible, with his arms and knees, seizing with his hands some projections, and resting his naked toes upon others, Jupiter, after one or two narrow escapes from falling, at length wriggled himself into the first great fork, and seemed to consider the whole business as virtually accomplished. 1277689|2|97|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
10006|The risk of the achievement was, in fact, now over, although the climber was some sixty or seventy feet from the ground. 1278025|3|97|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']

10010|The negro obeyed him promptly, and apparently with but little trouble; ascending higher and higher, until no glimpse of his squat figure could be obtained through the dense foliage which enveloped it. 1278254|1|99|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
10011|Presently his voice was heard in a sort of halloo. 1278454|2|99|The Gold-Bug|1843-06-25 00:00:00|['Adventure']
10012|FOR the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about to pen, I neither expect nor solicit belief. 1278504|0|1|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10013|Mad indeed would I be to expect it, in a case where my very senses reject their own evidence. 1278610|1|1|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10014|Yet, mad am I not --and very surely do I not dream. 1278703|2|1|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10015|But to-morrow I die, and to-day I would unburthen my soul. 1278754|3|1|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10016|My immediate purpose is to place before the world, plainly, succinctly, and without comment, a series of mere household events. 1278812|4|1|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10017|In their consequences, these events have terrified --have tortured --have destroyed me. 1278939|5|1|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10018|Yet I will not attempt to expound them. 1279026|6|1|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10019|To me, they have presented little but Horror --to many they will seem less terrible than baroques. 1279065|7|1|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10020|Hereafter, perhaps, some intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the common-place --some intellect more calm, more logical, and far less excitable than my own, which will perceive, in the circumstances I detail with awe, nothing more than an ordinary succession of very natural causes and effects. 1279163|8|1|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10021|On the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done, I was aroused from sleep by the cry of fire. 1279476|0|10|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10022|The curtains of my bed were in flames. 1279579|1|10|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10023|The whole house was blazing. 1279617|2|10|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10024|It was with great difficulty that my wife, a servant, and myself, made our escape from the conflagration. 1279645|3|10|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10025|The destruction was complete. 1279750|4|10|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10026|My entire worldly wealth was swallowed up, and I resigned myself thenceforward to despair. 1279779|5|10|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10027|I am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of cause and effect, between the disaster and the atrocity. 1279869|0|11|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10028|But I am detailing a chain of facts --and wish not to leave even a possible link imperfect. 1279987|1|11|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10029|I approached and saw, as if graven in bas relief upon the white surface, the figure of a gigantic cat. 1280078|10|11|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10030|The impression was given with an accuracy truly marvellous. 1280180|11|11|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10031|There was a rope about the animal's neck. 1280239|12|11|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10032|On the day succeeding the fire, I visited the ruins. 1280280|2|11|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10033|The walls, with one exception, had fAllan in. 1280332|3|11|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10034|This exception was found in a compartment wall, not very thick, which stood about the middle of the house, and against which had rested the head of my bed. 1280377|4|11|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10035|The plastering had here, in great measure, resisted the action of the fire --a fact which I attributed to its having been recently spread. 1280532|5|11|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10036|About this wall a dense crowd were collected, and many persons seemed to be examining a particular portion of it with every minute and eager attention. 1280670|6|11|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10037|"The words ""strange""! 1280821"|7|11|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10038|"""singular""! 1280841"|8|11|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10039|and other similar expressions, excited my curiosity. 1280852|9|11|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10040|When I first beheld this apparition --for I could scarcely regard it as less --my wonder and my terror were extreme. 1280904|0|12|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10041|But at length reflection came to my aid. 1281020|1|12|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10042|The cat, I remembered, had been hung in a garden adjacent to the house. 1281060|2|12|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10043|Upon the alarm of fire, this garden had been immediately filled by the crowd --by some one of whom the animal must have been cut from the tree and thrown, through an open window, into my chamber. 1281131|3|12|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10044|This had probably been done with the view of arousing me from sleep. 1281326|4|12|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10045|The falling of other walls had compressed the victim of my cruelty into the substance of the freshly-spread plaster; the lime of which, had then with the flames, and the ammonia from the carcass, accomplished the portraiture as I saw it. 1281394|5|12|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10046|Although I thus readily accounted to my reason, if not altogether to my conscience, for the startling fact 'just detailed, it did not the less fall to make a deep impression upon my fancy. 1281631|0|13|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10047|For months I could not rid myself of the phantasm of the cat; and, during this period, there came back into my spirit a half-sentiment that seemed, but was not, remorse. 1281819|1|13|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10048|I went so far as to regret the loss of the animal, and to look about me, among the vile haunts which I now habitually frequented, for another pet of the same species, and of somewhat similar appearance, with which to supply its place. 1281988|2|13|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10049|One night as I sat, half stupefied, in a den of more than infamy, my attention was suddenly drawn to some black object, reposing upon the head of one of the immense hogsheads of Gin, or of Rum, which constituted the chief furniture of the apartment. 1282222|0|14|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10050|I had been looking steadily at the top of this hogshead for some minutes, and what now caused me surprise was the fact that I had not sooner perceived the object thereupon. 1282471|1|14|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10051|I approached it, and touched it with my hand. 1282643|2|14|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10052|It was a black cat --a very large one --fully as large as Pluto, and closely resembling him in every respect but one. 1282688|3|14|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10053|Pluto had not a white hair upon any portion of his body; but this cat had a large, although indefinite splotch of white, covering nearly the whole region of the breast. 1282805|4|14|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10054|Upon my touching him, he immediately arose, purred loudly, rubbed against my hand, and appeared delighted with my notice. 1282973|0|15|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10055|This, then, was the very creature of which I was in search. 1283094|1|15|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10056|I at once offered to purchase it of the landlord; but this person made no claim to it --knew nothing of it --had never seen it before. 1283153|2|15|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10057|I continued my caresses, and, when I prepared to go home, the animal evinced a disposition to accompany me. 1283287|0|16|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10058|I permitted it to do so; occasionally stooping and patting it as I proceeded. 1283394|1|16|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10059|When it reached the house it domesticated itself at once, and became immediately a great favorite with my wife. 1283471|2|16|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10060|For my own part, I soon found a dislike to it arising within me. 1283582|0|17|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10061|This was just the reverse of what I had anticipated; but I know not how or why it was --its evident fondness for myself rather disgusted and annoyed. 1283646|1|17|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10062|By slow degrees, these feelings of disgust and annoyance rose into the bitterness of hatred. 1283795|2|17|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10063|I avoided the creature; a certain sense of shame, and the remembrance of my former deed of cruelty, preventing me from physically abusing it. 1283887|3|17|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10064|I did not, for some weeks, strike, or otherwise violently ill use it; but gradually --very gradually --I came to look upon it with unutterable loathing, and to flee silently from its odious presence, as from the breath of a pestilence. 1284028|4|17|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10065|What added, no doubt, to my hatred of the beast, was the discovery, on the morning after I brought it home, that, like Pluto, it also had been deprived of one of its eyes. 1284263|0|18|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10066|This circumstance, however, only endeared it to my wife, who, as I have already said, possessed, in a high degree, that humanity of feeling which had once been my distinguishing trait, and the source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures. 1284434|1|18|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10067|With my aversion to this cat, however, its partiality for myself seemed to increase. 1284678|0|19|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10068|It followed my footsteps with a pertinacity which it would be difficult to make the reader comprehend. 1284762|1|19|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10069|Whenever I sat, it would crouch beneath my chair, or spring upon my knees, covering me with its loathsome caresses. 1284864|2|19|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10070|If I arose to walk it would get between my feet and thus nearly throw me down, or, fastening its long and sharp claws in my dress, clamber, in this manner, to my breast. 1284979|3|19|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10071|At such times, although I longed to destroy it with a blow, I was yet withheld from so doing, partly it at by a memory of my former crime, but chiefly --let me confess it at once --by absolute dread of the beast. 1285148|4|19|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10072|From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my disposition. 1285360|0|2|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10073|My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make me the jest of my companions. 1285436|1|2|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10074|I was especially fond of animals, and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets. 1285523|2|2|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10075|With these I spent most of my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing them. 1285617|3|2|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10076|This peculiar of character grew with my growth, and in my manhood, I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure. 1285711|4|2|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10077|To those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious dog, I need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the gratification thus derivable. 1285836|5|2|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10078|There is something in the unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man. 1286021|6|2|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10079|This dread was not exactly a dread of physical evil-and yet I should be at a loss how otherwise to define it. 1286229|0|20|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10080|I am almost ashamed to own --yes, even in this felon's cell, I am almost ashamed to own --that the terror and horror with which the animal inspired me, had been heightened by one of the merest chimaeras it would be possible to conceive. 1286338|1|20|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10081|My wife had called my attention, more than once, to the character of the mark of white hair, of which I have spoken, and which constituted the sole visible difference between the strange beast and the one I had y si destroyed. 1286574|2|20|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10082|The reader will remember that this mark, although large, had been originally very indefinite; but, by slow degrees --degrees nearly imperceptible, and which for a long time my Reason struggled to reject as fanciful --it had, at length, assumed a rigorous distinctness of outline. 1286800|3|20|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10083|It was now the representation of an object that I shudder to name --and for this, above all, I loathed, and dreaded, and would have rid myself of the monster had I dared --it was now, I say, the image of a hideous --of a ghastly thing --of the GALLOWS! 1287079|4|20|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10084|--oh, mournful and terrible engine of Horror and of Crime --of Agony and of Death! 1287331|5|20|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10085|And now was I indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere Humanity. 1287413|0|21|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10086|And a brute beast --whose fellow I had contemptuously destroyed --a brute beast to work out for me --for me a man, fashioned in the image of the High God --so much of insufferable wo! 1287484|1|21|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10087|Alas! 1287667|2|21|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10088|neither by day nor by night knew I the blessing of Rest any more! 1287672|3|21|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10089|During the former the creature left me no moment alone; and, in the latter, I started, hourly, from dreams of unutterable fear, to find the hot breath of the thing upon my face, and its vast weight --an incarnate Night-Mare that I had no power to shake off --incumbent eternally upon my heart! 1287737|4|21|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10090|Beneath the pressure of torments such as these, the feeble remnant of the good within me succumbed. 1288030|0|22|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10091|Evil thoughts became my sole intimates --the darkest and most evil of thoughts. 1288129|1|22|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10092|The moodiness of my usual temper increased to hatred of all things and of all mankind; while, from the sudden, frequent, and ungovernable outbursts of a fury to which I now blindly abandoned myself, my uncomplaining wife, alas! 1288208|2|22|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10093|was the most usual and the most patient of sufferers. 1288435|3|22|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10094|One day she accompanied me, upon some household errand, into the cellar of the old building which our poverty compelled us to inhabit. 1288488|0|23|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10095|The cat followed me down the steep stairs, and, nearly throwing me headlong, exasperated me to madness. 1288622|1|23|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10096|Uplifting an axe, and forgetting, in my wrath, the childish dread which had hitherto stayed my hand, I aimed a blow at the animal which, of course, would have proved instantly fatal had it descended as I wished. 1288725|2|23|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10097|But this blow was arrested by the hand of my wife. 1288936|3|23|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10098|Goaded, by the interference, into a rage more than demoniacal, I withdrew my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain. 1288986|4|23|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10099|She fell dead upon the spot, without a groan. 1289114|5|23|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10100|This hideous murder accomplished, I set myself forthwith, and with entire deliberation, to the task of concealing the body. 1289159|0|24|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10101|I knew that I could not remove it from the house, either by day or by night, without the risk of being observed by the neighbors. 1289282|1|24|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10102|Many projects entered my mind. 1289411|2|24|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10103|At one period I thought of cutting the corpse into minute fragments, and destroying them by fire. 1289441|3|24|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10104|At another, I resolved to dig a grave for it in the floor of the cellar. 1289538|4|24|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10105|Again, I deliberated about casting it in the well in the yard --about packing it in a box, as if merchandize, with the usual arrangements, and so getting a porter to take it from the house. 1289610|5|24|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10106|Finally I hit upon what I considered a far better expedient than either of these. 1289799|6|24|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10107|I determined to wall it up in the cellar --as the monks of the middle ages are recorded to have walled up their victims. 1289880|7|24|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10108|For a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted. 1290000|0|25|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10109|Its walls were loosely constructed, and had lately been plastered throughout with a rough plaster, which the dampness of the atmosphere had prevented from hardening. 1290055|1|25|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10110|Moreover, in one of the walls was a projection, caused by a false chimney, or fireplace, that had been filled up, and made to resemble the rest of the cellar. 1290220|2|25|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10111|I made no doubt that I could readily displace the at this point, insert the corpse, and wall the whole up as before, so that no eye could detect anything suspicious. 1290378|3|25|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10112|And in this calculation I was not deceived. 1290543|0|26|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10113|By means of a crow-bar I easily dislodged the bricks, and, having carefully deposited the body against the inner wall, I propped it in that position, while, with little trouble, I re-laid the whole structure as it originally stood. 1290586|1|26|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10114|Having procured mortar, sand, and hair, with every possible precaution, I prepared a plaster could not every poss be distinguished from the old, and with this I very carefully went over the new brick-work. 1290817|2|26|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10115|When I had finished, I felt satisfied that all was right. 1291022|3|26|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10116|The wall did not present the slightest appearance of having been disturbed. 1291079|4|26|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10117|The rubbish on the floor was picked up with the minutest care. 1291154|5|26|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10118|"I looked around triumphantly, and said to myself --""Here at least, then, my labor has not been in vain"". 1291216"|6|26|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10119|My next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause of so much wretchedness; for I had, at length, firmly resolved to put it to death. 1291320|0|27|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10120|Had I been able to meet with it, at the moment, there could have been no doubt of its fate; but it appeared that the crafty animal had been alarmed at the violence of my previous anger, and forebore to present itself in my present mood. 1291466|1|27|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10121|It is impossible to describe, or to imagine, the deep, the blissful sense of relief which the absence of the detested creature occasioned in my bosom. 1291702|2|27|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10122|It did not make its appearance during the night --and thus for one night at least, since its introduction into the house, I soundly and tranquilly slept; aye, slept even with the burden of murder upon my soul! 1291852|3|27|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10123|The second and the third day passed, and still my tormentor came not. 1292061|0|28|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10124|Once again I breathed as a free-man. 1292130|1|28|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10125|The monster, in terror, had fled the premises forever! 1292166|2|28|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10126|I should behold it no more! 1292220|3|28|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10127|My happiness was supreme! 1292247|4|28|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10128|The guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but little. 1292272|5|28|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10129|Some few inquiries had been made, but these had been readily answered. 1292322|6|28|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10130|Even a search had been instituted --but of course nothing was to be discovered. 1292392|7|28|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10131|I looked upon my future felicity as secured. 1292471|8|28|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10132|Upon the fourth day of the assassination, a party of the police came, very unexpectedly, into the house, and proceeded again to make rigorous investigation of the premises. 1292515|0|29|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10133|Secure, however, in the inscrutability of my place of concealment, I felt no embarrassment whatever. 1292687|1|29|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10134|The glee at my heart was too strong to be restrained. 1292787|10|29|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10135|I burned to say if but one word, by way of triumph, and to render doubly sure their assurance of my guiltlessness. 1292840|11|29|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10136|The officers bade me accompany them in their search. 1292954|2|29|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10137|They left no nook or corner unexplored. 1293006|3|29|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10138|At length, for the third or fourth time, they descended into the cellar. 1293045|4|29|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10139|I quivered not in a muscle. 1293117|5|29|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10140|My heart beat calmly as that of one who slumbers in innocence. 1293144|6|29|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10141|I walked the cellar from end to end. 1293206|7|29|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10142|I folded my arms upon my bosom, and roamed easily to and fro. 1293242|8|29|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10143|The police were thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart. 1293303|9|29|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10144|I married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not uncongenial with my own. 1293363|0|3|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10145|Observing my partiality for domestic pets, she lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind. 1293455|1|3|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10146|We had birds, gold fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey, and a cat. 1293568|2|3|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10147|"""Gentlemen,"" I said at last, as the party ascended the steps, ""I delight to have allayed your suspicions. 1293640"|0|30|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10148|I wish you all health, and a little more courtesy. 1293745|1|30|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10149|"By the bye, gentlemen, this --this is a very well constructed house"". 1293795"|2|30|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10150|(In the rabid desire to say something easily, I scarcely knew what I uttered at all. 1293864|3|30|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10151|") --""I may say an excellently well constructed house. 1293948"|4|30|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10152|These walls --are you going, gentlemen? 1294001|5|30|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10153|"--these walls are solidly put together""; and here, through the mere phrenzy of bravado, I rapped heavily, with a cane which I held in my hand, upon that very portion of the brick-work behind which stood the corpse of the wife of my bosom. 1294040"|6|30|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10154|But may God shield and deliver me from the fangs of the Arch-Fiend! 1294278|0|31|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10155|No sooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into silence than I was answered by a voice from within the tomb! 1294345|1|31|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10156|--by a cry, at first muffled and broken, like the sobbing of a child, and then quickly swelling into one long, loud, and continuous scream, utterly anomalous and inhuman --a howl --a wailing shriek, half of horror and half of triumph, such as might have arisen only out of hell, conjointly from the throats of the damned in their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation. 1294459|2|31|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10157|Of my own thoughts it is folly to speak. 1294841|0|32|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10158|Swooning, I staggered to the opposite wall. 1294881|1|32|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10159|For one instant the party upon the stairs remained motionless, through extremity of terror and of awe. 1294924|2|32|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10160|In the next, a dozen stout arms were tolling at the wall. 1295026|3|32|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10161|It fell bodily. 1295083|4|32|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10162|The corpse, already greatly decayed and clotted with gore, stood erect before the eyes of the spectators. 1295098|5|32|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10163|Upon its head, with red extended mouth and solitary eye of fire, sat the hideous beast whose craft had seduced me into murder, and whose informing voice had consigned me to the hangman. 1295203|6|32|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10164|I had walled the monster up within the tomb! 1295388|7|32|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10165|This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely black, and sagacious to an astonishing degree. 1295432|0|4|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10166|In speaking of his intelligence, my wife, who at heart was not a little tinctured with superstition, made frequent allusion to the ancient popular notion, which regarded all black cats as witches in disguise. 1295544|1|4|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10167|Not that she was ever serious upon this point --and I mention the matter at all for no better reason than that it happens, just now, to be remembered. 1295752|2|4|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10168|Pluto --this was the cat's name --was my favorite pet and playmate. 1295902|0|5|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10169|I alone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went about the house. 1295969|1|5|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10170|It was even with difficulty that I could prevent him from following me through the streets. 1296037|2|5|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10171|Our friendship lasted, in this manner, for several years, during which my general temperament and character --through the instrumentality of the Fiend Intemperance --had (I blush to confess it) experienced a radical alteration for the worse. 1296128|0|6|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10172|I grew, day by day, more moody, more irritable, more regardless of the feelings of others. 1296369|1|6|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10173|I suffered myself to use intemperate language to my At length, I even offered her personal violence. 1296459|2|6|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10174|My pets, of course, were made to feel the change in my disposition. 1296559|3|6|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10175|I not only neglected, but ill-used them. 1296626|4|6|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10176|For Pluto, however, I still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from maltreating him, as I made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits, the monkey, or even the dog, when by accident, or through affection, they came in my way. 1296666|5|6|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10177|But my disease grew upon me --for what disease is like Alcohol! 1296896|6|6|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10178|--and at length even Pluto, who was now becoming old, and consequently somewhat peevish --even Pluto began to experience the effects of my ill temper. 1296959|7|6|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10179|One night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one of my haunts about town, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence. 1297109|0|7|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10180|I seized him; when, in his fright at my violence, he inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with his teeth. 1297231|1|7|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10181|The fury of a demon instantly possessed me. 1297337|2|7|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10182|I knew myself no longer. 1297380|3|7|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10183|My original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight from my body; and a more than fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled every fibre of my frame. 1297404|4|7|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10184|I took from my waistcoat-pocket a pen-knife, opened it, grasped the poor beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one of its eyes from the socket! 1297556|5|7|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10185|I blush, I burn, I shudder, while I pen the damnable atrocity. 1297703|6|7|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10186|When reason returned with the morning --when I had slept off the fumes of the night's debauch --I experienced a sentiment half of horror, half of remorse, for the crime of which I had been guilty; but it was, at best, a feeble and equivocal feeling, and the soul remained untouched. 1297765|0|8|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10187|I again plunged into excess, and soon drowned in wine all memory of the deed. 1298047|1|8|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10188|In the meantime the cat slowly recovered. 1298124|0|9|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10189|The socket of the lost eye presented, it is true, a frightful appearance, but he no longer appeared to suffer any pain. 1298165|1|9|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10190|This spirit of perverseness, I say, came to my final overthrow. 1298284|10|9|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10191|It was this unfathomable longing of the soul to vex itself --to offer violence to its own nature --to do wrong for the wrong's sake only --that urged me to continue and finally to consummate the injury I had inflicted upon the unoffending brute. 1298347|11|9|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10192|One morning, in cool blood, I slipped a noose about its neck and hung it to the limb of a tree; --hung it with the tears streaming from my eyes, and with the bitterest remorse at my heart; --hung it because I knew that it had loved me, and because I felt it had given me no reason of offence; --hung it because I knew that in so doing I was committing a sin --a deadly sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place it --if such a thing were possible --even beyond the reach of the infinite mercy of the Most Merciful and Most Terrible God. 1298592|12|9|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10193|He went about the house as usual, but, as might be expected, fled in extreme terror at my approach. 1299143|2|9|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10194|I had so much of my old heart left, as to be at first grieved by this evident dislike on the part of a creature which had once so loved me. 1299242|3|9|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10195|But this feeling soon gave place to irritation. 1299381|4|9|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10196|And then came, as if to my final and irrevocable overthrow, the spirit of PERVERSENESS. 1299428|5|9|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10197|Of this spirit philosophy takes no account. 1299515|6|9|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10198|Yet I am not more sure that my soul lives, than I am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the human heart --one of the indivisible primary faculties, or sentiments, which give direction to the character of Man. 1299558|7|9|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10199|Who has not, a hundred times, found himself committing a vile or a silly action, for no other reason than because he knows he should not? 1299785|8|9|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10200|Have we not a perpetual inclination, in the teeth of our best judgment, to violate that which is Law, merely because we understand it to be such? 1299922|9|9|The Black Cat|1843-08-19 00:00:00|['Horror']
10201|Ut canis a corio nunquam absterrebitur uncto. 1300067|0|10|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10202|so he never lets go of his game. 1300112|0|11|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10203|Ingenuity:; Your diddler is ingenious. 1300144|0|12|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10204|He has constructiveness large. 1300182|1|12|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10205|He understands plot. 1300212|2|12|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10206|He invents and circumvents. 1300232|3|12|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10207|Were he not Alexander he would be Diogenes. 1300259|4|12|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10208|Were he not a diddler, he would be a maker of patent rat-traps or an angler for trout. 1300302|5|12|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10209|Audacity:; Your diddler is audacious. 1300388|0|13|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10210|; He is a bold man. 1300425|1|13|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10211|He carries the war into Africa. 1300444|2|13|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10212|He conquers all by assault. 1300475|3|13|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10213|He would not fear the daggers of Frey Herren. 1300502|4|13|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10214|With a little more prudence Dick Turpin would have made a good diddler; with a trifle less blarney, Daniel O'Connell; with a pound or two more brains Charles the Twelfth. 1300547|5|13|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10215|Nonchalance:; Your diddler is nonchalant. 1300717|0|14|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10216|He is not at all nervous. 1300758|1|14|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10217|He never had any nerves. 1300783|2|14|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10218|He is never seduced into a flurry. 1300807|3|14|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10219|He is never put out; unless put out of doors. 1300841|4|14|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10220|He is cool; cool as a cucumber. 1300886|5|14|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10221|"He is calm; ""calm as a smile from Lady Bury"". 1300917"|6|14|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10222|He is easy- easy as an old glove, or the damsels of ancient Baiae. 1300962|7|14|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10223|Originality:; Your diddler is original; conscientiously so. 1301028|0|15|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10224|His thoughts are his own. 1301087|1|15|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10225|He would scorn to employ those of another. 1301112|2|15|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10226|A stale trick is his aversion. 1301154|3|15|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10227|He would return a purse, I am sure, upon discovering that he had obtained it by an unoriginal diddle. 1301184|4|15|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10228|Impertinence. 1301285|0|16|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10229|; Your diddler is impertinent. 1301298|1|16|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10230|He swaggers. 1301328|2|16|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10231|He sets his arms a-kimbo. 1301340|3|16|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10232|He thrusts. 1301365|4|16|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10233|his hands in his trowsers' pockets. 1301376|5|16|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10234|He sneers in your face. 1301411|6|16|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10235|He treads on your corns. 1301434|7|16|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10236|He eats your dinner, he drinks your wine, he borrows your money, he pulls your nose, he kicks your poodle, and he kisses your wife. 1301458|8|16|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10237|Grin:; Your true diddler winds up all with a grin. 1301589|0|17|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10238|But this nobody sees but himself. 1301639|1|17|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10239|This is no hypothesis. 1301672|10|17|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10240|It is a matter of course. 1301694|11|17|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10241|I reason a priori, and a diddle would be no diddle without a grin. 1301719|12|17|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10242|He grins when his daily work is done; when his allotted labors are accomplished; at night in his own closet, and altogether for his own private entertainment. 1301785|2|17|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10243|He goes home. 1301943|3|17|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10244|He locks his door. 1301956|4|17|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10245|He divests himself of his clothes. 1301974|5|17|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10246|He puts out his candle. 1302008|6|17|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10247|He gets into bed. 1302031|7|17|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10248|He places his head upon the pillow. 1302048|8|17|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10249|All this done, and your diddler grins. 1302083|9|17|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10250|The origin of the diddle is referrable to the infancy of the Human Race. 1302121|0|18|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10251|Perhaps the first diddler was Adam. 1302193|1|18|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10252|At all events, we can trace the science back to a very remote period of antiquity. 1302228|2|18|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10253|The moderns, however, have brought it to a perfection never dreamed of by our thick-headed progenitors. 1302310|3|18|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10254|"Without pausing to speak of the ""old saws,"" therefore, I shall content myself with a compendious account of some of the more ""modern instances"". 1302413"|4|18|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10255|A very good diddle is this. 1302557|0|19|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10256|A housekeeper in want of a sofa, for instance, is seen to go in and out of several cabinet warehouses. 1302584|1|19|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10257|No sofa has been sold; no money received; except by the diddler, who played shop-keeper for the nonce. 1302686|10|19|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10258|At length she arrives at one offering an excellent variety. 1302788|2|19|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10259|She is accosted, and invited to enter, by a polite and voluble individual at the door. 1302847|3|19|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10260|She finds a sofa well adapted to her views, and upon inquiring the price, is surprised and delighted to hear a sum named at least twenty per cent. 1302933|4|19|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10261|lower than her expectations. 1303079|5|19|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10262|She hastens to make the purchase, gets a bill and receipt, leaves her address, with a request that the article be sent home as speedily as possible, and retires amid a profusion of bows from the shopkeeper. 1303107|6|19|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10263|The night arrives and no sofa. 1303313|7|19|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10264|A servant is sent to make inquiry about the delay. 1303343|8|19|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10265|The whole transaction is denied. 1303393|9|19|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10266|SINCE the world began there have been two Jeremys. 1303425|0|2|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10267|The one wrote a Jeremiad about usury, and was called Jeremy Bentham. 1303475|1|2|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10268|He has been much admired by Mr. John Neal, and was a great man in a small way. 1303543|2|2|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10269|The other gave name to the most important of the Exact Sciences, and was a great man in a great way; I may say, indeed, in the very greatest of ways. 1303621|3|2|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10270|Our cabinet warehouses are left entirely unattended, and thus afford every facility for a trick of this kind. 1303770|0|20|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10271|Visiters enter, look at furniture, and depart unheeded and unseen. 1303879|1|20|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10272|Should any one wish to purchase, or to inquire the price of an article, a bell is at hand, and this is considered amply sufficient. 1303945|2|20|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10273|Again, quite a respectable diddle is this. 1304076|0|21|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10274|"""My dear sir, never mind; just oblige me, will you, by sending the bundle home? 1304118"|0|22|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10275|But stay! 1304197|1|22|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10276|I really believe that I have nothing less than a five dollar bill, even there. 1304206|2|22|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10277|"However, you can send four dollars in change with the bundle, you know"". 1304284"|3|22|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10278|"""Very good, sir,"" replies the shop-keeper, who entertains, at once, a lofty opinion of the high-mindedness of his customer. 1304356"|0|23|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10279|"""I know fellows,"" he says to himself, ""who would just have put the goods under their arm, and walked off with a promise to call and pay the dollar as they came by in the afternoon"". 1304479"|1|23|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10280|A boy is sent with the parcel and change. 1304660|0|24|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10281|"""Ah! 1304701"|0|25|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10282|This is my bundle, I see; I thought you had been home with it, long ago. 1304705|1|25|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10283|Well, go on! 1304777|2|25|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10284|My wife, Mrs. Trotter, will give you the five dollars; I left instructions with her to that effect. 1304789|3|25|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10285|The change you might as well give to me; I shall want some silver for the Post Office. 1304888|4|25|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10286|Very good! 1304974|5|25|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10287|One, two, is this a good quarter? 1304984|6|25|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10288|- three, four; quite right! 1305017|7|25|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10289|"Say to Mrs. Trotter that you met me, and be sure now and do not loiter on the way"". 1305044"|8|25|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10290|The boy doesn't loiter at all; but he is a very long time in getting back from his errand; for no lady of the precise name of Mrs. Trotter is to be discovered. 1305127|0|26|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10291|He consoles himself, however, that he has not been such a fool as to leave the goods without the money, and re-entering his shop with a self-satisfied air, feels sensibly hurt and indignant when his master asks him what has become of the change. 1305286|1|26|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10292|A very simple diddle, indeed, is this. 1305531|0|27|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10293|The captain of a ship, which is about to sail, is presented by an official looking person with an unusually moderate bill of city charges. 1305569|1|27|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10294|Glad to get off so easily, and confused by a hundred duties pressing upon him all at once, he discharges the claim forthwith. 1305707|2|27|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10295|In about fifteen minutes, another and less reasonable bill is handed him by one who soon makes it evident that the first collector was a diddler, and the original collection a diddle. 1305832|3|27|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10296|And here, too, is a somewhat similar thing. 1306015|0|28|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10297|A steamboat is casting loose from the wharf. 1306058|1|28|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10298|A traveller, portmanteau in hand, is discovered running toward the wharf, at full speed. 1306102|2|28|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10299|Suddenly, he makes a dead halt, stoops, and picks up something from the ground in a very agitated manner. 1306190|3|28|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10300|"It is a pocket-book, and; ""Has any gentleman lost a pocketbook""? 1306295"|4|28|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10301|he cries. 1306359|5|28|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10302|No one can say that he has exactly lost a pocket-book; but a great excitement ensues, when the treasure trove is found to be of value. 1306368|6|28|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10303|The boat, however, must not be detained. 1306502|7|28|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10304|"""Time and tide wait for no man,"" says the captain. 1306542"|0|29|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10305|Diddling; or the abstract idea conveyed by the verb to diddle; is sufficiently well understood. 1306592|0|3|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10306|Yet the fact, the deed, the thing diddling, is somewhat difficult to define. 1306687|1|3|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10307|We may get, however, at a tolerably distinct conception of the matter in hand, by defining- not the thing, diddling, in itself; but man, as an animal that diddles. 1306763|2|3|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10308|Had Plato but hit upon this, he would have been spared the affront of the picked chicken. 1306926|3|3|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10309|"""For God's sake, stay only a few minutes,"" says the finder of the book; ""the true claimant will presently appear"". 1307015"|0|30|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10310|"""Can't wait""! 1307129"|0|31|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10311|"replies the man in authority; ""cast off there, d'ye hear""? 1307142"|1|31|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10312|"""What am I to do""? 1307200"|0|32|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10313|asks the finder, in great tribulation. 1307218|1|32|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10314|"""I am about to leave the country for some years, and I cannot conscientiously retain this large amount in my possession. 1307256"|2|32|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10315|"I beg your pardon, sir,"" [here he addresses a gentleman on shore,] ""but you have the air of an honest man. 1307376"|3|32|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10316|Will you confer upon me the favor of taking charge of this pocket-book; I know I can trust you; and of advertising it? 1307482|4|32|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10317|The notes, you see, amount to a very considerable sum. 1307600|5|32|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10318|"""Me! 1307654"|0|33|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10319|; no, you! 1307658|1|33|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10320|"; it was you who found the book"". 1307668"|2|33|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10321|"""Well, if you must have it so; I will take a small reward; just to satisfy your scruples. 1307701"|0|34|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10322|Let me see; why these notes are all hundreds- bless my soul! 1307790|1|34|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10323|"""Cast off there""! 1307850"|0|35|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10324|says the captain. 1307867|1|35|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10325|"""Cast off there""! 1307884"|0|37|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10326|says the captain. 1307901|1|37|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10327|"""Never mind""! 1307918"|0|38|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10328|"cries the gentleman on shore, who has been examining his own pocket-book for the last minute or so; ""never mind! 1307931"|1|38|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10329|"I can fix it; here is a fifty on the Bank of North America; throw the book"". 1308043"|2|38|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10330|And the over-conscientious finder takes the fifty with marked reluctance, and throws the gentleman the book, as desired, while the steamboat fumes and fizzes on her way. 1308119|0|39|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10331|"In about half an hour after her departure, the ""large amount"" is seen to be a ""counterfeit presentment,"" and the whole thing a capital diddle. 1308288"|1|39|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10332|"Very pertinently it was demanded of Plato, why a picked chicken, which was clearly ""a biped without feathers,"" was not, according to his own definition, a man? 1308430"|0|4|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10333|But I am not to be bothered by any similar query. 1308589|1|4|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10334|Man is an animal that diddles, and there is no animal that diddles but man. 1308638|2|4|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10335|It will take an entire hen-coop of picked chickens to get over that. 1308713|3|4|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10336|A bold diddle is this. 1308781|0|40|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10337|A camp-meeting, or something similar, is to be held at a certain spot which is accessible only by means of a free bridge. 1308803|1|40|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10338|A diddler stations himself upon this bridge, respectfully informs all passers by of the new county law, which establishes a toll of one cent for foot passengers, two for horses and donkeys, and so forth, and so forth. 1308924|2|40|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10339|Some grumble but all submit, and the diddler goes home a wealthier man by some fifty or sixty dollars well earned. 1309141|3|40|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10340|This taking a toll from a great crowd of people is an excessively troublesome thing. 1309255|4|40|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10341|A neat diddle is this. 1309339|0|41|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10342|A friend holds one of the diddler's promises to pay, filled up and signed in due form, upon the ordinary blanks printed in red ink. 1309361|1|41|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10343|The diddler purchases one or two dozen of these blanks, and every day dips one of them in his soup, makes his dog jump for it, and finally gives it to him as a bonne bouche. 1309492|2|41|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10344|The note arriving at maturity, the diddler, with the diddler's dog, calls upon the friend, and the promise to pay is made the topic of discussion. 1309665|3|41|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10345|The friend produces it from his escritoire, and is in the act of reaching it to the diddler, when up jumps the diddler's dog and devours it forthwith. 1309811|4|41|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10346|The diddler is not only surprised but vexed and incensed at the absurd behavior of his dog, and expresses his entire readiness to cancel the obligation at any moment when the evidence of the obligation shall be forthcoming. 1309961|5|41|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10347|A very mean diddle is this. 1310184|0|42|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10348|A lady is insulted in the street by a diddler's accomplice. 1310211|1|42|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10349|The diddler himself flies to her assistance, and, giving his friend a comfortable thrashing, insists upon attending the lady to her own door. 1310270|2|42|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10350|He bows, with his hand upon his heart, and most respectfully bids her adieu. 1310411|3|42|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10351|She entreats him, as her deliverer, to walk in and be introduced to her big brother and her papa. 1310487|4|42|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10352|With a sigh, he declines to do so. 1310584|5|42|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10353|"""Is there no way, then, sir,"" she murmurs, ""in which I may be permitted to testify my gratitude""? 1310618"|6|42|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10354|"""Why, yes, madam, there is. 1310715"|0|43|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10355|"Will you be kind enough to lend me a couple of shillings""? 1310742"|1|43|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10356|In the first excitement of the moment the lady decides upon fainting outright. 1310800|0|44|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10357|Upon second thought, however, she opens her purse-strings and delivers the specie. 1310878|1|44|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10358|Now this, I say, is a diddle minute; for one entire moiety of the sum borrowed has to be paid to the gentleman who had the trouble of performing the insult, and who had then to stand still and be thrashed for performing it. 1310960|2|44|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10359|Rather a small but still a scientific diddle is this. 1311183|0|45|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10360|The diddler approaches the bar of a tavern, and demands a couple of twists of tobacco. 1311236|1|45|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10361|"""I don't much like this tobacco. 1311322"|0|46|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10362|"Here, take it back, and give me a glass of brandy and water in its place"". 1311354"|1|46|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10363|The brandy and water is furnished and imbibed, and the diddler makes his way to the door. 1311428|2|46|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10364|But the voice of the tavern-keeper arrests him. 1311517|3|46|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10365|"""I believe, sir, you have forgotten to pay for your brandy and water"". 1311564"|0|47|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10366|"""Pay for my brandy and water! 1311634"|0|48|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10367|; didn't I give you the tobacco for the brandy and water? 1311663|1|48|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10368|"What more would you have""? 1311720"|2|48|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10369|"""But, sir, if you please, I don't remember that you paid me for the tobacco"". 1311746"|0|49|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10370|What constitutes the essence, the nare, the principle of diddling is, in fact, peculiar to the class of creatures that wear coats and pantaloons. 1311823|0|5|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10371|A crow thieves; a fox cheats; a weasel outwits; a man diddles. 1311968|1|5|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10372|To diddle is his destiny. 1312030|2|5|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10373|"""Man was made to mourn,"" says the poet. 1312055"|3|5|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10374|But not so:; he was made to diddle. 1312094|4|5|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10375|This is his aim; his object- his end. 1312129|5|5|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10376|"And for this reason when a man's diddled we say he's ""done"". 1312166"|6|5|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10377|"""What do you mean by that, you scoundrel? 1312226"|0|50|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10378|; Didn't I give you back your tobacco? 1312267|1|50|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10379|Isn't that your tobacco lying there? 1312305|2|50|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10380|"Do you expect me to pay for what I did not take""? 1312341"|3|50|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10381|"""But me no buts, sir,"" interrupts the diddler, apparently in very high dudgeon, and slamming the door after him, as he makes his escape. 1312390"|0|52|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10382|"; ""But me no buts, sir, and none of your tricks upon travellers"". 1312526"|1|52|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10383|Here again is a very clever diddle, of which the simplicity is not its least recommendation. 1312591|0|53|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10384|A purse, or pocket-book, being really lost, the loser inserts in one of the daily papers of a large city a fully descriptive advertisement. 1312683|1|53|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10385|Whereupon our diddler copies the facts of this advertisement, with a change of heading, of general phraseology and address. 1312822|0|54|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10386|"The original, for instance, is long, and verbose, is headed ""A Pocket-Book Lost""! 1312945"|1|54|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10387|The former pays the reward, pockets the treasure and decamps. 1313026|10|54|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10388|and requires the treasure, when found, to be left at No. 1313087|2|54|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10389|1 Tom Street. 1313143|3|54|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10390|"The copy is brief, and being headed with ""Lost"" only, indicates No. 1313156"|4|54|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10391|2 Dick, or No. 1313223|5|54|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10392|3 Harry Street, as the locality at which the owner may be seen. 1313237|6|54|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10393|Moreover, it is inserted in at least five or six of the daily papers of the day, while in point of time, it makes its appearance only a few hours after the original. 1313300|7|54|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10394|Should it be read by the loser of the purse, he would hardly suspect it to have any reference to his own misfortune. 1313465|8|54|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10395|But, of course, the chances are five or six to one, that the finder will repair to the address given by the diddler, rather than to that pointed out by the rightful proprietor. 1313581|9|54|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10396|Quite an analogous diddle is this. 1313757|0|55|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']
10397|A lady of ton has dropped, some where in the street, a diamond ring of very unusual value. 1313791|1|55|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']

10421|Terms, however, are no object; only he must insist upon settling his bill on the first of every month, (it is now the second) and begs his landlady, when he finally obtains one to his mind, not on any account to forget his instructions upon this point; but to send in a bill, and receipt, precisely at ten o'clock, on the first day of every month, and under no circumstances to put it off to the second. 1316651|4|57|Diddling|1843-10-14 00:00:00|['Parody']

10497|The great error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure algebra, are abstract or general truths. 1327934|3|104|The Purloined Letter|1844-01-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
10498|And this error is so egregious that I am confounded at the universality with which it has been received. 1328052|4|104|The Purloined Letter|1844-01-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

10512|His frequent absences from home at night, which were hailed by the Prefect as certain aids to his success, I regarded only as ruses, to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police, and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which G--, in fact, did finally arrive --the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises. 1329705|6|105|The Purloined Letter|1844-01-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
10513|I felt, also, that the whole train of thought, which I was at some pains in detailing to you just now, concerning the invariable principle of policial action in searches for articles concealed --I felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the Minister. 1330052|7|105|The Purloined Letter|1844-01-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
10514|It would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks of concealment. 1330343|8|105|The Purloined Letter|1844-01-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
10515|He could not, I reflected, be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes, to the gimlets, and to the microscopes of the Prefect. 1330423|9|105|The Purloined Letter|1844-01-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

10520|It is not more true in the former, that a large body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one, and that its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty, than it is, in the latter, that intellects of the vaster capacity, while more forcible, more constant, and more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade, are yet the less readily moved, and more embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress. 1331119|2|107|The Purloined Letter|1844-01-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

10525|A novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names; but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large characters, from one end of the chart to the other. 1331995|2|109|The Purloined Letter|1844-01-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
10526|These, like the over-largely lettered signs and placards of the street, escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably self-evident. 1332213|3|109|The Purloined Letter|1844-01-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

10867|Do you not see he has taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter, --not exactly in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg --but, at least, in some hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg? 1370522|7|98|The Purloined Letter|1844-01-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
10868|And do you not see also, that such recherches nooks for concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions, and would be adopted only by ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of concealment, a disposal of the article concealed --a disposal of it in this recherche manner, --is, in the very first instance, presumable and presumed; and thus its discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether upon the mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers; and where the case is of importance --or, what amounts to the same thing in the policial eyes, when the reward is of magnitude, --the qualities in question have never been known to fall. 1370819|8|98|The Purloined Letter|1844-01-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']
10869|You will now understand what I meant in suggesting that, had the purloined letter been hidden anywhere within the limits of the Prefect's examination --in other words, had the principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of the Prefect --its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question. 1371477|9|98|The Purloined Letter|1844-01-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction']

11009|My own name, though, as I say, became Simpson, by act of Legislature, and with so much repugnance on my part, that, at one period, I actually hesitated about accepting the legacy with the useless and annoying proviso attached. 1385958|8|2|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']

11014|In this latter respect I was forced to take Talbot's advice; for he remained obstinately deaf to every further question or suggestion, and occupied himself exclusively for the rest of the evening with what was transacting upon the stage. 1386369|0|24|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11015|In the meantime I kept my eyes riveted on Madame Lalande, and at length had the good fortune to obtain a full front view of her face. 1386606|0|25|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11016|It was exquisitely lovely–this, of course, my heart had told me before, even had not Talbot fully satisfied me upon the point–but still the unintelligible something disturbed me. 1386739|1|25|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11017|I finally concluded that my senses were impressed by a certain air of gravity, sadness, or, still more properly, of weariness, which took something from the youth and freshness of the countenance, only to endow it with a seraphic tenderness and majesty, and thus, of course, to my enthusiastic and romantic temperment, with an interest tenfold. 1386917|2|25|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11018|While I thus feasted my eyes, I perceived, at last, to my great trepidation, by an almost imperceptible start on the part of the lady, that she had become suddenly aware of the intensity of my gaze. 1387261|0|26|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11019|Still, I was absolutely fascinated, and could not withdraw it, even for an instant. 1387459|1|26|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11020|She turned aside her face, and again I saw only the chiselled contour of the back portion of the head. 1387542|2|26|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11021|After some minutes, as if urged by curiosity to see if I was still looking, she gradually brought her face again around and again encountered my burning gaze. 1387644|3|26|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11022|Her large dark eyes fell instantly, and a deep blush mantled her cheek. 1387802|4|26|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11023|But what was my astonishment at perceiving that she not only did not a second time avert her head, but that she actually took from her girdle a double eyeglass–elevated it–adjusted it–and then regarded me through it, intently and deliberately, for the space of several minutes. 1387873|5|26|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11024|Had a thunderbolt fAllan at my feet I could not have been more thoroughly astounded–astounded only–not offended or disgusted in the slightest degree; although an action so bold in any other woman would have been likely to offend or disgust. 1388150|0|27|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11025|But the whole thing was done with so much quietude–so much nonchalance–so much repose- with so evident an air of the highest breeding, in short–that nothing of mere effrontery was perceptible, and my sole sentiments were those of admiration and surprise. 1388390|1|27|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11026|I observed that, upon her first elevation of the glass, she had seemed satisfied with a momentary inspection of my person, and was withdrawing the instrument, when, as if struck by a second thought, she resumed it, and so continued to regard me with fixed attention for the space of several minutes–for five minutes, at the very least, I am sure. 1388644|0|28|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11027|This action, so remarkable in an American theatre, attracted very general observation, and gave rise to an indefinite movement, or buzz, among the audience, which for a moment filled me with confusion, but produced no visible effect upon the countenance of Madame Lalande. 1388990|0|29|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11028|As to personal endowments, I am by no means deficient. 1389262|0|3|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11029|On the contrary, I believe that I am well made, and possess what nine tenths of the world would call a handsome face. 1389316|1|3|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11030|I have hitherto managed as well as I could without either. 1389433|10|3|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11031|But something too much of these merely personal details, which, after all, are of little importance. 1389491|11|3|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11032|I will content myself with saying, in addition, that my temperament is sanguine, rash, ardent, enthusiastic–and that all my life I have been a devoted admirer of the women. 1389591|12|3|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11033|In height I am five feet eleven. 1389763|2|3|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11034|My hair is black and curling. 1389795|3|3|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11035|My nose is sufficiently good. 1389824|4|3|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11036|My eyes are large and gray; and although, in fact they are weak a very inconvenient degree, still no defect in this regard would be suspected from their appearance. 1389853|5|3|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11037|The weakness itself, however, has always much annoyed me, and I have resorted to every remedy–short of wearing glasses. 1390017|6|3|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11038|Being youthful and good-looking, I naturally dislike these, and have resolutely refused to employ them. 1390136|7|3|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11039|I know nothing, indeed, which so disfigures the countenance of a young person, or so impresses every feature with an air of demureness, if not altogether of sanctimoniousness and of age. 1390239|8|3|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11040|An eyeglass, on the other hand, has a savor of downright foppery and affectation. 1390425|9|3|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11041|Having satisfied her curiosity–if such it was–she dropped the glass, and quietly gave her attention again to the stage; her profile now being turned toward myself, as before. 1390506|0|30|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11042|I continued to watch her unremittingly, although I was fully conscious of my rudeness in so doing. 1390680|1|30|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11043|Presently I saw the head slowly and slightly change its position; and soon I became convinced that the lady, while pretending to look at the stage was, in fact, attentively regarding myself. 1390778|2|30|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11044|It is needless to say what effect this conduct, on the part of so fascinating a woman, had upon my excitable mind. 1390968|3|30|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11045|Having thus scrutinized me for perhaps a quarter of an hour, the fair object of my passion addressed the gentleman who attended her, and while she spoke, I saw distinctly, by the glances of both, that the conversation had reference to myself. 1391082|0|31|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11046|Upon its conclusion, Madame Lalande again turned toward the stage, and, for a few minutes, seemed absorbed in the performance. 1391324|0|32|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11047|At the expiration of this period, however, I was thrown into an extremity of agitation by seeing her unfold, for the second time, the eye-glass which hung at her side, fully confront me as before, and, disregarding the renewed buzz of the audience, survey me, from head to foot, with the same miraculous composure which had previously so delighted and confounded my soul. 1391450|1|32|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11048|This extraordinary behavior, by throwing me into a perfect fever of excitement–into an absolute delirium of love-served rather to embolden than to disconcert me. 1391821|0|33|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11049|In the mad intensity of my devotion, I forgot everything but the presence and the majestic loveliness of the vision which confronted my gaze. 1391982|1|33|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11050|Watching my opportunity, when I thought the audience were fully engaged with the opera, I at length caught the eyes of Madame Lalande, and, upon the instant, made a slight but unmistakable bow. 1392123|2|33|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11051|She blushed very deeply–then averted her eyes–then slowly and cautiously looked around, apparently to see if my rash action had been noticed–then leaned over toward the gentleman who sat by her side. 1392316|0|34|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11052|I now felt a burning sense of the impropriety I had committed, and expected nothing less than instant exposure; while a vision of pistols upon the morrow floated rapidly and uncomfortably through my brain. 1392515|0|35|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11053|I was greatly and immediately relieved, however, when I saw the lady merely hand the gentleman a play-bill, without speaking, but the reader may form some feeble conception of my astonishment–of my profound amazement–my delirious bewilderment of heart and soul–when, instantly afterward, having again glanced furtively around, she allowed her bright eyes to set fully and steadily upon my own, and then, with a faint smile, disclosing a bright line of her pearly teeth, made two distinct, pointed, and unequivocal affirmative inclinations of the head. 1392720|1|35|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11054|It is useless, of course, to dwell upon my joy–upon my transport- upon my illimitable ecstasy of heart. 1393271|0|36|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11055|If ever man was mad with excess of happiness, it was myself at that moment. 1393374|1|36|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11056|I loved. 1393449|2|36|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11057|This was my first love–so I felt it to be. 1393457|3|36|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11058|It was love supreme-indescribable. 1393499|4|36|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11059|"It was ""love at first sight;"" and at first sight, too, it had been appreciated and returned. 1393533"|5|36|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11060|Yes, returned. 1393625|0|37|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11061|How and why should I doubt it for an instant. 1393639|1|37|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11062|What other construction could I possibly put upon such conduct, on the part of a lady so beautiful–so wealthy–evidently so accomplished–of so high breeding–of so lofty a position in society–in every regard so entirely respectable as I felt assured was Madame Lalande? 1393684|2|37|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11063|Yes, she loved me–she returned the enthusiasm of my love, with an enthusiasm as blind–as uncompromising–as uncalculating–as abandoned–and as utterly unbounded as my own! 1393951|3|37|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11064|These delicious fancies and reflections, however, were now interrupted by the falling of the drop-curtain. 1394120|4|37|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11065|The audience arose; and the usual tumult immediately supervened. 1394226|5|37|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11066|Quitting Talbot abruptly, I made every effort to force my way into closer proximity with Madame Lalande. 1394290|6|37|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11067|Having failed in this, on account of the crowd, I at length gave up the chase, and bent my steps homeward; consoling myself for my disappointment in not having been able to touch even the hem of her robe, by the reflection that I should be introduced by Talbot, in due form, upon the morrow. 1394394|7|37|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11068|"This morrow at last came, that is to say, a day finally dawned upon a long and weary night of impatience; and then the hours until ""one"" were snail-paced, dreary, and innumerable. 1394685"|0|38|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']

11070|The clock struck. 1394955|2|38|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11071|As the last echo ceased, I stepped into B--'s and inquired for Talbot. 1394972|3|38|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']

11074|It was an opera night, and the bills presented a very rare attraction, so that the house was excessively crowded. 1395173|1|4|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11075|We were in time, however, to obtain the front seats which had been reserved for us, and into which, with some little difficulty, we elbowed our way. 1395286|2|4|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']

11082|I endeavored to reply, but my tongue refused its office. 1395823|1|42|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11083|At length I turned on my heel, livid with wrath, and inwardly consigning the whole tribe of the Talbots to the innermost regions of Erebus. 1395879|2|42|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11084|It was evident that my considerate friend, il fanatico, had quite forgotten his appointment with myself–had forgotten it as soon as it was made. 1396018|3|42|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11085|At no time was he a very scrupulous man of his word. 1396162|4|42|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11086|There was no help for it; so smothering my vexation as well as I could, I strolled moodily up the street, propounding futile inquiries about Madame Lalande to every male acquaintance I met. 1396214|5|42|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11087|By report she was known, I found, to all- to many by sight–but she had been in town only a few weeks, and there were very few, therefore, who claimed her personal acquaintance. 1396403|6|42|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']

11105|For two hours my companion, who was a musical fanatico, gave his undivided attention to the stage; and, in the meantime, I amused myself by observing the audience, which consisted, in chief part, of the very elite of the city. 1397658|0|5|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']

11113|As the carriage of Madame Lalande rolled by our group, I had observed that she recognized me; and more than this, she had blessed me, by the most seraphic of all imaginable smiles, with no equivocal mark of the recognition. 1398336|1|53|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11114|As for an introduction, I was obliged to abandon all hope of it until such time as Talbot should think proper to return from the country. 1398559|0|54|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11115|In the meantime I perseveringly frequented every reputable place of public amusement; and, at length, at the theatre, where I first saw her, I had the supreme bliss of meeting her, and of exchanging glances with her once again. 1398696|1|54|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11116|This did not occur, however, until the lapse of a fortnight. 1398923|2|54|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11117|"Every day, in the interim, I had inquired for Talbot at his hotel, and every day had been thrown into a spasm of wrath by the everlasting ""Not come home yet"" of his footman. 1398983"|3|54|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11118|Upon the evening in question, therefore, I was in a condition little short of madness. 1399156|0|55|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11119|Madame Lalande, I had been told, was a Parisian–had lately arrived from Paris–might she not suddenly return? 1399242|1|55|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11120|–return before Talbot came back–and might she not be thus lost to me forever? 1399350|2|55|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11121|The thought was too terrible to bear. 1399427|3|55|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11122|Since my future happiness was at issue, I resolved to act with a manly decision. 1399464|4|55|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11123|In a word, upon the breaking up of the play, I traced the lady to her residence, noted the address, and the next morning sent her a full and elaborate letter, in which I poured out my whole heart. 1399544|5|55|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11124|I spoke boldly, freely–in a word, I spoke with passion. 1399740|0|56|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11125|I concealed nothing–nothing even of my weakness. 1399795|1|56|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11126|I alluded to the romantic circumstances of our first meeting–even to the glances which had passed between us. 1399843|2|56|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11127|I went so far as to say that I felt assured of her love; while I offered this assurance, and my own intensity of devotion, as two excuses for my otherwise unpardonable conduct. 1399952|3|56|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11128|As a third, I spoke of my fear that she might quit the city before I could have the opportunity of a formal introduction. 1400128|4|56|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11129|I concluded the most wildly enthusiastic epistle ever penned, with a frank declaration of my worldly circumstances–of my affluence–and with an offer of my heart and of my hand. 1400249|5|56|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11130|In an agony of expectation I awaited the reply. 1400425|0|57|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11131|After what seemed the lapse of a century it came. 1400472|1|57|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11132|Yes, actually came. 1400521|0|58|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11133|Romantic as all this may appear, I really received a letter from Madame Lalande–the beautiful, the wealthy, the idolized Madame Lalande. 1400540|1|58|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11134|Her eyes–her magnificent eyes, had not belied her noble heart. 1400676|2|58|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11135|Like a true Frenchwoman as she was she had obeyed the frank dictates of her reason–the generous impulses of her nature–despising the conventional pruderies of the world. 1400738|3|58|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11136|She had not scorned my proposals. 1400907|4|58|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11137|She had not sheltered herself in silence. 1400940|5|58|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11138|She had not returned my letter unopened. 1400981|6|58|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11139|She had even sent me, in reply, one penned by her own exquisite fingers. 1401021|7|58|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']

11152|Still Talbot would not return. 1402036|1|62|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11153|if he could not come himself, why, in the name of every thing rational, could he not have enclosed me a letter of presentation? 1402066|10|62|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11154|I wrote him again, entreating him to forward one forthwith. 1402193|11|62|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']

11156|Alas! 1402333|2|62|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']

11158|Still, however, he came not. 1402507|4|62|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11159|I wrote. 1402535|5|62|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11160|He replied. 1402543|6|62|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11161|He was detained by urgent business–but would shortly return. 1402554|7|62|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']

11167|But I had yet a resource left, in my constitutional audacity. 1403158|0|67|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11168|Hitherto it had served me well, and I now resolved to make it avail me to the end. 1403219|1|67|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11169|Besides, after the correspondence which had passed between us, what act of mere informality could I commit, within bounds, that ought to be regarded as indecorous by Madame Lalande? 1403301|2|67|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11170|Since the affair of the letter, I had been in the habit of watching her house, and thus discovered that, about twilight, it was her custom to promenade, attended only by a negro in livery, in a public square overlooked by her windows. 1403482|3|67|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11171|Here, amid the luxuriant and shadowing groves, in the gray gloom of a sweet midsummer evening, I observed my opportunity and accosted her. 1403716|4|67|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11172|The better to deceive the servant in attendance, I did this with the assured air of an old and familiar acquaintance. 1403854|0|68|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11173|With a presence of mind truly Parisian, she took the cue at once, and, to greet me, held out the most bewitchingly little of hands. 1403971|1|68|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11174|The valet at once fell into the rear, and now, with hearts full to overflowing, we discoursed long and unreservedly of our love. 1404102|2|68|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11175|As Madame Lalande spoke English even less fluently than she wrote it, our conversation was necessarily in French. 1404230|0|69|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11176|In this sweet tongue, so adapted to passion, I gave loose to the impetuous enthusiasm of my nature, and, with all the eloquence I could command, besought her to consent to an immediate marriage. 1404343|1|69|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11177|The magic of a lovely form in woman–the necromancy of female gracefulness–was always a power which I had found it impossible to resist, but here was grace personified, incarnate, the beau ideal of my wildest and most enthusiastic visions. 1404537|0|7|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11178|The figure, almost all of which the construction of the box permitted to be seen, was somewhat above the medium height, and nearly approached, without positively reaching, the majestic. 1404775|1|7|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11179|Its perfect fullness and tournure were delicious. 1404960|2|7|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11180|The head of which only the back was visible, rivalled in outline that of the Greek Psyche, and was rather displayed than concealed by an elegant cap of gaze aerienne, which put me in mind of the ventum textilem of Apuleius. 1405009|3|7|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11181|The right arm hung over the balustrade of the box, and thrilled every nerve of my frame with its exquisite symmetry. 1405232|4|7|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11182|Its upper portion was draperied by one of the loose open sleeves now in fashion. 1405348|5|7|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11183|This extended but little below the elbow. 1405428|6|7|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11184|Beneath it was worn an under one of some frail material, close-fitting, and terminated by a cuff of rich lace, which fell gracefully over the top of the hand, revealing only the delicate fingers, upon one of which sparkled a diamond ring, which I at once saw was of extraordinary value. 1405469|7|7|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11185|The admirable roundness of the wrist was well set off by a bracelet which encircled it, and which also was ornamented and clasped by a magnificent aigrette of jewels-telling, in words that could not be mistaken, at once of the wealth and fastidious taste of the wearer. 1405755|8|7|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11186|At this impatience she smiled. 1406024|0|70|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11187|She urged the old story of decorum- that bug-bear which deters so many from bliss until the opportunity for bliss has forever gone by. 1406054|1|70|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11188|I had most imprudently made it known among my friends, she observed, that I desired her acquaintance- thus that I did not possess it–thus, again, there was no possibility of concealing the date of our first knowledge of each other. 1406188|2|70|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11189|And then she adverted, with a blush, to the extreme recency of this date. 1406419|3|70|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11190|To wed immediately would be improper–would be indecorous–would be outre. 1406492|4|70|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11191|All this she said with a charming air of naivete which enraptured while it grieved and convinced me. 1406564|5|70|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11192|She went even so far as to accuse me, laughingly, of rashness–of imprudence. 1406664|6|70|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11193|She bade me remember that I really even know not who she was–what were her prospects, her connections, her standing in society. 1406740|7|70|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11194|She begged me, but with a sigh, to reconsider my proposal, and termed my love an infatuation–a will o' the wisp–a fancy or fantasy of the moment–a baseless and unstable creation rather of the imagination than of the heart. 1406867|8|70|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11195|These things she uttered as the shadows of the sweet twilight gathered darkly and more darkly around us–and then, with a gentle pressure of her fairy-like hand, overthrew, in a single sweet instant, all the argumentative fabric she had reared. 1407089|9|70|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11196|I replied as best I could–as only a true lover can. 1407332|0|71|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11197|I spoke at length, and perseveringly of my devotion, of my passion–of her exceeding beauty, and of my own enthusiastic admiration. 1407383|1|71|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11198|In conclusion, I dwelt, with a convincing energy, upon the perils that encompass the course of love–that course of true love that never did run smooth–and thus deduced the manifest danger of rendering that course unnecessarily long. 1407513|2|71|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11199|This latter argument seemed finally to soften the rigor of her determination. 1407745|0|72|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11200|She relented; but there was yet an obstacle, she said, which she felt assured I had not properly considered. 1407822|1|72|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11201|This was a delicate point–for a woman to urge, especially so; in mentioning it, she saw that she must make a sacrifice of her feelings; still, for me, every sacrifice should be made. 1407930|2|72|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11202|She alluded to the topic of age. 1408112|3|72|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11203|Was I aware–was I fully aware of the discrepancy between us? 1408144|4|72|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11204|That the age of the husband, should surpass by a few years–even by fifteen or twenty–the age of the wife, was regarded by the world as admissible, and, indeed, as even proper, but she had always entertained the belief that the years of the wife should never exceed in number those of the husband. 1408204|5|72|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11205|A discrepancy of this unnatural kind gave rise, too frequently, alas! 1408500|6|72|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11206|to a life of unhappiness. 1408569|7|72|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11207|Now she was aware that my own age did not exceed two and twenty; and I, on the contrary, perhaps, was not aware that the years of my Eugenie extended very considerably beyond that sum. 1408594|8|72|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11208|About all this there was a nobility of soul–a dignity of candor- which delighted–which enchanted me–which eternally riveted my chains. 1408778|0|73|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11209|I could scarcely restrain the excessive transport which possessed me. 1408912|1|73|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11210|"""My sweetest Eugenie,"" I cried, ""what is all this about which you are discoursing? 1408981"|0|74|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11211|Your years surpass in some measure my own. 1409063|1|74|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11212|But what then? 1409105|2|74|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11213|The customs of the world are so many conventional follies. 1409119|3|74|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11214|To those who love as ourselves, in what respect differs a year from an hour? 1409177|4|74|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11215|I am twenty-two, you say, granted: indeed, you may as well call me, at once, twenty-three. 1409253|5|74|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11216|Here I paused for an instant, in the expectation that Madame Lalande would interrupt me by supplying her true age. 1409343|0|75|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11217|But a Frenchwoman is seldom direct, and has always, by way of answer to an embarrassing query, some little practical reply of her own. 1409457|1|75|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11218|In the present instance, Eugenie, who for a few moments past had seemed to be searching for something in her bosom, at length let fall upon the grass a miniature, which I immediately picked up and presented to her. 1409591|2|75|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11219|"""Keep it""! 1409805"|0|76|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']

11221|"""Keep it for my sake–for the sake of her whom it too flatteringly represents. 1409863"|2|76|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11222|Besides, upon the back of the trinket you may discover, perhaps, the very information you seem to desire. 1409940|3|76|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11223|It is now, to be sure, growing rather dark–but you can examine it at your leisure in the morning. 1410045|4|76|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11224|In the meantime, you shall be my escort home to-night. 1410142|5|76|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11225|My friends are about holding a little musical levee. 1410196|6|76|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11226|I can promise you, too, some good singing. 1410248|7|76|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11227|"We French are not nearly so punctilious as you Americans, and I shall have no difficulty in smuggling you in, in the character of an old acquaintance"". 1410290"|8|76|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11228|With this, she took my arm, and I attended her home. 1410441|0|77|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11229|The mansion was quite a fine one, and, I believe, furnished in good taste. 1410493|1|77|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11230|Of this latter point, however, I am scarcely qualified to judge; for it was just dark as we arrived; and in American mansions of the better sort lights seldom, during the heat of summer, make their appearance at this, the most pleasant period of the day. 1410567|2|77|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11231|In about an hour after my arrival, to be sure, a single shaded solar lamp was lit in the principal drawing-room; and this apartment, I could thus see, was arranged with unusual good taste and even splendor; but two other rooms of the suite, and in which the company chiefly assembled, remained, during the whole evening, in a very agreeable shadow. 1410821|3|77|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11232|This is a well-conceived custom, giving the party at least a choice of light or shade, and one which our friends over the water could not do better than immediately adopt. 1411169|4|77|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11233|The evening thus spent was unquestionably the most delicious of my life. 1411340|0|78|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11234|Madame Lalande had not overrated the musical abilities of her friends; and the singing I here heard I had never heard excelled in any private circle out of Vienna. 1411412|1|78|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11235|The instrumental performers were many and of superior talents. 1411575|2|78|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11236|The vocalists were chiefly ladies, and no individual sang less than well. 1411637|3|78|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11237|"At length, upon a peremptory call for ""Madame Lalande,"" she arose at once, without affectation or demur, from the chaise longue upon which she had sat by my side, and, accompanied by one or two gentlemen and her female friend of the opera, repaired to the piano in the main drawing-room. 1411710"|4|78|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11238|I would have escorted her myself, but felt that, under the circumstances of my introduction to the house, I had better remain unobserved where I was. 1411997|5|78|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11239|I was thus deprived of the pleasure of seeing, although not of hearing, her sing. 1412146|6|78|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11240|The impression she produced upon the company seemed electrical but the effect upon myself was something even more. 1412227|0|79|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11241|I know not how adequately to describe it. 1412341|1|79|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11242|It arose in part, no doubt, from the sentiment of love with which I was imbued; but chiefly from my conviction of the extreme sensibility of the singer. 1412382|2|79|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11243|It is beyond the reach of art to endow either air or recitative with more impassioned expression than was hers. 1412534|3|79|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11244|"Her utterance of the romance in Otello–the tone with which she gave the words ""Sul mio sasso,"" in the Capuletti–is ringing in my memory yet. 1412645"|4|79|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11245|Her lower tones were absolutely miraculous. 1412785|5|79|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11246|Her voice embraced three complete octaves, extending from the contralto D to the D upper soprano, and, though sufficiently powerful to have filled the San Carlos, executed, with the minutest precision, every difficulty of vocal composition-ascending and descending scales, cadences, or fiorituri. 1412828|6|79|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11247|"I gazed at this queenly apparition for at least half an hour, as if I had been suddenly converted to stone; and, during this period, I felt the full force and truth of all that has been said or sung concerning ""love at first sight"". 1413124"|0|8|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11248|My feelings were totally different from any which I had hitherto experienced, in the presence of even the most celebrated specimens of female loveliness. 1413356|1|8|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11249|An unaccountable, and what I am compelled to consider a magnetic, sympathy of soul for soul, seemed to rivet, not only my vision, but my whole powers of thought and feeling, upon the admirable object before me. 1413509|2|8|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11250|I saw–I felt–I knew that I was deeply, madly, irrevocably in love–and this even before seeing the face of the person beloved. 1413719|3|8|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11251|So intense, indeed, was the passion that consumed me, that I really believe it would have received little if any abatement had the features, yet unseen, proved of merely ordinary character, so anomalous is the nature of the only true love–of the love at first sight–and so little really dependent is it upon the external conditions which only seem to create and control it. 1413844|4|8|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11252|Ah! 1414217|0|80|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11253|Al contento ond 'io son piena. 1414220|0|81|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11254|Here, in imitation of Malibran, she modified the original phrase of Bellini, so as to let her voice descend to the tenor G, when, by a rapid transition, she struck the G above the treble stave, springing over an interval of two octaves. 1414250|0|82|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11255|Upon rising from the piano after these miracles of vocal execution, she resumed her seat by my side; when I expressed to her, in terms of the deepest enthusiasm, my delight at her performance. 1414486|0|83|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11256|Of my surprise I said nothing, and yet was I most unfeignedly surprised; for a certain feebleness, or rather a certain tremulous indecision of voice in ordinary conversation, had prepared me to anticipate that, in singing, she would not acquit herself with any remarkable ability. 1414678|1|83|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11257|Our conversation was now long, earnest, uninterrupted, and totally unreserved. 1414958|0|84|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11258|She made me relate many of the earlier passages of my life, and listened with breathless attention to every word of the narrative. 1415036|1|84|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11259|I concealed nothing–felt that I had a right to conceal nothing–from her confiding affection. 1415166|2|84|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11260|Encouraged by her candor upon the delicate point of her age, I entered, with perfect frankness, not only into a detail of my many minor vices, but made full confession of those moral and even of those physical infirmities, the disclosure of which, in demanding so much higher a degree of courage, is so much surer an evidence of love. 1415258|3|84|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11261|I touched upon my college indiscretions–upon my extravagances–upon my carousals- upon my debts–upon my flirtations. 1415592|4|84|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11262|I even went so far as to speak of a slightly hectic cough with which, at one time, I had been troubled–of a chronic rheumatism–of a twinge of hereditary gout- and, in conclusion, of the disagreeable and inconvenient, but hitherto carefully concealed, weakness of my eyes. 1415707|5|84|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11263|"""Upon this latter point,"" said Madame Lalande, laughingly, ""you have been surely injudicious in coming to confession; for, without the confession, I take it for granted that no one would have accused you of the crime. 1415978"|0|85|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11264|"By the by,"" she continued, ""have you any recollection-"" and here I fancied that a blush, even through the gloom of the apartment, became distinctly visible upon her cheek–""have you any recollection, mon cher ami of this little ocular assistant, which now depends from my neck""? 1416195"|1|85|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11265|As she spoke she twirled in her fingers the identical double eye-glass which had so overwhelmed me with confusion at the opera. 1416472|0|86|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11266|"""Full well–alas! 1416599"|0|87|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11267|"do I remember it,"" I exclaimed, pressing passionately the delicate hand which offered the glasses for my inspection. 1416615"|1|87|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11268|They formed a complex and magnificent toy, richly chased and filigreed, and gleaming with jewels, which, even in the deficient light, I could not help perceiving were of high value. 1416731|2|87|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11269|"""Eh bien! 1416912"|0|88|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11270|"mon ami"" she resumed with a certain empressment of manner that rather surprised me–""Eh bien! 1416921"|1|88|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11271|mon ami, you have earnestly besought of me a favor which you have been pleased to denominate priceless. 1417013|2|88|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11272|You have demanded of me my hand upon the morrow. 1417116|3|88|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11273|"Should I yield to your entreaties–and, I may add, to the pleadings of my own bosom–would I not be entitled to demand of you a very–a very little boon in return""? 1417164"|4|88|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11274|"""Name it""! 1417325"|0|89|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11275|I exclaimed with an energy that had nearly drawn upon us the observation of the company, and restrained by their presence alone from throwing myself impetuously at her feet. 1417335|1|89|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11276|"""Name it, my beloved, my Eugenie, my own! 1417508"|2|89|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11277|–name it! 1417549|3|89|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11278|–but, alas! 1417558|4|89|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11279|"it is already yielded ere named"". 1417569"|5|89|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11280|While I was thus wrapped in admiration of this lovely vision, a sudden disturbance among the audience caused her to turn her head partially toward me, so that I beheld the entire profile of the face. 1417602|0|9|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11281|Its beauty even exceeded my anticipations–and yet there was something about it which disappointed me without my being able to tell exactly what it was. 1417801|1|9|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11282|"I said ""disappointed,"" but this is not altogether the word. 1417952"|2|9|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11283|My sentiments were at once quieted and exalted. 1418011|3|9|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11284|They partook less of transport and more of calm enthusiasm of enthusiastic repose. 1418058|4|9|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11285|This state of feeling arose, perhaps, from the Madonna-like and matronly air of the face; and yet I at once understood that it could not have arisen entirely from this. 1418140|5|9|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11286|There was something else- some mystery which I could not develope–some expression about the countenance which slightly disturbed me while it greatly heightened my interest. 1418308|6|9|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11287|In fact, I was just in that condition of mind which prepares a young and susceptible man for any act of extravagance. 1418480|7|9|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11288|Had the lady been alone, I should undoubtedly have entered her box and accosted her at all hazards; but, fortunately, she was attended by two companions–a gentleman, and a strikingly beautiful woman, to all appearance a few years younger than herself. 1418597|8|9|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11289|"""You shall conquer, then, mon ami,"" said she, ""for the sake of the Eugenie whom you love, this little weakness which you have at last confessed–this weakness more moral than physical–and which, let me assure you, is so unbecoming the nobility of your real nature–so inconsistent with the candor of your usual character–and which, if permitted further control, will assuredly involve you, sooner or later, in some very disagreeable scrape. 1418848"|0|90|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11290|You shall conquer, for my sake, this affectation which leads you, as you yourself acknowledge, to the tacit or implied denial of your infirmity of vision. 1419286|1|90|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11291|For, this infirmity you virtually deny, in refusing to employ the customary means for its relief. 1419440|2|90|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11292|You will understand me to say, then, that I wish you to wear spectacles;–ah, hush! 1419537|3|90|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11293|–you have already consented to wear them, for my sake. 1419619|4|90|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11294|You shall accept the little toy which I now hold in my hand, and which, though admirable as an aid to vision, is really of no very immense value as a gem. 1419673|5|90|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11295|You perceive that, by a trifling modification thus–or thus–it can be adapted to the eyes in the form of spectacles, or worn in the waistcoat pocket as an eye-glass. 1419827|6|90|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11296|"It is in the former mode, however, and habitually, that you have already consented to wear it for my sake"". 1419991"|7|90|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11297|This request–must I confess it? 1420098|0|91|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11298|–confused me in no little degree. 1420129|1|91|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11299|But the condition with which it was coupled rendered hesitation, of course, a matter altogether out of the question. 1420162|2|91|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11300|"""It is done""! 1420278"|0|92|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11301|I cried, with all the enthusiasm that I could muster at the moment. 1420291|1|92|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11302|"""It is done–it is most cheerfully agreed. 1420358"|2|92|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11303|I sacrifice every feeling for your sake. 1420399|3|92|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11304|"To-night I wear this dear eye-glass, as an eye-glass, and upon my heart; but with the earliest dawn of that morning which gives me the pleasure of calling you wife, I will place it upon my–upon my nose,–and there wear it ever afterward, in the less romantic, and less fashionable, but certainly in the more serviceable, form which you desire"". 1420439"|4|92|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11305|Our conversation now turned upon the details of our arrangements for the morrow. 1420782|0|93|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11306|Talbot, I learned from my betrothed, had just arrived in town. 1420862|1|93|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11307|I was to see him at once, and procure a carriage. 1420924|2|93|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11308|The soiree would scarcely break up before two; and by this hour the vehicle was to be at the door, when, in the confusion occasioned by the departure of the company, Madame L. could easily enter it unobserved. 1420973|3|93|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11309|We were then to call at the house of a clergyman who would be in waiting; there be married, drop Talbot, and proceed on a short tour to the East, leaving the fashionable world at home to make whatever comments upon the matter it thought best. 1421182|4|93|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11310|Having planned all this, I immediately took leave, and went in search of Talbot, but, on the way, I could not refrain from stepping into a hotel, for the purpose of inspecting the miniature; and this I did by the powerful aid of the glasses. 1421424|0|94|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11311|The countenance was a surpassingly beautiful one! 1421665|1|94|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11312|Those large luminous eyes! 1421714|2|94|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11313|–that proud Grecian nose! 1421740|3|94|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11314|–those dark luxuriant curls! 1421765|4|94|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11315|"–""Ah""! 1421793"|5|94|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11316|"said I, exultingly to myself, ""this is indeed the speaking image of my beloved""! 1421799"|6|94|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11317|"I turned the reverse, and discovered the words–""Eugenie Lalande–aged twenty-seven years and seven months"". 1421879"|7|94|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11318|I found Talbot at home, and proceeded at once to acquaint him with my good fortune. 1421985|0|95|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11319|He professed excessive astonishment, of course, but congratulated me most cordially, and proffered every assistance in his power. 1422068|1|95|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11320|In a word, we carried out our arrangement to the letter, and, at two in the morning, just ten minutes after the ceremony, I found myself in a close carriage with Madame Lalande–with Mrs. Simpson, I should say–and driving at a great rate out of town, in a direction Northeast by North, half-North. 1422197|2|95|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11321|It had been determined for us by Talbot, that, as we were to be up all night, we should make our first stop at C--, a village about twenty miles from the city, and there get an early breakfast and some repose, before proceeding upon our route. 1422493|0|96|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']
11322|At four precisely, therefore, the carriage drew up at the door of the principal inn. 1422736|1|96|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']

11325|It was now nearly if not altogether daylight; and, as I gazed, enraptured, at the angel by my side, the singular idea came, all at once, into my head, that this was really the very first moment since my acquaintance with the celebrated loveliness of Madame Lalande, that I had enjoyed a near inspection of that loveliness by daylight at all. 1422945|0|97|The Spectacles|1844-03-27 00:00:00|['Humor']

11345|- Arrival at Sullivan's Island, near Charlestown, S. C., of Mr. Mason, Mr. Robert Holland, Mr. Henson, Mr. Harrison Ainsworth, and four others, in the Steering Balloon, Victoria, after a Passage of Seventy-five Hours from Land to Land! 1424958|3|1|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']

11347|So well satisfied, however, was Mr. Mason of the ultimate success of his invention, that he determined to construct immediately, if possible, a balloon of sufficient capacity to test the question by a voyage of some extent; the original design being to cross the British Channel, as before, in the Nassau balloon. 1425224|0|10|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11348|To carry out his views, he solicited and obtained the patronage of Sir Everard Bringhurst and Mr. Osborne, two gentlemen well known for scientific acquirement, and especially for the interest they have exhibited in the progress of aerostation. 1425537|1|10|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11349|The project, at the desire of Mr. Osborne, was kept a profound secret from the public;the only persons entrusted with the design being those actually engaged in the construction of the machine, which was built (under the superintendence of Mr. Mason, Mr. Holland, Sir Everard Bringhurst, and Mr. Osborne) at the seat of the latter gentleman near Penstruthal, in Wales. 1425780|2|10|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11350|Mr. Henson, accompanied by his friend Mr. Ainsworth, was admitted to a private view of the balloon, on Saturday last; when the two gentlemen made final arrangements to be included in the adventure. 1426148|3|10|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11351|We are not informed for what reason the two seamen were also included in the party;but in the course of a day or two, we shall put our readers in possession of the minutest particulars respecting this extraordinary voyage. 1426345|4|10|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11352|The balloon is composed of silk, varnished with the liquid gum caoutchouc. 1426567|0|11|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11353|It is of vast dimensions, containing more than 40,000 cubic feet of gas; but as coal gas was employed in place of the more expensive and inconvenient hydrogen, the supporting power of the machine, when fully inflated, and immediately after inflation, is not more than about 2500 pounds. 1426641|1|11|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11354|The coal gas is not only much less costly, but is easily procured and managed. 1426927|2|11|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11355|For its introduction into common use for purposes of aerostation, we are indebted to Mr. Charles Green. 1427005|0|12|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11356|Up to his discovery, the process of inflation was not only exceedingly expensive, but uncertain. 1427108|1|12|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11357|Two and even three days have frequently been wasted in futile attempts to procure a sufficiency of hydrogen to fill a balloon, from which it had great tendency to escape, owing to its extreme subtlety, and its affinity for the surrounding atmosphere. 1427204|2|12|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11358|In a balloon sufficiently perfect to retain its contents of coal gas unaltered, in quantity or amount, for six months, an equal quantity of hydrogen could not be maintained in equal purity for six weeks. 1427454|3|12|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11359|The supporting power being estimated at 2500 pounds, and the united weights of the party amounting only to about 1200, there was left a surplus of 1300, of which again 1200 was exhausted by ballast, arranged in bags of different sizes, with their respective weights marked upon them;by cordage, barometers, telescopes, barrels containing provision for a fortnight, water-casks, cloaks, carpet-bags, and various other indispensable matters, including a coffee-warmer, contrived for warming coffee by means of slack-lime, so as to dispense altogether with fire, if it should be judged prudent to do so. 1427657|0|13|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11360|All these articles, with the exception of the ballast, and a few trifles, were suspended from the hoop overhead. 1428257|1|13|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11361|The car is much smaller and lighter, in proportion, than the one appended to the model. 1428369|2|13|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11362|It is formed of a light wicker, and is wonderfully strong for so frail looking a machine. 1428456|3|13|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11363|Its rim is about 4 feet deep. 1428545|4|13|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11364|The rudder is also very much larger, in proportion, than that of the model; and the screw is considerably smaller. 1428574|5|13|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11365|The balloon is furnished besides with a grapnel, and a guide-rope, which latter is of the most indispensable importance. 1428688|6|13|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11366|A few words, in explanation, will here be necessary for such of our readers as are not conversant with the details of aerostation. 1428808|7|13|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11367|As soon as the balloon quits the earth, it is subjected to the influence of many circumstances tending to create a difference in its weight; augmenting or diminishing its ascending power. 1428938|0|14|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11368|For example, there may be a deposition of dew upon the silk, to the extent, even, of several hundred pounds; ballast has then to be thrown out, or the machine may descend. 1429125|1|14|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11369|This ballast being discarded, and a clear sunshine evaporating the dew, and at the same time expanding the gas in the silk, the whole will again rapidly ascend. 1429296|2|14|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11370|To check this ascent, the only recourse is (or rather was, until Mr. Green's invention of the guide-rope) the permission of the escape of gas from the valve; but, in the loss of gas, is a proportionate general loss of ascending power; so that, in a comparatively brief period, the best-constructed balloon must necessarily exhaust all its resources, and come to the earth. 1429456|3|14|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11371|This was the great obstacle to voyages of length. 1429828|4|14|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11372|The guide-rope remedies the difficulty in the simplest manner conceivable. 1429877|0|15|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11373|It is merely a very long rope which is suffered to trail from the car, and the effect of which is to prevent the balloon from changing its level in any material degree. 1429951|1|15|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11374|When there is no angle;in other words, when the rope hangs perpendicularly, the whole apparatus is stationary; but the larger the angle, that is to say, the farther the balloon precedes the end of the rope, the greater the velocity; and the converse. 1430119|10|15|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11375|If, for example, there should be a deposition of moisture upon, the silk, and the machine begins to descend in consequence, there will be no necessity for discharging ballast to remedy the increase of weight, for it is remedied, or counteracted, in an exactly just proportion, by the deposit on the ground of just so much of the end of the rope as is necessary. 1430369|2|15|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11376|If, on the other hand, any circumstances should cause undue levity, and consequent ascent, this levity is immediately counteracted by the additional weight of rope upraised from the earth. 1430730|3|15|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11377|Thus, the balloon can neither ascend nor descend, except within very narrow limits, and its resources, either in gas or ballast, remain comparatively unimpaired. 1430918|4|15|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11378|When passing over an expanse of water, it becomes necessary to employ small kegs of copper or wood, filled with liquid ballast of a lighter nature than water. 1431079|5|15|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11379|These float, and serve all the purposes of a mere rope on land. 1431237|6|15|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11380|Another most important office of the guide-rope, is to point out the direction of the balloon. 1431300|7|15|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11381|The rope drags, either on land or sea, while the balloon is free; the latter, consequently, is always in advance, when any progress whatever is made, a comparison, therefore, by means of the compass, of the relative positions of the two objects, will always indicate the course. 1431394|8|15|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11382|In the same way, the angle formed by the rope with the vertical axis of the machine, indicates the velocity. 1431672|9|15|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11383|As the original design was to cross the British Channel, and alight as near Paris as possible, the voyagers had taken the precaution to prepare themselves with passports directed to all parts of the Continent, specifying the nature of the expedition, as in the case of the Nassau voyage, and entitling the adventurers to exemption from the usual formalities of office; unexpected events, however, rendered these passports superfluous. 1431780|0|16|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11384|The inflation was commenced very quietly at day-break, on Saturday morning, the 6th instant in the courtyard of Wheal-Vor House, Mr. Osborne's seat, about a mile from Penstruthal, in North Wales; and at 7 minutes past 11, everything being ready for departure, the balloon was set free, rising gently but steadily, in a direction nearly South; no use being made, for the first half hour, of either the screw or the rudder. 1432214|0|17|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11385|We proceed now with the journal, as transcribed by Mr. Forsyth from the joint MSS. 1432635|1|17|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11386|of Mr. Monck Mason and Mr. Ainsworth. 1432717|2|17|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11387|The body of the journal, as given, is in the handwriting of Mr. Mason, and a P. S. is appended, each day, by Mr. Ainsworth, who has in preparation, and will shortly give the public a more minute and, no doubt, a thrillingly interesting account of the voyage. 1432754|3|17|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11388|Saturday, April the 6th. 1433012|0|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11389|;Every preparation likely to embarrass us having been made overnight, we commenced the inflation this morning at daybreak; but owing to a thick fog which encumbered the folds of the silk and rendered it unmanageable, we did not get through before nearly eleven o'clock. 1433036|1|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11390|We were rapidly approaching the mountains in the South, but our elevation was more than sufficient to enable us to pass them in safety. 1433305|10|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11391|In a few minutes we soared over them in fine style; and Mr. Ainsworth, with the seamen, was surprised at their apparent want of altitude when viewed from the car, the tendency of great elevation in a balloon being to reduce inequalities of the surface below, to nearly a dead level. 1433440|11|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11392|At half-past eleven still proceeding nearly South, we obtained our first view of the Bristol Channel; and, in fifteen minutes afterward, the line of breakers on the coast appeared immediately beneath us, and we were fairly out at sea. 1433722|12|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11393|We now resolved to let off enough gas to bring our guide-rope, with the buoys affixed, into the water. 1433956|13|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11394|This was immediately done, and we commenced a gradual descent. 1434058|14|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11395|In about 20 minutes our first buoy dipped, and at the touch of the second soon afterward, we remained stationary as to elevation. 1434120|15|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11396|We were all now anxious to test the efficiency of the rudder and screw, and we put them both into requisition forthwith, for the purpose of altering our direction more to the eastward, and in a line for Paris. 1434249|16|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11397|By means of the rudder we instantly effected the necessary change of direction, and our course was brought nearly at right angles to that of the wind; when we set in motion the spring of the screw, and were rejoiced to find it propel us readily as desired. 1434458|17|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11398|Upon this we gave nine hearty cheers, and dropped in the sea a bottle, inclosing a slip of parchment with a brief account of the principle of the invention. 1434714|18|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11399|Hardly, however, had we done with our rejoicings, when an unforeseen accident occurred which discouraged us in no little degree. 1434870|19|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11400|Cut loose, then, in high spirits, and rose gently but steadily, with a light breeze at North, which bore us in the direction of the Bristol Channel. 1434998|2|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11401|The steel rod connecting the spring with the propeller was suddenly jerked out of place, at the car end, (by a swaying of the car through some movement of one of the two seamen we had taken up,) and in an instant hung dangling out of reach, from the pivot of the axis of the screw. 1435146|20|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11402|While we were endeavoring to regain it, our attention being completely absorbed, we became involved in a strong current of wind from the East, which bore us, with rapidly increasing force, toward the Atlantic. 1435427|21|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11403|We soon found ourselves driving out to sea at the rate of not less, certainly, than 50 or 60 miles an hour, so that we came up with Cape Clear, at some 40 miles to our North, before we had secured the rod, and had time to think what we were about. 1435636|22|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11404|It was now that Mr. Ainsworth made an extraordinary but, to my fancy, a by no means unreasonable or chimerical proposition, in which he was instantly seconded by Mr. Holland-viz. 1435883|23|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11405|: that we should take advantage of the strong gale which bore us on, and in place of beating back to Paris, make an attempt to reach the coast of North America. 1436061|24|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11406|After slight reflection, I gave a willing assent to this bold proposition, which (strange to say) met with objection from the two seamen only. 1436221|25|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11407|As the stronger party, however, we overruled their fears, and kept resolutely upon our course. 1436363|26|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11408|We steered due West; but as the trailing of the buoys materially impeded our progress, and we had the balloon abundantly at command, either for ascent or descent, we first threw out fifty pounds of ballast, and then wound up (by means of a windlass) so much of the rope as brought it quite clear of the sea. 1436457|27|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11409|We perceived the effect of this manoeuvre immediately, in a vastly increased rate of progress; and, as the gale freshened, we flew with a velocity nearly inconceivable; the guide-rope flying out behind the car, like a streamer from a vessel. 1436764|28|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11410|It is needless to say that a very short time sufficed us to lose sight of the coast. 1437005|29|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11411|Found the ascending force greater than we had expected; and as we arose higher and so got clear of the cliffs, and more in the sun's rays, our ascent became very rapid. 1437089|3|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11412|We passed over innumerable vessels of all kinds, a few of which were endeavoring to beat up, but the most of them lying to. 1437257|30|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11413|We occasioned the greatest excitement on board all;an excitement greatly relished by ourselves, and especially by our two men, who, now under the influence of a dram of Geneva, seemed resolved to give all scruple, or fear, to the wind. 1437380|31|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11414|Many of the vessels fired signal guns; and in all we were saluted with loud cheers (which we heard with surprising distinctness) and the waving of caps and handkerchiefs. 1437615|32|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11415|We kept on in this manner throughout the day with no material incident, and, as the shades of night closed around us, we made a rough estimate of the distance traversed. 1437785|33|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11416|It could not have been less than 500 miles, and was probably much more. 1437954|34|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11417|The propeller was kept in constant operation, and, no doubt, aided our progress materially. 1438025|35|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11418|As the sun went down, the gale freshened into an absolute hurricane, and the ocean beneath was clearly visible on account of its phosphorescence. 1438116|36|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11419|The wind was from the East all night, and gave us the brightest omen of success. 1438261|37|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11420|We suffered no little from cold, and the dampness of the atmosphere was most unpleasant; but the ample space in the car enabled us to lie down, and by means of cloaks and a few blankets we did sufficiently well. 1438341|38|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11421|I did not wish, however, to lose gas at so early a period of the adventure, and so concluded to ascend for the present. 1438552|4|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11422|We soon ran out our guide-rope; but even when we had raised it clear of the earth, we still went up very rapidly. 1438671|5|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11423|The balloon was unusually steady, and looked beautifully. 1438784|6|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11424|In about 10 minutes after starting, the barometer indicated an altitude of 15,000 feet. 1438841|7|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11425|The weather was remarkably fine, and the view of the subjacent country;a most romantic one when seen from any point;was now especially sublime. 1438928|8|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11426|The numerous deep gorges presented the appearance of lakes, on account of the dense vapors with which they were filled, and the pinnacles and crags to the South East, piled in inextricable confusion, resembling nothing so much as the giant cities of Eastern fable. 1439071|9|19|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11427|The subjoined jeu d'esprit with the preceding heading in magnificent capitals, well interspersed with notes of admiration, was originally published, as matter of fact, in the New York Sun, a daily newspaper, and therein fully subserved the purpose of creating indigestible aliment for the quidnuncs during the few hours intervening between a couple of the Charleston mails. 1439335|0|2|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11428|"The rush for the ""sole paper which had the news"" was something beyond even the prodigious; and, in fact, if (as some assert) the Victoria did not absolutely accomplish the voyage recorded it will be difficult to assign a reason why she should not have accomplished it. 1439708"|1|2|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']

11436|] This morning the gale, by 10, had subsided to an eight;or nine;knot breeze (for a vessel at sea), and bears us, perhaps, 30 miles per hour, or more. 1440304|2|20|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11437|It has veered, however, very considerably to the North; and now, at sundown, we are holding our course due West, principally by the screw and rudder, which answer their purposes to admiration. 1440454|3|20|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11438|I regard the project as thoroughly successful, and the easy navigation of the air in any direction (not exactly in the teeth of a gale) as no longer problematical. 1440646|4|20|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11439|We could not have made head against the strong wind of yesterday, but, by ascending, we might have got out of its influence, if requisite. 1440809|5|20|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11440|Against a pretty stiff breeze, I feel convinced, we can make our way with the propeller. 1440947|6|20|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11441|At noon, today, ascended to an elevation of nearly 25,000 feet, (about the height of Cotopaxi) by discharging ballast. 1441035|7|20|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11442|Did this to search for a more direct current, but found none so favorable as the one we are now in. 1441153|8|20|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']

11450|The latter could not be improved. 1441735|3|21|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11451|The wind has been blowing steadily and strongly from the North-East all day; and so far fortune seems bent upon favoring us. 1441768|4|21|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11452|Just before day, we were all somewhat alarmed at some odd noises and concussions in the balloon, accompanied with the apparent rapid subsidence of the whole machine. 1441892|5|21|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11453|These phenomena were occasioned by the expansion of the gas, through increase of heat in the atmosphere, and the consequent disruption of the minute particles of ice with which the network had become encrusted during the night. 1442057|6|21|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']

11469|It was nearly dead calm when the voyagers first came in view of the coast, which was immediately recognized by both the seamen, and by Mr. Osborne. 1443153|2|23|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11470|The latter gentleman having acquaintances at Fort Moultrie, it was immediately resolved to descend in its vicinity. 1443300|3|23|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11471|The balloon was brought over the beach (the tide being out and the sand hard, smooth, and admirably adapted for a descent), and the grapnel let go, which took firm hold at once. 1443415|4|23|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11472|The inhabitants of the Island, and of the Fort, thronged out, of course, to see the balloon; but it was with the greatest difficulty that any one could be made to credit the actual voyage;the crossing of the Atlantic. 1443592|5|23|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11473|The grapnel caught at 2 P.M. precisely; and thus the whole voyage was completed in 75 hours; or rather less, counting from shore to shore. 1443809|6|23|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']

11485|The particulars furnished below may be relied on as authentic and accurate in every respect, as, with a slight exception, they are copied verbatim from the joint diaries of Mr. Monck Mason and Mr. Harrison Ainsworth, to whose politeness our agent is also indebted for much verbal information respecting the balloon itself, its construction, and other matters of interest. 1445304|6|3|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11486|The only alteration in the MS. 1445675|7|3|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11487|received, has been made for the purpose of throwing the hurried account of our agent, Mr. Forsyth, into a connected and intelligible form. 1445705|8|3|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11488|Two very decided failures, of late,;those of Mr. Henson and Sir George Cayley,;had much weakened the public interest in the subject of aerial navigation. 1445843|0|5|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11489|Mr. Henson's scheme (which at first was considered very feasible even by men of science) was founded upon the principle of an inclined plane, started from an eminence by an extrinsic force, applied and continued by the revolution of impinging vanes, in form and number resembling the vanes of a windmill. 1445996|1|5|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11490|But, in all the experiments made with models at the Adelaide Gallery, it was found that the operation of these fins not only did not propel the machine, but actually impeded its flight. 1446300|2|5|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11491|The only propelling force it ever exhibited, was the mere impetus acquired from the descent of the inclined plane, and this impetus carried the machine farther when the vanes were at rest, than when they were in motion;a fact which sufficiently demonstrates their inutility, and in the absence of the propelling, which was also the sustaining power, the whole fabric would necessarily descend. 1446485|3|5|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11492|This consideration led Sir George Cayley to think only of adapting a propeller to some machine having of itself an independent power of support;in a word, to a balloon; the idea, however, being novel, or original, with Sir George, only so far as regards the mode of its application to practice. 1446878|4|5|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11493|He exhibited a model of his invention at the Polytechnic Institution. 1447172|5|5|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11494|The propelling principle, or power, was here, also, applied to interrupted surfaces, or vanes, put in revolution. 1447241|6|5|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11495|These vanes were four in number, but were found entirely ineffectual in moving the balloon, or in aiding its ascending power. 1447354|7|5|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11496|The whole project was thus a complete failure. 1447479|8|5|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11497|It was at this juncture that Mr. Monck Mason (whose voyage from Dover to Weilburg in the balloon Nassau occasioned so much excitement in 1837) conceived the idea of employing the principle of the Archimedean screw for the purpose of propulsion through the air- rightly attributing the failure of Mr. Henson's scheme, and of Sir George Cayley's to the interruption of surface in the independent vanes. 1447525|0|6|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11498|He made the first public experiment at Willis's Rooms, but afterward removed his model to the Adelaide Gallery. 1447925|1|6|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11499|Like Sir George Cayley's balloon, his own was an ellipsoid. 1448036|0|7|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11500|Its length was 13 feet 6 inches;height, 6 feet 8 inches. 1448095|1|7|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11501|It contained about 320 cubic feet of gas, which, if pure hydrogen, would support 21 pounds upon its first inflation, before the gas has time to deteriorate or escape. 1448151|2|7|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11502|The weight of the whole machine and apparatus was 17 pounds;leaving about 4 pounds to spare. 1448317|3|7|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11503|Beneath the centre of the balloon, was a frame of light wood, about 9 feet long, and rigged on to the balloon itself with a net-work in the customary manner. 1448409|4|7|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11504|From this framework was suspended a wicker basket or car. 1448566|5|7|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11505|The screw consists of an axis of hollow brass tube, 18 inches in length, through which, upon a semi-spiral inclined at 15 degrees, pass a series of steel-wire radii, 2 feet long, and thus projecting a foot on either side. 1448623|0|8|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11506|These radii are connected at the outer extremities by 2 bands of flattened wire; the whole in this manner forming the framework of the screw, which is completed by a covering of oiled silk cut into gores, and tightened so as to present a tolerably uniform surface. 1448844|1|8|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11507|Its weight was about 2 ounces. 1449108|10|8|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11508|It could be turned flat, and directed upward or downward, as well as to the right or left-, and thus enabled the aeronaut to transfer the resistance of the air which in an inclined position it must generate in its passage, to any side upon which he might desire to act; thus determining the balloon in the opposite direction. 1449138|11|8|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11509|At each end of its axis this screw is supported by pillars of hollow brass tube descending from the hoop. 1449463|2|8|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11510|In the lower ends of these tubes are holes in which the pivots of the axis revolve. 1449568|3|8|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11511|From the end of the axis which is next the car, proceeds a shaft of steel, connecting the screw with the pinion of a piece of spring machinery fixed in the car. 1449651|4|8|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11512|By the operation of this spring, the screw is made to revolve with great rapidity, communicating a progressive motion to the whole. 1449811|5|8|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11513|By means of the rudder, the machine was readily turned in any direction. 1449942|6|8|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11514|The spring was of great power, compared with its dimensions, being capable of raising 45 pounds upon a barrel of 4 inches diameter, after the first turn, and gradually increasing as it was wound up. 1450014|7|8|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11515|It weighed, altogether, eight pounds six ounces. 1450212|8|8|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11516|The rudder was a light frame of cane covered with silk, shaped somewhat like a battledoor, and was about 3 feet long, and at the widest, one foot. 1450260|9|8|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11517|This model (which, through want of time, we have necessarily described in an imperfect manner) was put in action at the Adelaide Gallery, where it accomplished a velocity of 5 miles per hour; although, strange to say, it excited very little interest in comparison with the previous complex machine of Mr. Henson;so resolute is the world to despise anything which carries with it an air of simplicity. 1450406|0|9|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11518|To accomplish the great desideratum of aerial navigation, it was very generally supposed that some exceedingly complicated application must be made of some unusually profound principle in dynamics. 1450806|1|9|The Balloon-Hoax|1844-04-13 00:00:00|['Hoax']
11519|DURING the fall of the year 1827, while residing near Charlottesville, Virginia, I casually made the acquaintance of Mr. Augustus Bedloe. 1451003|0|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11520|This young gentleman was remarkable in every respect, and excited in me a profound interest and curiosity. 1451140|1|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']

11522|His forehead was broad and low. 1451292|11|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11523|His complexion was absolutely bloodless. 1451323|12|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11524|His mouth was large and flexible, and his teeth were more wildly uneven, although sound, than I had ever before seen teeth in a human head. 1451363|13|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11525|The expression of his smile, however, was by no means unpleasing, as might be supposed; but it had no variation whatever. 1451502|14|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11526|It was one of profound melancholy–of a phaseless and unceasing gloom. 1451623|15|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11527|His eyes were abnormally large, and round like those of a cat. 1451692|16|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11528|The pupils, too, upon any accession or diminution of light, underwent contraction or dilation, just such as is observed in the feline tribe. 1451754|17|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11529|In moments of excitement the orbs grew bright to a degree almost inconceivable; seeming to emit luminous rays, not of a reflected but of an intrinsic lustre, as does a candle or the sun; yet their ordinary condition was so totally vapid, filmy, and dull as to convey the idea of the eyes of a long-interred corpse. 1451894|18|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']

11533|Even about his age–although I call him a young gentleman–there was something which perplexed me in no little degree. 1452383|5|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11534|He certainly seemed young–and he made a point of speaking about his youth–yet there were moments when I should have had little trouble in imagining him a hundred years of age. 1452499|6|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11535|But in no regard was he more peculiar than in his personal appearance. 1452674|7|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11536|He was singularly tall and thin. 1452744|8|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11537|He stooped much. 1452776|9|0|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11538|These peculiarities of person appeared to cause him much annoyance, and he was continually alluding to them in a sort of half explanatory, half apologetic strain, which, when I first heard it, impressed me very painfully. 1452792|0|1|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11539|I soon, however, grew accustomed to it, and my uneasiness wore off. 1453013|1|1|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11540|It seemed to be his design rather to insinuate than directly to assert that, physically, he had not always been what he was–that a long series of neuralgic attacks had reduced him from a condition of more than usual personal beauty, to that which I saw. 1453080|2|1|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11541|For many years past he had been attended by a physician, named Templeton–an old gentleman, perhaps seventy years of age–whom he had first encountered at Saratoga, and from whose attention, while there, he either received, or fancied that he received, great benefit. 1453333|3|1|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11542|The result was that Bedloe, who was wealthy, had made an arrangement with Dr. Templeton, by which the latter, in consideration of a liberal annual allowance, had consented to devote his time and medical experience exclusively to the care of the invalid. 1453598|4|1|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']

11547|I pinched my limbs. 1454082|4|10|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11548|A small spring of water presented itself to my view, and here, stooping, I bathed my hands and my head and neck. 1454101|5|10|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']

11556|The tree was a palm. 1454759|5|11|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']

11561|A low, continuous murmur, like that arising from a full, but gently flowing river, came to my ears, intermingled with the peculiar hum of multitudinous human voices. 1455099|4|12|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']

11564|On the margin of this river stood an Eastern-looking city, such as we read of in the Arabian Tales, but of a character even more singular than any there described. 1455566|1|14|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11565|Beyond the limits of the city arose, in frequent majestic groups, the palm and the cocoa, with other gigantic and weird trees of vast age, and here and there might be seen a field of rice, the thatched hut of a peasant, a tank, a stray temple, a gypsy camp, or a solitary graceful maiden taking her way, with a pitcher upon her head, to the banks of the magnificent river. 1455729|10|14|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']

11567|The streets seemed innumerable, and crossed each other irregularly in all directions, but were rather long winding alleys than streets, and absolutely swarmed with inhabitants. 1456232|3|14|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']

11571|Besides these things, were seen, on all sides, banners and palanquins, litters with stately dames close veiled, elephants gorgeously caparisoned, idols grotesquely hewn, drums, banners, and gongs, spears, silver and gilded maces. 1456729|7|14|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11572|And amid the crowd, and the clamor, and the general intricacy and confusion- amid the million of black and yellow men, turbaned and robed, and of flowing beard, there roamed a countless multitude of holy filleted bulls, while vast legions of the filthy but sacred ape clambered, chattering and shrieking, about the cornices of the mosques, or clung to the minarets and oriels. 1456958|8|14|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11573|From the swarming streets to the banks of the river, there descended innumerable flights of steps leading to bathing places, while the river itself seemed to force a passage with difficulty through the vast fleets of deeply–burthened ships that far and wide encountered its surface. 1457334|9|14|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']

11614|It is only now, in the year 1845, when similar miracles are witnessed daily by thousands, that I dare venture to record this apparent impossibility as a matter of serious fact. 1461713|10|2|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11615|The Doctor, however, like all enthusiasts, had struggled hard to make a thorough convert of his pupil, and finally so far gained his point as to induce the sufferer to submit to numerous experiments. 1461889|2|2|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11616|By a frequent repetition of these, a result had arisen, which of late days has become so common as to attract little or no attention, but which, at the period of which I write, had very rarely been known in America. 1462088|3|2|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11617|I mean to say, that between Doctor Templeton and Bedloe there had grown up, little by little, a very distinct and strongly marked rapport, or magnetic relation. 1462303|4|2|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11618|I am not prepared to assert, however, that this rapport extended beyond the limits of the simple sleep-producing power, but this power itself had attained great intensity. 1462463|5|2|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11619|At the first attempt to induce the magnetic somnolency, the mesmerist entirely failed. 1462634|6|2|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11620|In the fifth or sixth he succeeded very partially, and after long continued effort. 1462720|7|2|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11621|Only at the twelfth was the triumph complete. 1462803|8|2|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11622|After this the will of the patient succumbed rapidly to that of the physician, so that, when I first became acquainted with the two, sleep was brought about almost instantaneously by the mere volition of the operator, even when the invalid was unaware of his presence. 1462848|9|2|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11623|When I said these words, I of course expected some lively sally from Bedloe in reply, but, to my astonishment, he hesitated, trembled, became fearfully pallid, and remained silent. 1463116|0|20|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11624|I looked toward Templeton. 1463296|1|20|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11625|He sat erect and rigid in his chair–his teeth chattered, and his eyes were starting from their sockets. 1463322|2|20|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']

11629|At length there seemed to pass a violent and sudden shock through my soul, as if of electricity. 1463617|1|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11630|But all these things I felt–not saw. 1463713|10|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11631|I took interest in nothing. 1463749|11|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11632|Even the corpse seemed a matter in which I had no concern. 1463776|12|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11633|Volition I had none, but appeared to be impelled into motion, and flitted buoyantly out of the city, retracing the circuitous path by which I had entered it. 1463834|13|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11634|When I had attained that point of the ravine in the mountains at which I had encountered the hyena, I again experienced a shock as of a galvanic battery, the sense of weight, of volition, of substance, returned. 1463991|14|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']

11637|This latter I felt–not saw. 1464455|3|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11638|In an instant I seemed to rise from the ground. 1464482|4|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11639|But I had no bodily, no visible, audible, or palpable presence. 1464529|5|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11640|The crowd had departed. 1464592|6|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11641|The tumult had ceased. 1464615|7|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11642|The city was in comparative repose. 1464637|8|21|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']

11646|Let us content ourselves with this supposition. 1465015|2|22|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11647|For the rest I have some explanation to make. 1465062|3|22|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11648|"Here is a watercolor drawing, which I should have shown you before, but which an unaccountable sentiment of horror has hitherto prevented me from showing"". 1465107"|4|22|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']

11650|I saw nothing in it of an extraordinary character, but its effect upon Bedloe was prodigious. 1465306|1|23|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11651|He nearly fainted as he gazed. 1465399|2|23|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11652|And yet it was but a miniature portrait–a miraculously accurate one, to be sure–of his own very remarkable features. 1465429|3|23|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11653|At least this was my thought as I regarded it. 1465545|4|23|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']

11655|In this year was the portrait taken. 1465704|1|24|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11656|It is the likeness of a dead friend–a Mr. Oldeb–to whom I became much attached at Calcutta, during the administration of Warren Hastings. 1465740|2|24|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']

11658|When I first saw you, Mr. Bedloe, at Saratoga, it was the miraculous similarity which existed between yourself and the painting which induced me to accost you, to seek your friendship, and to bring about those arrangements which resulted in my becoming your constant companion. 1465910|4|24|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11659|In accomplishing this point, I was urged partly, and perhaps principally, by a regretful memory of the deceased, but also, in part, by an uneasy, and not altogether horrorless curiosity respecting yourself. 1466187|5|24|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']

11664|Of this party I was one, and did all I could to prevent the rash and fatal sally of the officer who fell, in the crowded alleys, by the poisoned arrow of a Bengalee. 1466881|4|25|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']

11711|Very suddenly my attention was arrested by the loud beating of a drum. 1473045|5|8|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11712|"""My amazement was, of course, extreme. 1473115"|0|9|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']

11715|But a new and still more astounding source of interest and perplexity arose. 1473275|3|9|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11716|There came a wild rattling or jingling sound, as if of a bunch of large keys, and upon the instant a dusky-visaged and half-naked man rushed past me with a shriek. 1473351|4|9|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11717|He came so close to my person that I felt his hot breath upon my face. 1473514|5|9|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11718|He bore in one hand an instrument composed of an assemblage of steel rings, and shook them vigorously as he ran. 1473584|6|9|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11719|Scarcely had he disappeared in the mist before, panting after him, with open mouth and glaring eyes, there darted a huge beast. 1473696|7|9|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']
11720|I could not be mistaken in its character. 1473823|8|9|A Tale Of The Ragged Mountains|1844-04-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction, Adventure']

11729|I need not remind the reader that, from the long and weird catalogue of human miseries, I might have selected many individual instances more replete with essential suffering than any of these vast generalities of disaster. 1474843|1|1|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']

11732|He was forthwith conveyed to the nearest hospital, and there pronounced to be still living, although in an asphytic condition. 1475266|0|10|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11733|After some hours he revived, recognized individuals of his acquaintance, and, in broken sentences spoke of his agonies in the grave. 1475392|1|10|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11734|From what he related, it was clear that he must have been conscious of life for more than an hour, while inhumed, before lapsing into insensibility. 1475524|0|11|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11735|The grave was carelessly and loosely filled with an exceedingly porous soil; and thus some air was necessarily admitted. 1475672|1|11|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11736|He heard the footsteps of the crowd overhead, and endeavored to make himself heard in turn. 1475792|2|11|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11737|It was the tumult within the grounds of the cemetery, he said, which appeared to awaken him from a deep sleep, but no sooner was he awake than he became fully aware of the awful horrors of his position. 1475883|3|11|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']

11740|The mention of the galvanic battery, nevertheless, recalls to my memory a well known and very extraordinary case in point, where its action proved the means of restoring to animation a young attorney of London, who had been interred for two days. 1476371|0|13|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11741|The patient, Mr. Edward Stapleton, had died, apparently of typhus fever, accompanied with some anomalous symptoms which had excited the curiosity of his medical attendants. 1476617|0|14|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11742|Upon his seeming decease, his friends were requested to sanction a post-mortem examination, but declined to permit it. 1476789|1|14|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11743|As often happens, when such refusals are made, the practitioners resolved to disinter the body and dissect it at leisure, in private. 1476907|2|14|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11744|Arrangements were easily effected with some of the numerous corps of body-snatchers, with which London abounds; and, upon the third night after the funeral, the supposed corpse was unearthed from a grave eight feet deep, and deposited in the opening chamber of one of the private hospitals. 1477040|3|14|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']

11746|One experiment succeeded another, and the customary effects supervened, with nothing to characterize them in any respect, except, upon one or two occasions, a more than ordinary degree of life-likeness in the convulsive action. 1477491|1|15|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']

11749|A student, however, was especially desirous of testing a theory of his own, and insisted upon applying the battery to one of the pectoral muscles. 1477836|2|16|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11750|A rough gash was made, and a wire hastily brought in contact, when the patient, with a hurried but quite unconvulsive movement, arose from the table, stepped into the middle of the floor, gazed about him uneasily for a few seconds, and then–spoke. 1477982|3|16|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11751|What he said was unintelligible, but words were uttered; the syllabification was distinct. 1478229|4|16|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11752|Having spoken, he fell heavily to the floor. 1478319|5|16|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']

11755|Upon exhibition of ether he revived and was rapidly restored to health, and to the society of his friends–from whom, however, all knowledge of his resuscitation was withheld, until a relapse was no longer to be apprehended. 1478540|2|17|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11756|Their wonder–their rapturous astonishment–may be conceived. 1478763|3|17|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11757|The most thrilling peculiarity of this incident, nevertheless, is involved in what Mr. S. himself asserts. 1478822|0|18|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11758|He declares that at no period was he altogether insensible–that, dully and confusedly, he was aware of everything which happened to him, from the moment in which he was pronounced dead by his physicians, to that in which he fell swooning to the floor of the hospital. 1478928|1|18|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']

11761|When we reflect how very rarely, from the nature of the case, we have it in our power to detect them, we must admit that they may frequently occur without our cognizance. 1479510|1|19|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11762|Scarcely, in truth, is a graveyard ever encroached upon, for any purpose, to any great extent, that skeletons are not found in postures which suggest the most fearful of suspicions. 1479680|2|19|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']

11773|It may be asserted, without hesitation, that no event is so terribly well adapted to inspire the supremeness of bodily and of mental distress, as is burial before death. 1480765|1|20|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11774|The unendurable oppression of the lungs- the stifling fumes from the damp earth–the clinging to the death garments–the rigid embrace of the narrow house–the blackness of the absolute Night–the silence like a sea that overwhelms–the unseen but palpable presence of the Conqueror Worm–these things, with the thoughts of the air and grass above, with memory of dear friends who would fly to save us if but informed of our fate, and with consciousness that of this fate they can never be informed–that our hopeless portion is that of the really dead–these considerations, I say, carry into the heart, which still palpitates, a degree of appalling and intolerable horror from which the most daring imagination must recoil. 1480934|2|20|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11775|We know of nothing so agonizing upon Earth- we can dream of nothing half so hideous in the realms of the nethermost Hell. 1481651|3|20|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11776|And thus all narratives upon this topic have an interest profound; an interest, nevertheless, which, through the sacred awe of the topic itself, very properly and very peculiarly depends upon our conviction of the truth of the matter narrated. 1481772|4|20|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']

11778|For several years I had been subject to attacks of the singular disorder which physicians have agreed to term catalepsy, in default of a more definitive title. 1482112|0|21|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11779|Although both the immediate and the predisposing causes, and even the actual diagnosis, of this disease are still mysterious, its obvious and apparent character is sufficiently well understood. 1482271|1|21|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11780|In this lies the principal security from inhumation. 1482464|10|21|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11781|The unfortunate whose first attack should be of the extreme character which is occasionally seen, would almost inevitably be consigned alive to the tomb. 1482516|11|21|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11782|Its variations seem to be chiefly of degree. 1482669|2|21|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11783|Sometimes the patient lies, for a day only, or even for a shorter period, in a species of exaggerated lethargy. 1482713|3|21|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11784|He is senseless and externally motionless; but the pulsation of the heart is still faintly perceptible; some traces of warmth remain; a slight color lingers within the centre of the cheek; and, upon application of a mirror to the lips, we can detect a torpid, unequal, and vacillating action of the lungs. 1482824|4|21|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11785|Then again the duration of the trance is for weeks–even for months; while the closest scrutiny, and the most rigorous medical tests, fail to establish any material distinction between the state of the sufferer and what we conceive of absolute death. 1483129|5|21|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11786|Very usually he is saved from premature interment solely by the knowledge of his friends that he has been previously subject to catalepsy, by the consequent suspicion excited, and, above all, by the non-appearance of decay. 1483378|6|21|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11787|The advances of the malady are, luckily, gradual. 1483601|7|21|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11788|The first manifestations, although marked, are unequivocal. 1483650|8|21|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11789|The fits grow successively more and more distinctive, and endure each for a longer term than the preceding. 1483709|9|21|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']

11791|Sometimes, without any apparent cause, I sank, little by little, into a condition of hemi-syncope, or half swoon; and, in this condition, without pain, without ability to stir, or, strictly speaking, to think, but with a dull lethargic consciousness of life and of the presence of those who surrounded my bed, I remained, until the crisis of the disease restored me, suddenly, to perfect sensation. 1483902|1|22|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11792|At other times I was quickly and impetuously smitten. 1484300|2|22|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11793|I grew sick, and numb, and chilly, and dizzy, and so fell prostrate at once. 1484353|3|22|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11794|Then, for weeks, all was void, and black, and silent, and Nothing became the universe. 1484429|4|22|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11795|Total annihilation could be no more. 1484515|5|22|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11796|From these latter attacks I awoke, however, with a gradation slow in proportion to the suddenness of the seizure. 1484551|6|22|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11797|Just as the day dawns to the friendless and houseless beggar who roams the streets throughout the long desolate winter night–just so tardily- just so wearily–just so cheerily came back the light of the Soul to me. 1484664|7|22|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11798|Apart from the tendency to trance, however, my general health appeared to be good; nor could I perceive that it was at all affected by the one prevalent malady–unless, indeed, an idiosyncrasy in my ordinary sleep may be looked upon as superinduced. 1484877|0|23|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11799|Upon awaking from slumber, I could never gain, at once, thorough possession of my senses, and always remained, for many minutes, in much bewilderment and perplexity;–the mental faculties in general, but the memory in especial, being in a condition of absolute abeyance. 1485125|1|23|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']

11802|I was lost in reveries of death, and the idea of premature burial held continual possession of my brain. 1485551|2|24|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11803|The ghastly Danger to which I was subjected haunted me day and night. 1485655|3|24|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11804|In the former, the torture of meditation was excessive–in the latter, supreme. 1485724|4|24|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11805|When the grim Darkness overspread the Earth, then, with every horror of thought, I shook–shook as the quivering plumes upon the hearse. 1485802|5|24|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11806|When Nature could endure wakefulness no longer, it was with a struggle that I consented to sleep–for I shuddered to reflect that, upon awaking, I might find myself the tenant of a grave. 1485937|6|24|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11807|And when, finally, I sank into slumber, it was only to rush at once into a world of phantasms, above which, with vast, sable, overshadowing wing, hovered, predominant, the one sepulchral Idea. 1486123|7|24|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']

11811|within my ear. 1486631|3|25|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11812|I sat erect. 1486645|0|26|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11813|The darkness was total. 1486657|1|26|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11814|I could not see the figure of him who had aroused me. 1486680|2|26|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11815|I could call to mind neither the period at which I had fAllan into the trance, nor the locality in which I then lay. 1486733|3|26|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11816|"""Arise! 1486849"|0|27|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']

11819|"""I have no name in the regions which I inhabit,"" replied the voice, mournfully; ""I was mortal, but am fiend. 1486916"|0|29|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11820|I was merciless, but am pitiful. 1487024|1|29|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11821|Is not this a spectacle of woe? 1487056|10|29|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11822|"–Behold""! 1487087"|11|29|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11823|Thou dost feel that I shudder. 1487096|2|29|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11824|–My teeth chatter as I speak, yet it is not with the chilliness of the night–of the night without end. 1487126|3|29|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11825|But this hideousness is insufferable. 1487228|4|29|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11826|How canst thou tranquilly sleep? 1487265|5|29|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11827|I cannot rest for the cry of these great agonies. 1487297|6|29|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11828|These sights are more than I can bear. 1487346|7|29|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11829|Get thee up! 1487384|8|29|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11830|Come with me into the outer Night, and let me unfold to thee the graves. 1487396|9|29|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11831|Apart, however, from the inevitable conclusion, a priori that such causes must produce such effects–that the well-known occurrence of such cases of suspended animation must naturally give rise, now and then, to premature interments–apart from this consideration, we have the direct testimony of medical and ordinary experience to prove that a vast number of such interments have actually taken place. 1487468|0|3|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11832|I might refer at once, if necessary to a hundred well authenticated instances. 1487868|1|3|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11833|There was no warmth. 1487946|10|3|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11834|Pulsation had ceased. 1487966|11|3|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11835|For three days the body was preserved unburied, during which it had acquired a stony rigidity. 1487987|12|3|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11836|The funeral, in short, was hastened, on account of the rapid advance of what was supposed to be decomposition. 1488081|13|3|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11837|One of very remarkable character, and of which the circumstances may be fresh in the memory of some of my readers, occurred, not very long ago, in the neighboring city of Baltimore, where it occasioned a painful, intense, and widely-extended excitement. 1488191|2|3|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11838|The wife of one of the most respectable citizens-a lawyer of eminence and a member of Congress–was seized with a sudden and unaccountable illness, which completely baffled the skill of her physicians. 1488444|3|3|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11839|After much suffering she died, or was supposed to die. 1488644|4|3|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11840|No one suspected, indeed, or had reason to suspect, that she was not actually dead. 1488698|5|3|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11841|She presented all the ordinary appearances of death. 1488781|6|3|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11842|The face assumed the usual pinched and sunken outline. 1488833|7|3|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11843|The lips were of the usual marble pallor. 1488887|8|3|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11844|The eyes were lustreless. 1488928|9|3|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11845|I looked; and the unseen figure, which still grasped me by the wrist, had caused to be thrown open the graves of all mankind, and from each issued the faint phosphoric radiance of decay, so that I could see into the innermost recesses, and there view the shrouded bodies in their sad and solemn slumbers with the worm. 1488953|0|30|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11846|But alas! 1489271|1|30|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11847|the real sleepers were fewer, by many millions, than those who slumbered not at all; and there was a feeble struggling; and there was a general sad unrest; and from out the depths of the countless pits there came a melancholy rustling from the garments of the buried. 1489280|2|30|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11848|And of those who seemed tranquilly to repose, I saw that a vast number had changed, in a greater or less degree, the rigid and uneasy position in which they had originally been entombed. 1489547|3|30|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11849|"""Is it not–oh! 1489733"|0|31|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11850|"is it not a pitiful sight""? 1489747"|1|31|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11851|"–but, before I could find words to reply, the figure had ceased to grasp my wrist, the phosphoric lights expired, and the graves were closed with a sudden violence, while from out them arose a tumult of despairing cries, saying again: ""Is it not–O, God, is it not a very pitiful sight""? 1489774"|2|31|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11852|Phantasies such as these, presenting themselves at night, extended their terrific influence far into my waking hours. 1490060|0|32|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11853|My nerves became thoroughly unstrung, and I fell a prey to perpetual horror. 1490177|1|32|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11854|I entered into a series of elaborate precautions. 1490253|10|32|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11855|Among other things, I had the family vault so remodelled as to admit of being readily opened from within. 1490302|11|32|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11856|The slightest pressure upon a long lever that extended far into the tomb would cause the iron portal to fly back. 1490407|12|32|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11857|There were arrangements also for the free admission of air and light, and convenient receptacles for food and water, within immediate reach of the coffin intended for my reception. 1490520|13|32|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11858|This coffin was warmly and softly padded, and was provided with a lid, fashioned upon the principle of the vault-door, with the addition of springs so contrived that the feeblest movement of the body would be sufficient to set it at liberty. 1490700|14|32|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11859|Besides all this, there was suspended from the roof of the tomb, a large bell, the rope of which, it was designed, should extend through a hole in the coffin, and so be fastened to one of the hands of the corpse. 1490941|15|32|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11860|But, alas? 1491153|16|32|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11861|what avails the vigilance against the Destiny of man? 1491163|17|32|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11862|Not even these well-contrived securities sufficed to save from the uttermost agonies of living inhumation, a wretch to these agonies foredoomed! 1491216|18|32|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11863|I hesitated to ride, or to walk, or to indulge in any exercise that would carry me from home. 1491360|2|32|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11864|In fact, I no longer dared trust myself out of the immediate presence of those who were aware of my proneness to catalepsy, lest, falling into one of my usual fits, I should be buried before my real condition could be ascertained. 1491453|3|32|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11865|I doubted the care, the fidelity of my dearest friends. 1491683|4|32|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11866|I dreaded that, in some trance of more than customary duration, they might be prevailed upon to regard me as irrecoverable. 1491738|5|32|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11867|I even went so far as to fear that, as I occasioned much trouble, they might be glad to consider any very protracted attack as sufficient excuse for getting rid of me altogether. 1491861|6|32|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11868|It was in vain they endeavored to reassure me by the most solemn promises. 1492039|7|32|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11869|I exacted the most sacred oaths, that under no circumstances they would bury me until decomposition had so materially advanced as to render farther preservation impossible. 1492113|8|32|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11870|And, even then, my mortal terrors would listen to no reason–would accept no consolation. 1492285|9|32|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11871|There arrived an epoch–as often before there had arrived–in which I found myself emerging from total unconsciousness into the first feeble and indefinite sense of existence. 1492373|0|33|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11872|Slowly–with a tortoise gradation–approached the faint gray dawn of the psychal day. 1492546|1|33|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11873|And now the memory has so far regained its dominion, that, in some measure, I am cognizant of my state. 1492629|10|33|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11874|I feel that I am not awaking from ordinary sleep. 1492732|11|33|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11875|I recollect that I have been subject to catalepsy. 1492781|12|33|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11876|And now, at last, as if by the rush of an ocean, my shuddering spirit is overwhelmed by the one grim Danger–by the one spectral and ever-prevalent idea. 1492831|13|33|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11877|A torpid uneasiness. 1492983|2|33|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11878|An apathetic endurance of dull pain. 1493003|3|33|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11879|No care- no hope–no effort. 1493039|4|33|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11880|Then, after a long interval, a ringing in the ears; then, after a lapse still longer, a prickling or tingling sensation in the extremities; then a seemingly eternal period of pleasurable quiescence, during which the awakening feelings are struggling into thought; then a brief re-sinking into non-entity; then a sudden recovery. 1493066|5|33|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11881|At length the slight quivering of an eyelid, and immediately thereupon, an electric shock of a terror, deadly and indefinite, which sends the blood in torrents from the temples to the heart. 1493394|6|33|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11882|And now the first positive effort to think. 1493584|7|33|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11883|And now the first endeavor to remember. 1493627|8|33|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11884|And now a partial and evanescent success. 1493666|9|33|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11885|For some minutes after this fancy possessed me, I remained without motion. 1493707|0|34|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11886|And why? 1493781|1|34|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11887|I could not summon courage to move. 1493789|2|34|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11888|I dared not make the effort which was to satisfy me of my fate–and yet there was something at my heart which whispered me it was sure. 1493824|3|34|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11889|Despair- such as no other species of wretchedness ever calls into being- despair alone urged me, after long irresolution, to uplift the heavy lids of my eyes. 1493958|4|34|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11890|I uplifted them. 1494116|5|34|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11891|It was dark–all dark. 1494132|6|34|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11892|I knew that the fit was over. 1494153|7|34|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11893|I knew that the crisis of my disorder had long passed. 1494182|8|34|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11894|I knew that I had now fully recovered the use of my visual faculties–and yet it was dark–all dark–the intense and utter raylessness of the Night that endureth for evermore. 1494236|9|34|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11895|I endeavored to shriek-, and my lips and my parched tongue moved convulsively together in the attempt–but no voice issued from the cavernous lungs, which oppressed as if by the weight of some incumbent mountain, gasped and palpitated, with the heart, at every elaborate and struggling inspiration. 1494408|0|35|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11896|The movement of the jaws, in this effort to cry aloud, showed me that they were bound up, as is usual with the dead. 1494705|0|36|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11897|I felt, too, that I lay upon some hard substance, and by something similar my sides were, also, closely compressed. 1494821|1|36|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11898|So far, I had not ventured to stir any of my limbs–but now I violently threw up my arms, which had been lying at length, with the wrists crossed. 1494936|2|36|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11899|They struck a solid wooden substance, which extended above my person at an elevation of not more than six inches from my face. 1495081|3|36|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11900|I could no longer doubt that I reposed within a coffin at last. 1495207|4|36|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11901|And now, amid all my infinite miseries, came sweetly the cherub Hope–for I thought of my precautions. 1495270|0|37|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11902|I writhed, and made spasmodic exertions to force open the lid: it would not move. 1495371|1|37|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11903|I felt my wrists for the bell-rope: it was not to be found. 1495452|2|37|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11904|And now the Comforter fled for ever, and a still sterner Despair reigned triumphant; for I could not help perceiving the absence of the paddings which I had so carefully prepared–and then, too, there came suddenly to my nostrils the strong peculiar odor of moist earth. 1495511|3|37|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11905|The conclusion was irresistible. 1495780|4|37|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11906|I was not within the vault. 1495812|5|37|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11907|I had fAllan into a trance while absent from home-while among strangers–when, or how, I could not remember–and it was they who had buried me as a dog–nailed up in some common coffin–and thrust deep, deep, and for ever, into some ordinary and nameless grave. 1495839|6|37|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11908|As this awful conviction forced itself, thus, into the innermost chambers of my soul, I once again struggled to cry aloud. 1496096|0|38|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11909|And in this second endeavor I succeeded. 1496218|1|38|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11910|A long, wild, and continuous shriek, or yell of agony, resounded through the realms of the subterranean Night. 1496258|2|38|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11911|"""Hillo! 1496368"|0|39|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']

11913|said a gruff voice, in reply. 1496389|2|39|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11914|The lady was deposited in her family vault, which, for three subsequent years, was undisturbed. 1496418|0|4|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11915|At the expiration of this term it was opened for the reception of a sarcophagus;–but, alas! 1496513|1|4|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11916|how fearful a shock awaited the husband, who, personally, threw open the door! 1496604|2|4|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11917|As its portals swung outwardly back, some white-apparelled object fell rattling within his arms. 1496682|3|4|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11918|It was the skeleton of his wife in her yet unmoulded shroud. 1496778|4|4|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11919|"""What the devil's the matter now""! 1496838"|0|40|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11920|said a second. 1496872|1|40|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']

11923|"""What do you mean by yowling in that ere kind of style, like a cattymount""? 1496917"|0|42|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11924|said a fourth; and hereupon I was seized and shaken without ceremony, for several minutes, by a junto of very rough-looking individuals. 1496992|1|42|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11925|They did not arouse me from my slumber–for I was wide awake when I screamed–but they restored me to the full possession of my memory. 1497128|2|42|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11926|This adventure occurred near Richmond, in Virginia. 1497261|0|43|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11927|Accompanied by a friend, I had proceeded, upon a gunning expedition, some miles down the banks of the James River. 1497312|1|43|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11928|Nevertheless, I slept soundly, and the whole of my vision–for it was no dream, and no nightmare–arose naturally from the circumstances of my position–from my ordinary bias of thought–and from the difficulty, to which I have alluded, of collecting my senses, and especially of regaining my memory, for a long time after awaking from slumber. 1497426|10|43|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11929|The men who shook me were the crew of the sloop, and some laborers engaged to unload it. 1497766|11|43|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11930|From the load itself came the earthly smell. 1497854|12|43|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11931|The bandage about the jaws was a silk handkerchief in which I had bound up my head, in default of my customary nightcap. 1497898|13|43|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11932|Night approached, and we were overtaken by a storm. 1498018|2|43|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11933|The cabin of a small sloop lying at anchor in the stream, and laden with garden mould, afforded us the only available shelter. 1498069|3|43|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11934|We made the best of it, and passed the night on board. 1498195|4|43|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11935|I slept in one of the only two berths in the vessel–and the berths of a sloop of sixty or twenty tons need scarcely be described. 1498249|5|43|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11936|That which I occupied had no bedding of any kind. 1498378|6|43|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11937|Its extreme width was eighteen inches. 1498427|7|43|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11938|The distance of its bottom from the deck overhead was precisely the same. 1498465|8|43|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11939|I found it a matter of exceeding difficulty to squeeze myself in. 1498538|9|43|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11940|The tortures endured, however, were indubitably quite equal for the time, to those of actual sepulture. 1498603|0|44|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11941|They were fearfully–they were inconceivably hideous; but out of Evil proceeded Good; for their very excess wrought in my spirit an inevitable revulsion. 1498706|1|44|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11942|In short, I became a new man, and lived a man's life. 1498858|10|44|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11943|From that memorable night, I dismissed forever my charnel apprehensions, and with them vanished the cataleptic disorder, of which, perhaps, they had been less the consequence than the cause. 1498911|11|44|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11944|My soul acquired tone–acquired temper. 1499101|2|44|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11945|I went abroad. 1499139|3|44|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11946|I took vigorous exercise. 1499153|4|44|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11947|I breathed the free air of Heaven. 1499178|5|44|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11948|I thought upon other subjects than Death. 1499212|6|44|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11949|I discarded my medical books. 1499253|7|44|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11950|"""Buchan"" I burned. 1499282"|8|44|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']

11952|There are moments when, even to the sober eye of Reason, the world of our sad Humanity may assume the semblance of a Hell–but the imagination of man is no Carathis, to explore with impunity its every cavern. 1499386|0|45|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11953|Alas! 1499593|1|45|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11954|the grim legion of sepulchral terrors cannot be regarded as altogether fanciful–but, like the Demons in whose company Afrasiab made his voyage down the Oxus, they must sleep, or they will devour us–they must be suffered to slumber, or we perish. 1499598|2|45|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11955|A careful investigation rendered it evident that she had revived within two days after her entombment; that her struggles within the coffin had caused it to fall from a ledge, or shelf to the floor, where it was so broken as to permit her escape. 1499843|0|5|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11956|A lamp which had been accidentally left, full of oil, within the tomb, was found empty; it might have been exhausted, however, by evaporation. 1500089|1|5|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11957|On the uttermost of the steps which led down into the dread chamber was a large fragment of the coffin, with which, it seemed, that she had endeavored to arrest attention by striking the iron door. 1500231|2|5|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11958|While thus occupied, she probably swooned, or possibly died, through sheer terror; and, in failing, her shroud became entangled in some iron- work which projected interiorly. 1500428|3|5|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11959|Thus she remained, and thus she rotted, erect. 1500602|4|5|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11960|In the year 1810, a case of living inhumation happened in France, attended with circumstances which go far to warrant the assertion that truth is, indeed, stranger than fiction. 1500648|0|6|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11961|The heroine of the story was a Mademoiselle Victorine Lafourcade, a young girl of illustrious family, of wealth, and of great personal beauty. 1500825|1|6|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11962|In fact, the lady had been buried alive. 1500967|10|6|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11963|Vitality had not altogether departed, and she was aroused by the caresses of her lover from the lethargy which had been mistaken for death. 1501007|11|6|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11964|He bore her frantically to his lodgings in the village. 1501146|12|6|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11965|He employed certain powerful restoratives suggested by no little medical learning. 1501201|13|6|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11966|In fine, she revived. 1501283|14|6|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11967|She recognized her preserver. 1501304|15|6|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11968|She remained with him until, by slow degrees, she fully recovered her original health. 1501333|16|6|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11969|Her woman's heart was not adamant, and this last lesson of love sufficed to soften it. 1501419|17|6|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11970|She bestowed it upon Bossuet. 1501505|18|6|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11971|She returned no more to her husband, but, concealing from him her resurrection, fled with her lover to America. 1501534|19|6|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11972|Among her numerous suitors was Julien Bossuet, a poor litterateur, or journalist of Paris. 1501645|2|6|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11973|Twenty years afterward, the two returned to France, in the persuasion that time had so greatly altered the lady's appearance that her friends would be unable to recognize her. 1501735|20|6|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11974|They were mistaken, however, for, at the first meeting, Monsieur Renelle did actually recognize and make claim to his wife. 1501910|21|6|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11975|This claim she resisted, and a judicial tribunal sustained her in her resistance, deciding that the peculiar circumstances, with the long lapse of years, had extinguished, not only equitably, but legally, the authority of the husband. 1502033|22|6|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11976|His talents and general amiability had recommended him to the notice of the heiress, by whom he seems to have been truly beloved; but her pride of birth decided her, finally, to reject him, and to wed a Monsieur Renelle, a banker and a diplomatist of some eminence. 1502267|3|6|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11977|After marriage, however, this gentleman neglected, and, perhaps, even more positively ill-treated her. 1502532|4|6|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11978|Having passed with him some wretched years, she died,–at least her condition so closely resembled death as to deceive every one who saw her. 1502634|5|6|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11979|She was buried–not in a vault, but in an ordinary grave in the village of her nativity. 1502774|6|6|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11980|Filled with despair, and still inflamed by the memory of a profound attachment, the lover journeys from the capital to the remote province in which the village lies, with the romantic purpose of disinterring the corpse, and possessing himself of its luxuriant tresses. 1502861|7|6|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11981|He reaches the grave. 1503129|8|6|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11982|At midnight he unearths the coffin, opens it, and is in the act of detaching the hair, when he is arrested by the unclosing of the beloved eyes. 1503150|9|6|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11983|"The ""Chirurgical Journal"" of Leipsic–a periodical of high authority and merit, which some American bookseller would do well to translate and republish, records in a late number a very distressing event of the character in question. 1503294"|0|7|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11984|An officer of artillery, a man of gigantic stature and of robust health, being thrown from an unmanageable horse, received a very severe contusion upon the head, which rendered him insensible at once; the skull was slightly fractured, but no immediate danger was apprehended. 1503525|0|8|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11985|Trepanning was accomplished successfully. 1503800|1|8|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11986|He was bled, and many other of the ordinary means of relief were adopted. 1503841|2|8|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11987|Gradually, however, he fell into a more and more hopeless state of stupor, and, finally, it was thought that he died. 1503914|3|8|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11988|The weather was warm, and he was buried with indecent haste in one of the public cemeteries. 1504031|0|9|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11989|His funeral took place on Thursday. 1504123|1|9|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11990|On the Sunday following, the grounds of the cemetery were, as usual, much thronged with visiters, and about noon an intense excitement was created by the declaration of a peasant that, while sitting upon the grave of the officer, he had distinctly felt a commotion of the earth, as if occasioned by some one struggling beneath. 1504158|2|9|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11991|At first little attention was paid to the man's asseveration; but his evident terror, and the dogged obstinacy with which he persisted in his story, had at length their natural effect upon the crowd. 1504485|3|9|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11992|Spades were hurriedly procured, and the grave, which was shamefully shallow, was in a few minutes so far thrown open that the head of its occupant appeared. 1504684|4|9|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']
11993|He was then seemingly dead; but he sat nearly erect within his coffin, the lid of which, in his furious struggles, he had partially uplifted. 1504840|5|9|The Premature Burial|1844-07-31 00:00:00|['Horror']

11996|There can be no more absolute waste of time than the attempt to prove, at the present day, that man, by mere exercise of will can so impress his fellow as to cast him into an abnormal condition, of which the phenomena resemble very closely those of death, or at least resemble them more nearly than they do the phenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance; that, while in this state, the person so impressed employs only with effort, and then feebly, the external organs of sense, yet perceives, with keenly refined perception, and through channels supposed unknown, matters beyond the scope of the physical organs; that, moreover, his intellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and invigorated; that his sympathies with the person so impressing him are profound, and, finally, that his susceptibility to the impression increases with its frequency, while in the same proportion, the peculiar phenomena elicited are more extended and more pronounced. 1505208|2|0|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']

12046|These gradations of matter increase in rarity or fineness until we arrive at a matter unparticled–without particles–indivisible-one, and here the law of impulsion and permeation is modified. 1509087|7|34|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']

12052|The unparticled matter, or God, in quiescence is (as nearly as we can conceive it) what men call mind. 1509644|2|36|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12053|And the power of self-movement (equivalent in effect to human volition) is, in the unparticled matter, the result of its unity and omniprevalence; how, I know not, and now clearly see that I shall never know. 1509746|3|36|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12054|But the unparticled matter, set in motion by a law or quality existing within itself, is thinking. 1509954|4|36|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12055|P. Can you give me no more precise idea of what you term the unparticled matter? 1510052|0|37|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12056|V. The matters of which man is cognizant escape the senses in gradation. 1510132|0|38|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12057|We have, for example, a metal, a piece of wood, a drop of water, the atmosphere, a gas, caloric, electricity, the luminiferous ether. 1510204|1|38|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12058|But the consideration of the atomic constitution being now taken away, the nature of the mass inevitably glides into what we conceive of spirit. 1510337|10|38|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12059|It is clear, however, that it is as fully matter as before. 1510481|11|38|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12060|The truth is, it is impossible to conceive spirit since it is impossible to imagine what is not. 1510540|12|38|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12061|When we flatter ourselves that we have formed its conception, we have merely deceived our understanding by the consideration of infinitely rarefied matter. 1510636|13|38|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12062|Now, we call all these things matter, and embrace all matter in one general definition; but in spite of this, there can be no two ideas more essentially distinct than that which we attach to a metal, and that which we attach to the luminiferous ether. 1510791|2|38|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12063|When we reach the latter, we feel an almost irresistible inclination to class it with spirit, or with nihilty. 1511042|3|38|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12064|The only consideration which restrains us is our conception of its atomic constitution; and here, even, we have to seek aid from our notion of an atom, as something possessing in infinite minuteness, solidity, palpability, weight. 1511152|4|38|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12065|Destroy the idea of the atomic constitution and we should no longer be able to regard the ether as an entity, or, at least, as matter. 1511382|5|38|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12066|For want of a better word we might term it spirit. 1511516|6|38|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12067|Take, now, a step beyond the luminiferous ether–conceive a matter as much more rare than the ether, as this ether is more rare than the metal, and we arrive at once (in spite of all the school dogmas) at a unique mass- an unparticled matter. 1511566|7|38|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12068|For although we may admit infinite littleness in the atoms themselves, the infinitude of littleness in the spaces between them is an absurdity. 1511807|8|38|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12069|There will be a point–there will be a degree of rarity at which, if the atoms are sufficiently numerous, the interspaces must vanish, and the mass absolutely coalesce. 1511950|9|38|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12070|P. There seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea of absolute coalescence;–and that is the very slight resistance experienced by the heavenly bodies in their revolutions through space- a resistance now ascertained, it is true, to exist in some degree, but which is, nevertheless, so slight as to have been quite overlooked by the sagacity even of Newton. 1512117|0|39|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12071|We know that the resistance of bodies is, chiefly, in proportion to their density. 1512482|1|39|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12072|Absolute coalescence is absolute density. 1512564|2|39|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12073|Where there are no interspaces, there can be no yielding. 1512605|3|39|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12074|An ether, absolutely dense, would put an infinitely more effectual stop to the progress of a star than would an ether of adamant or of iron. 1512662|4|39|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12075|As I entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile, and although evidently in much bodily pain, appeared to be, mentally, quite at ease. 1512802|0|4|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12076|V. Your objection is answered with an ease which is nearly in the ratio of its apparent unanswerability. 1512945|0|40|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12077|–As regards the progress of the star, it can make no difference whether the star passes through the ether or the ether through it. 1513049|1|40|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12078|There is no astronomical error more unaccountable than that which reconciles the known retardation of the comets with the idea of their passage through an ether, for, however rare this ether be supposed, it would put a stop to all sidereal revolution in a very far briefer period than has been admitted by those astronomers who have endeavored to slur over a point which they found it impossible to comprehend. 1513179|2|40|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12079|The retardation actually experienced is, on the other hand, about that which might be expected from the friction of the ether in the instantaneous passage through the orb. 1513589|3|40|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12080|In the one case, the retarding force is momentary and complete within itself–in the other it is endlessly accumulative. 1513760|4|40|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12081|P. But in all this–in this identification of mere matter with God–is there nothing of irreverence? 1513879|0|41|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12082|[I was forced to repeat this question before the sleep-waker fully comprehended my meaning. 1513977|1|41|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']

12101|In his summing up it seemed evident to me that the reasoner had not even succeeded in convincing himself. 1515411|11|5|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']

12106|The will may assent–the soul–the intellect, never. 1516035|16|5|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12107|I cannot deny that there has always existed, as if in that very soul which I have been denying, a vague half-sentiment of its own existence. 1516085|2|5|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12108|But this half-sentiment at no time amounted to conviction. 1516225|3|5|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']

12144|I cannot better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that the mesmeric exaltation enables me to perceive a train of ratiocination which, in my abnormal existence, convinces, but which, in full accordance with the mesmeric phenomena, does not extend, except through its effect, into my normal condition. 1518383|3|6|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12145|In sleep-waking, the reasoning and its conclusion–the cause and its effect–are present together. 1518690|4|6|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12146|In my natural state, the cause vanishes, the effect only, and perhaps only partially, remains. 1518786|5|6|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12147|V. We, certainly–but not the worm. 1518880|0|60|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12148|The matter of which our rudimental body is composed, is within the ken of the organs of that body; or, more distinctly, our rudimental organs are adapted to the matter of which is formed the rudimental body, but not to that of which the ultimate is composed. 1518914|1|60|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12149|The ultimate body thus escapes our rudimental senses, and we perceive only the shell which falls, in decaying, from the inner form, not that inner form itself; but this inner form as well as the shell, is appreciable by those who have already acquired the ultimate life. 1519172|2|60|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12150|P. You have often said that the mesmeric state very nearly resembles death. 1519442|0|61|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12151|How is this? 1519517|1|61|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12152|V. When I say that it resembles death, I mean that it resembles the ultimate life; for when I am entranced the senses of my rudimental life are in abeyance and I perceive external things directly, without organs, through a medium which I shall employ in the ultimate, unorganized life. 1519529|0|62|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12153|P. Unorganized? 1519814|0|63|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12154|V. Yes; organs are contrivances by which the individual is brought into sensible relation with particular classes and forms of matter, to the exclusion of other classes and forms. 1519829|0|64|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12155|The organs of man are adapted to his rudimental condition, and to that only; his ultimate condition, being unorganized, is of unlimited comprehension in all points but one–the nature of the volition of God–that is to say, the motion of the unparticled matter. 1520008|1|64|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12156|It is to the absence of idiosyncratic organs, therefore, that we must attribute the nearly unlimited perception of the ultimate life. 1520267|10|64|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12157|To rudimental beings, organs are the cages necessary to confine them until fledged. 1520400|11|64|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12158|You may have a distinct idea of the ultimate body by conceiving it to be entire brain. 1520483|2|64|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12159|This it is not, but a conception of this nature will bring you near a comprehension of what it is. 1520569|3|64|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12160|A luminous body imparts vibration to the luminiferous ether. 1520667|4|64|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12161|The vibrations generate similar ones within the retina; these again communicate similar ones to the optic nerve. 1520727|5|64|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12162|The nerve conveys similar ones to the brain; the brain, also, similar ones to the unparticled matter which permeates it. 1520839|6|64|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12163|The motion of this latter is thought, of which perception is the first undulation. 1520959|7|64|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12164|This is the mode by which the mind of the rudimental life communicates with the external world; and this external world is, to the rudimental life, limited, through the idiosyncrasy of its organs. 1521041|8|64|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12165|But in the ultimate, unorganized life, the external world reaches the whole body, (which is of a substance having affinity to brain, as I have said,) with no other intervention than that of an infinitely rarer ether than even the luminiferous; and to this ether–in unison with it–the whole body vibrates, setting in motion the unparticled matter which permeates it. 1521237|9|64|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12166|"P. You speak of rudimental ""beings"". 1521602"|0|65|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12167|Are there other rudimental thinking beings than man? 1521638|1|65|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12168|V. The multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebulae, planets, suns, and other bodies which are neither nebulae, suns, nor planets, is for the sole purpose of supplying pabulum for the idiosyncrasy of the organs of an infinity of rudimental beings. 1521690|0|66|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12169|But for the necessity of the rudimental, prior to the ultimate life, there would have been no bodies such as these. 1521949|1|66|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12170|Each of these is tenanted by a distinct variety of organic rudimental thinking creatures. 1522064|2|66|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12171|In all, the organs vary with the features of the place tenanted. 1522153|3|66|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12172|At death, or metamorphosis, these creatures, enjoying the ultimate life–immortality–and cognizant of all secrets but the one, act all things and pass every where by mere volition:–indwelling, not the stars, which to us seem the sole palpabilities, and for the accommodation of which we blindly deem space created–but that space itself–that infinity of which the truly substantive vastness swallows up the star-shadows–blotting them out as non-entities from the perception of the angels. 1522217|4|66|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12173|"P. You say that ""but for the necessity of the rudimental life, there would have been no stars"". 1522703"|0|67|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12174|But why this necessity? 1522798|1|67|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12175|V. In the inorganic life, as well as in the inorganic matter generally, there is nothing to impede the action of one simple unique law–the Divine Volition. 1522821|0|68|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12176|With the view of producing impediment, the organic life and matter (complex, substantial and law- encumbered) were contrived. 1522976|1|68|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12177|P. But again–why need this impediment have been produced? 1523101|0|69|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12178|"""These considerations have led me to think that some good results might ensue from a series of well-directed questions propounded to me while mesmerized. 1523158"|0|7|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12179|"You have often observed the profound self-cognizance evinced by the sleep-waker–the extensive knowledge he displays upon all points relating to the mesmeric condition itself, and from this self-cognizance may be deduced hints for the proper conduct of a catechism"". 1523311"|1|7|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12180|V. The result of law inviolate is perfection–right–negative happiness. 1523576|0|70|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12181|The result of law violate is imperfection, wrong, positive pain. 1523646|1|70|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12182|Through the impediments afforded by the number, complexity, and substantiality of the laws of organic life and matter, the violation of law is rendered, to a certain extent, practicable. 1523710|2|70|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12183|Thus pain, which is the inorganic life is impossible, is possible in the organic. 1523896|3|70|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12184|P. But to what good end is pain thus rendered possible? 1523977|0|71|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12185|V. All things are either good or bad by comparison. 1524032|0|72|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12186|A sufficient analysis will show that pleasure in all cases, is but the contrast of pain. 1524083|1|72|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12187|Positive pleasure is a mere idea. 1524171|2|72|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12188|To be happy at any one point we must have suffered at the same. 1524204|3|72|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12189|Never to suffer would have been never to have been blessed. 1524267|4|72|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12190|But it has been shown that, in the inorganic life, pain cannot be; thus the necessity for the organic. 1524326|5|72|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12191|The pain of the primitive life of Earth, is the sole basis of the bliss of the ultimate life in Heaven. 1524428|6|72|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12192|"P. Still there is one of your expressions which I find it impossible to comprehend–""the truly substantive vastness of infinity"". 1524531"|0|73|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12193|"V. This, probably, is because you have no sufficiently generic conception of the term ""substance"" itself. 1524659"|0|74|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12194|We must not regard it as a quality, but as a sentiment:–it is the perception, in thinking beings, of the adaptation of matter to their organization. 1524764|1|74|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12195|There are many things on the Earth, which would be nihility to the inhabitants of Venus–many things visible and tangible in Venus, which we could not be brought to appreciate as existing at all. 1524912|2|74|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12196|"But to the inorganic beings–to the angels–the whole of the unparticled matter is substance; that is to say, the whole of what we term ""space,"" is to them the truest substantiality;–the stars, meantime, through what we consider their materiality, escaping the angelic sense, just in proportion as the unparticled matter, through what we consider its immateriality, eludes the organic. 1525106"|3|74|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12197|As the sleep-waker pronounced these latter words, in a feeble tone, I observed on his countenance a singular expression, which somewhat alarmed me, and induced me to awake him at once. 1525489|0|75|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12198|No sooner had I done this than, with a bright smile irradiating all his features, he fell back upon his pillow and expired. 1525673|1|75|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12199|I noticed that in less than a minute afterward his corpse had all the stern rigidity of stone. 1525796|2|75|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12200|His brow was of the coldness of ice. 1525890|3|75|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12201|Thus, ordinarily, should it have appeared, only after long pressure from Azrael's hand. 1525926|4|75|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12202|Had the sleep-waker, indeed, during the latter portion of his discourse, been addressing me from out the regions of the shadows? 1526013|5|75|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12203|I consented of course to make this experiment. 1526141|0|8|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12204|A few passes threw Mr. Vankirk into the mesmeric sleep. 1526187|1|8|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12205|His breathing became immediately more easy, and he seemed to suffer no physical uneasiness. 1526242|2|8|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12206|The following conversation then ensued:-V. 1526333|3|8|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12207|in the dialogue representing the patient, and P. myself. 1526375|4|8|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12208|P. Are you asleep? 1526431|0|9|Mesmeric Revelation|1844-08-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
12209|"SOME YEARS ago, I engaged passage from Charleston, S. C, to the city of New York, in the fine packet-ship ""Independence,"" Captain Hardy. 1526449"|0|0|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12210|We were to sail on the fifteenth of the month (June), weather permitting; and on the fourteenth, I went on board to arrange some matters in my state-room. 1526585|1|0|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12211|I found that we were to have a great many passengers, including a more than usual number of ladies. 1526739|0|1|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12212|On the list were several of my acquaintances, and among other names, I was rejoiced to see that of Mr. Cornelius Wyatt, a young artist, for whom I entertained feelings of warm friendship. 1526838|1|1|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12213|He had been with me a fellow-student at C- University, where we were very much together. 1527025|2|1|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12214|He had the ordinary temperament of genius, and was a compound of misanthropy, sensibility, and enthusiasm. 1527113|3|1|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12215|To these qualities he united the warmest and truest heart which ever beat in a human bosom. 1527219|4|1|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12216|The box in question was, as I say, oblong. 1527310|0|10|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12217|It was about six feet in length by two and a half in breadth; I observed it attentively, and like to be precise. 1527352|1|10|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12218|Now this shape was peculiar; and no sooner had I seen it, than I took credit to myself for the accuracy of my guessing. 1527464|2|10|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12219|"I had reached the conclusion, it will be remembered, that the extra baggage of my friend, the artist, would prove to be pictures, or at least a picture; for I knew he had been for several weeks in conference with Nicolino:–and now here was a box, which, from its shape, could possibly contain nothing in the world but a copy of Leonardo's ""Last Supper;"" and a copy of this very ""Last Supper,"" done by Rubini the younger, at Florence, I had known, for some time, to be in the possession of Nicolino. 1527583"|3|10|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12220|This point, therefore, I considered as sufficiently settled. 1528081|4|10|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12221|I chuckled excessively when I thought of my acumen. 1528141|5|10|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12222|It was the first time I had ever known Wyatt to keep from me any of his artistical secrets; but here he evidently intended to steal a march upon me, and smuggle a fine picture to New York, under my very nose; expecting me to know nothing of the matter. 1528192|6|10|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12223|I resolved to quiz him well, now and hereafter. 1528444|7|10|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12224|One thing, however, annoyed me not a little. 1528491|0|11|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12225|The box did not go into the extra state-room. 1528535|1|11|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12226|It was deposited in Wyatt's own; and there, too, it remained, occupying very nearly the whole of the floor–no doubt to the exceeding discomfort of the artist and his wife;–this the more especially as the tar or paint with which it was lettered in sprawling capitals, emitted a strong, disagreeable, and, to my fancy, a peculiarly disgusting odor. 1528580|2|11|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12227|"On the lid were painted the words–""Mrs. Adelaide Curtis, Albany, New York. 1528926"|3|11|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12228|Charge of Cornelius Wyatt, Esq. 1529000|4|11|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12229|This side up. 1529031|5|11|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12230|"To be handled with care"". 1529044"|6|11|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12231|Now, I was aware that Mrs. Adelaide Curtis, of Albany, was the artist's wife's mother,–but then I looked upon the whole address as a mystification, intended especially for myself. 1529069|0|12|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12232|I made up my mind, of course, that the box and contents would never get farther north than the studio of my misanthropic friend, in Chambers Street, New York. 1529248|1|12|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12233|For the first three or four days we had fine weather, although the wind was dead ahead; having chopped round to the northward, immediately upon our losing sight of the coast. 1529406|0|13|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12234|The passengers were, consequently, in high spirits and disposed to be social. 1529580|1|13|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12235|I must except, however, Wyatt and his sisters, who behaved stiffly, and, I could not help thinking, uncourteously to the rest of the party. 1529657|2|13|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12236|Wyatt's conduct I did not so much regard. 1529796|3|13|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12237|He was gloomy, even beyond his usual habit–in fact he was morose–but in him I was prepared for eccentricity. 1529837|4|13|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12238|For the sisters, however, I could make no excuse. 1529945|5|13|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12239|They secluded themselves in their staterooms during the greater part of the passage, and absolutely refused, although I repeatedly urged them, to hold communication with any person on board. 1529994|6|13|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12240|Mrs. Wyatt herself was far more agreeable. 1530184|0|14|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12241|That is to say, she was chatty; and to be chatty is no slight recommendation at sea. 1530226|1|14|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12242|When I thought of these expressions, on the part of my friend, I confess that I felt indescribably puzzled. 1530310|10|14|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12243|Could it be possible that he was taking leave of his senses? 1530417|11|14|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12244|What else could I think? 1530477|12|14|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12245|He, so refined, so intellectual, so fastidious, with so exquisite a perception of the faulty, and so keen an appreciation of the beautiful! 1530501|13|14|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12246|"To be sure, the lady seemed especially fond of him–particularly so in his absence–when she made herself ridiculous by frequent quotations of what had been said by her ""beloved husband, Mr. Wyatt"". 1530640"|14|14|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12247|"The word ""husband"" seemed forever–to use one of her own delicate expressions–forever ""on the tip of her tongue"". 1530836"|15|14|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12248|In the meantime, it was observed by all on board, that he avoided her in the most pointed manner, and, for the most part, shut himself up alone in his state-room, where, in fact, he might have been said to live altogether, leaving his wife at full liberty to amuse herself as she thought best, in the public society of the main cabin. 1530948|16|14|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12249|She became excessively intimate with most of the ladies; and, to my profound astonishment, evinced no equivocal disposition to coquet with the men. 1531282|2|14|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12250|She amused us all very much. 1531429|3|14|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12251|"I say ""amused""–and scarcely know how to explain myself. 1531457"|4|14|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12252|The truth is, I soon found that Mrs. W. was far oftener laughed at than with. 1531512|5|14|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12253|"The gentlemen said little about her; but the ladies, in a little while, pronounced her ""a good-hearted thing, rather indifferent looking, totally uneducated, and decidedly vulgar"". 1531589"|6|14|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12254|The great wonder was, how Wyatt had been entrapped into such a match. 1531769|7|14|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12255|Wealth was the general solution–but this I knew to be no solution at all; for Wyatt had told me that she neither brought him a dollar nor had any expectations from any source whatever. 1531838|8|14|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12256|"""He had married,"" he said, ""for love, and for love only; and his bride was far more than worthy of his love"". 1532022"|9|14|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12257|My conclusion, from what I saw and heard, was, that, the artist, by some unaccountable freak of fate, or perhaps in some fit of enthusiastic and fanciful passion, had been induced to unite himself with a person altogether beneath him, and that the natural result, entire and speedy disgust, had ensued. 1532131|0|15|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12258|"I pitied him from the bottom of my heart–but could not, for that reason, quite forgive his incommunicativeness in the matter of the ""Last Supper"". 1532433"|1|15|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12259|For this I resolved to have my revenge. 1532579|2|15|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12260|One day he came upon deck, and, taking his arm as had been my wont, I sauntered with him backward and forward. 1532618|0|16|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12261|His gloom, however (which I considered quite natural under the circumstances), seemed entirely unabated. 1532728|1|16|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12262|He said little, and that moodily, and with evident effort. 1532832|2|16|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12263|I ventured a jest or two, and he made a sickening attempt at a smile. 1532890|3|16|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12264|Poor fellow! 1532959|4|16|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12265|–as I thought of his wife, I wondered that he could have heart to put on even the semblance of mirth. 1532971|5|16|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12266|I determined to commence a series of covert insinuations, or innuendoes, about the oblong box–just to let him perceive, gradually, that I was not altogether the butt, or victim, of his little bit of pleasant mystification. 1533072|6|16|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12267|My first observation was by way of opening a masked battery. 1533294|7|16|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12268|"I said something about the ""peculiar shape of that box-,"" and, as I spoke the words, I smiled knowingly, winked, and touched him gently with my forefinger in the ribs. 1533354"|8|16|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12269|The manner in which Wyatt received this harmless pleasantry convinced me, at once, that he was mad. 1533521|0|17|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12270|At first he stared at me as if he found it impossible to comprehend the witticism of my remark; but as its point seemed slowly to make its way into his brain, his eyes, in the same proportion, seemed protruding from their sockets. 1533620|1|17|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12271|Then he grew very red–then hideously pale–then, as if highly amused with what I had insinuated, he began a loud and boisterous laugh, which, to my astonishment, he kept up, with gradually increasing vigor, for ten minutes or more. 1533850|2|17|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12272|In conclusion, he fell flat and heavily upon the deck. 1534080|3|17|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12273|When I ran to uplift him, to all appearance he was dead. 1534134|4|17|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12274|I called assistance, and, with much difficulty, we brought him to himself. 1534190|0|18|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12275|Upon reviving he spoke incoherently for some time. 1534264|1|18|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12276|At length we bled him and put him to bed. 1534314|2|18|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12277|The next morning he was quite recovered, so far as regarded his mere bodily health. 1534355|3|18|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12278|Of his mind I say nothing, of course. 1534438|4|18|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12279|I avoided him during the rest of the passage, by advice of the captain, who seemed to coincide with me altogether in my views of his insanity, but cautioned me to say nothing on this head to any person on board. 1534475|5|18|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12280|Several circumstances occurred immediately after this fit of Wyatt which contributed to heighten the curiosity with which I was already possessed. 1534686|0|19|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12281|Among other things, this: I had been nervous–drank too much strong green tea, and slept ill at night–in fact, for two nights I could not be properly said to sleep at all. 1534832|1|19|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12282|Now, my state-room opened into the main cabin, or dining-room, as did those of all the single men on board. 1535002|2|19|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12283|Wyatt's three rooms were in the after-cabin, which was separated from the main one by a slight sliding door, never locked even at night. 1535109|3|19|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12284|As we were almost constantly on a wind, and the breeze was not a little stiff, the ship heeled to leeward very considerably; and whenever her starboard side was to leeward, the sliding door between the cabins slid open, and so remained, nobody taking the trouble to get up and shut it. 1535245|4|19|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12285|But my berth was in such a position, that when my own state-room door was open, as well as the sliding door in question (and my own door was always open on account of the heat,) I could see into the after-cabin quite distinctly, and just at that portion of it, too, where were situated the state-rooms of Mr. Wyatt. 1535530|5|19|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12286|Well, during two nights (not consecutive) while I lay awake, I clearly saw Mrs. W., about eleven o'clock upon each night, steal cautiously from the state-room of Mr. W., and enter the extra room, where she remained until daybreak, when she was called by her husband and went back. 1535845|6|19|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12287|That they were virtually separated was clear. 1536125|7|19|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12288|They had separate apartments–no doubt in contemplation of a more permanent divorce; and here, after all I thought was the mystery of the extra state-room. 1536170|8|19|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12289|I observed that his name was carded upon three state-rooms; and, upon again referring to the list of passengers, I found that he had engaged passage for himself, wife, and two sisters–his own. 1536324|0|2|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12290|The state-rooms were sufficiently roomy, and each had two berths, one above the other. 1536516|1|2|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12291|These berths, to be sure, were so exceedingly narrow as to be insufficient for more than one person; still, I could not comprehend why there were three state-rooms for these four persons. 1536602|2|2|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12292|I was, just at that epoch, in one of those moody frames of mind which make a man abnormally inquisitive about trifles: and I confess, with shame, that I busied myself in a variety of ill-bred and preposterous conjectures about this matter of the supernumerary state-room. 1536789|3|2|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12293|It was no business of mine, to be sure, but with none the less pertinacity did I occupy myself in attempts to resolve the enigma. 1537060|4|2|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12294|At last I reached a conclusion which wrought in me great wonder why I had not arrived at it before. 1537189|5|2|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12295|"""It is a servant of course,"" I said; ""what a fool I am, not sooner to have thought of so obvious a solution""! 1537288"|6|2|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12296|"And then I again repaired to the list–but here I saw distinctly that no servant was to come with the party, although, in fact, it had been the original design to bring one–for the words ""and servant"" had been first written and then overscored. 1537397"|7|2|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12297|"""Oh, extra baggage, to be sure,"" I now said to myself–""something he wishes not to be put in the hold–something to be kept under his own eye–ah, I have it–a painting or so–and this is what he has been bargaining about with Nicolino, the Italian Jew"". 1537640"|8|2|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12298|This idea satisfied me, and I dismissed my curiosity for the nonce. 1537889|9|2|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12299|There was another circumstance, too, which interested me much. 1537956|0|20|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12300|During the two wakeful nights in question, and immediately after the disappearance of Mrs. Wyatt into the extra state-room, I was attracted by certain singular cautious, subdued noises in that of her husband. 1538018|1|20|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12301|After listening to them for some time, with thoughtful attention, I at length succeeded perfectly in translating their import. 1538226|2|20|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12302|They were sounds occasioned by the artist in prying open the oblong box, by means of a chisel and mallet–the latter being apparently muffled, or deadened, by some soft woollen or cotton substance in which its head was enveloped. 1538352|3|20|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12303|In this manner I fancied I could distinguish the precise moment when he fairly disengaged the lid–also, that I could determine when he removed it altogether, and when he deposited it upon the lower berth in his room; this latter point I knew, for example, by certain slight taps which the lid made in striking against the wooden edges of the berth, as he endeavored to lay it down very gently–there being no room for it on the floor. 1538580|0|21|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12304|After this there was a dead stillness, and I heard nothing more, upon either occasion, until nearly daybreak; unless, perhaps, I may mention a low sobbing, or murmuring sound, so very much suppressed as to be nearly inaudible–if, indeed, the whole of this latter noise were not rather produced by my own imagination. 1539013|1|21|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12305|I say it seemed to resemble sobbing or sighing–but, of course, it could not have been either. 1539329|2|21|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12306|I rather think it was a ringing in my own ears. 1539422|3|21|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12307|Mr. Wyatt, no doubt, according to custom, was merely giving the rein to one of his hobbies–indulging in one of his fits of artistic enthusiasm. 1539469|4|21|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12308|He had opened his oblong box, in order to feast his eyes on the pictorial treasure within. 1539612|5|21|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12309|There was nothing in this, however, to make him sob. 1539702|6|21|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12310|I repeat, therefore, that it must have been simply a freak of my own fancy, distempered by good Captain Hardy's green tea. 1539754|7|21|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12311|just before dawn, on each of the two nights of which I speak, I distinctly heard Mr. Wyatt replace the lid upon the oblong box, and force the nails into their old places by means of the muffled mallet. 1539876|8|21|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12312|Having done this, he issued from his state-room, fully dressed, and proceeded to call Mrs. W. from hers. 1540077|9|21|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12313|We had been at sea seven days, and were now off Cape Hatteras, when there came a tremendously heavy blow from the southwest. 1540181|0|22|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12314|We were, in a measure, prepared for it, however, as the weather had been holding out threats for some time. 1540305|1|22|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12315|Every thing was made snug, alow and aloft; and as the wind steadily freshened, we lay to, at length, under spanker and foretopsail, both double-reefed. 1540412|2|22|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12316|In this trim we rode safely enough for forty-eight hours–the ship proving herself an excellent sea-boat in many respects, and shipping no water of any consequence. 1540563|0|23|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12317|At the end of this period, however, the gale had freshened into a hurricane, and our after–sail split into ribbons, bringing us so much in the trough of the water that we shipped several prodigious seas, one immediately after the other. 1540726|1|23|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12318|By this accident we lost three men overboard with the caboose, and nearly the whole of the larboard bulwarks. 1540962|2|23|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12319|Scarcely had we recovered our senses, before the foretopsail went into shreds, when we got up a storm stay–sail and with this did pretty well for some hours, the ship heading the sea much more steadily than before. 1541071|3|23|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12320|The gale still held on, however, and we saw no signs of its abating. 1541285|0|24|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12321|The rigging was found to be ill-fitted, and greatly strained; and on the third day of the blow, about five in the afternoon, our mizzen-mast, in a heavy lurch to windward, went by the board. 1541353|1|24|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12322|For an hour or more, we tried in vain to get rid of it, on account of the prodigious rolling of the ship; and, before we had succeeded, the carpenter came aft and announced four feet of water in the hold. 1541543|2|24|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12323|To add to our dilemma, we found the pumps choked and nearly useless. 1541747|3|24|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12324|All was now confusion and despair–but an effort was made to lighten the ship by throwing overboard as much of her cargo as could be reached, and by cutting away the two masts that remained. 1541815|0|25|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12325|This we at last accomplished–but we were still unable to do any thing at the pumps; and, in the meantime, the leak gained on us very fast. 1542004|1|25|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12326|At sundown, the gale had sensibly diminished in violence, and as the sea went down with it, we still entertained faint hopes of saving ourselves in the boats. 1542142|0|26|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12327|At eight P. M., the clouds broke away to windward, and we had the advantage of a full moon–a piece of good fortune which served wonderfully to cheer our drooping spirits. 1542300|1|26|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12328|After incredible labor we succeeded, at length, in getting the longboat over the side without material accident, and into this we crowded the whole of the crew and most of the passengers. 1542470|0|27|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12329|This party made off immediately, and, after undergoing much suffering, finally arrived, in safety, at Ocracoke Inlet, on the third day after the wreck. 1542657|1|27|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12330|Fourteen passengers, with the captain, remained on board, resolving to trust their fortunes to the jolly-boat at the stern. 1542808|0|28|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12331|We lowered it without difficulty, although it was only by a miracle that we prevented it from swamping as it touched the water. 1542931|1|28|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12332|It contained, when afloat, the captain and his wife, Mr. Wyatt and party, a Mexican officer, wife, four children, and myself, with a negro valet. 1543058|2|28|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12333|We had no room, of course, for any thing except a few positively necessary instruments, some provisions, and the clothes upon our backs. 1543203|0|29|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12334|No one had thought of even attempting to save any thing more. 1543339|1|29|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12335|What must have been the astonishment of all, then, when having proceeded a few fathoms from the ship, Mr. Wyatt stood up in the stern-sheets, and coolly demanded of Captain Hardy that the boat should be put back for the purpose of taking in his oblong box! 1543400|2|29|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12336|Wyatt's two sisters I knew very well, and most amiable and clever girls they were. 1543656|0|3|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12337|His wife he had newly married, and I had never yet seen her. 1543738|1|3|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12338|He had often talked about her in my presence, however, and in his usual style of enthusiasm. 1543798|2|3|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12339|He described her as of surpassing beauty, wit, and accomplishment. 1543890|3|3|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12340|I was, therefore, quite anxious to make her acquaintance. 1543956|4|3|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12341|"""Sit down, Mr. Wyatt,"" replied the captain, somewhat sternly, ""you will capsize us if you do not sit quite still. 1544013"|0|30|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']

12344|"vociferated Mr. Wyatt, still standing–""the box, I say! 1544177"|1|31|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12345|Captain Hardy, you cannot, you will not refuse me. 1544231|2|31|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12346|Its weight will be but a trifle–it is nothing–mere nothing. 1544281|3|31|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12347|"By the mother who bore you–for the love of Heaven–by your hope of salvation, I implore you to put back for the box""! 1544340"|4|31|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12348|"""Mr. Wyatt, you are mad. 1544456"|0|33|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12349|I cannot listen to you. 1544480|1|33|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12350|Sit down, I say, or you will swamp the boat. 1544503|2|33|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12351|Stay–hold him–seize him! 1544547|3|33|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12352|–he is about to spring overboard! 1544571|4|33|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12353|"There–I knew it–he is over""! 1544604"|5|33|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12354|As the captain said this, Mr. Wyatt, in fact, sprang from the boat, and, as we were yet in the lee of the wreck, succeeded, by almost superhuman exertion, in getting hold of a rope which hung from the fore-chains. 1544632|0|34|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12355|In another moment he was on board, and rushing frantically down into the cabin. 1544845|1|34|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12356|In the meantime, we had been swept astern of the ship, and being quite out of her lee, were at the mercy of the tremendous sea which was still running. 1544924|0|35|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12357|We made a determined effort to put back, but our little boat was like a feather in the breath of the tempest. 1545075|1|35|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12358|We saw at a glance that the doom of the unfortunate artist was sealed. 1545184|2|35|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12359|As our distance from the wreck rapidly increased, the madman (for as such only could we regard him) was seen to emerge from the companion–way, up which by dint of strength that appeared gigantic, he dragged, bodily, the oblong box. 1545254|0|36|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12360|While we gazed in the extremity of astonishment, he passed, rapidly, several turns of a three-inch rope, first around the box and then around his body. 1545485|1|36|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12361|In another instant both body and box were in the sea–disappearing suddenly, at once and forever. 1545636|2|36|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12362|We lingered awhile sadly upon our oars, with our eyes riveted upon the spot. 1545732|0|37|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12363|At length we pulled away. 1545808|1|37|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12364|The silence remained unbroken for an hour. 1545833|2|37|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12365|Finally, I hazarded a remark. 1545875|3|37|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12366|"""Did you observe, captain, how suddenly they sank? 1545904"|0|38|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12367|Was not that an exceedingly singular thing? 1545954|1|38|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12368|"I confess that I entertained some feeble hope of his final deliverance, when I saw him lash himself to the box, and commit himself to the sea"". 1545997"|2|38|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12369|"""They sank as a matter of course,"" replied the captain, ""and that like a shot. 1546140"|0|39|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12370|"They will soon rise again, however–but not till the salt melts"". 1546218"|1|39|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12371|On the day in which I visited the ship (the fourteenth), Wyatt and party were also to visit it–so the captain informed me–and I waited on board an hour longer than I had designed, in hope of being presented to the bride, but then an apology came. 1546282|0|4|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12372|"""Mrs. W. was a little indisposed, and would decline coming on board until to-morrow, at the hour of sailing"". 1546528"|1|4|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12373|"""The salt""! 1546637"|0|40|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12374|I ejaculated. 1546648|1|40|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12375|"""Hush""! 1546661"|0|41|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12376|said the captain, pointing to the wife and sisters of the deceased. 1546668|1|41|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12377|"""We must talk of these things at some more appropriate time"". 1546735"|2|41|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12378|We suffered much, and made a narrow escape, but fortune befriended us, as well as our mates in the long-boat. 1546796|0|42|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12379|We landed, in fine, more dead than alive, after four days of intense distress, upon the beach opposite Roanoke Island. 1546905|1|42|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12380|We remained here a week, were not ill-treated by the wreckers, and at length obtained a passage to New York. 1547023|2|42|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12381|"About a month after the loss of the ""Independence,"" I happened to meet Captain Hardy in Broadway. 1547131"|0|43|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12382|Our conversation turned, naturally, upon the disaster, and especially upon the sad fate of poor Wyatt. 1547228|1|43|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12383|I thus learned the following particulars. 1547330|2|43|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12384|The artist had engaged passage for himself, wife, two sisters and a servant. 1547371|0|44|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12385|His wife was, indeed, as she had been represented, a most lovely, and most accomplished woman. 1547447|1|44|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12386|On the morning of the fourteenth of June (the day in which I first visited the ship), the lady suddenly sickened and died. 1547541|2|44|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12387|The young husband was frantic with grief–but circumstances imperatively forbade the deferring his voyage to New York. 1547663|3|44|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12388|It was necessary to take to her mother the corpse of his adored wife, and, on the other hand, the universal prejudice which would prevent his doing so openly was well known. 1547780|4|44|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12389|Nine-tenths of the passengers would have abandoned the ship rather than take passage with a dead body. 1547953|5|44|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12390|In this dilemma, Captain Hardy arranged that the corpse, being first partially embalmed, and packed, with a large quantity of salt, in a box of suitable dimensions, should be conveyed on board as merchandise. 1548055|0|45|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12391|Nothing was to be said of the lady's decease; and, as it was well understood that Mr. Wyatt had engaged passage for his wife, it became necessary that some person should personate her during the voyage. 1548263|1|45|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12392|This the deceased lady's-maid was easily prevailed on to do. 1548465|2|45|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12393|The extra state-room, originally engaged for this girl during her mistress' life, was now merely retained. 1548525|3|45|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12394|In this state-room the pseudo-wife, slept, of course, every night. 1548631|4|45|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12395|In the daytime she performed, to the best of her ability, the part of her mistress–whose person, it had been carefully ascertained, was unknown to any of the passengers on board. 1548697|5|45|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12396|My own mistake arose, naturally enough, through too careless, too inquisitive, and too impulsive a temperament. 1548875|0|46|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12397|But of late, it is a rare thing that I sleep soundly at night. 1548986|1|46|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12398|There is a countenance which haunts me, turn as I will. 1549048|2|46|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12399|There is an hysterical laugh which will forever ring within my ears. 1549103|3|46|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12400|"The morrow having arrived, I was going from my hotel to the wharf, when Captain Hardy met me and said that, ""owing to circumstances"" (a stupid but convenient phrase), ""he rather thought the 'Independence' would not sail for a day or two, and that when all was ready, he would send up and let me know"". 1549171"|0|5|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12401|"This I thought strange, for there was a stiff southerly breeze; but as ""the circumstances"" were not forthcoming, although I pumped for them with much perseverance, I had nothing to do but to return home and digest my impatience at leisure. 1549472"|1|5|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12402|I did not receive the expected message from the captain for nearly a week. 1549711|0|6|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12403|It came at length, however, and I immediately went on board. 1549785|1|6|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12404|The ship was crowded with passengers, and every thing was in the bustle attendant upon making sail. 1549845|2|6|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12405|Wyatt's party arrived in about ten minutes after myself. 1549944|3|6|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12406|There were the two sisters, the bride, and the artist- the latter in one of his customary fits of moody misanthropy. 1550000|4|6|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12407|I was too well used to these, however, to pay them any special attention. 1550116|5|6|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12408|He did not even introduce me to his wife–this courtesy devolving, per force, upon his sister Marian–a very sweet and intelligent girl, who, in a few hurried words, made us acquainted. 1550189|6|6|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12409|Mrs. Wyatt had been closely veiled; and when she raised her veil, in acknowledging my bow, I confess that I was very profoundly astonished. 1550372|0|7|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12410|I should have been much more so, however, had not long experience advised me not to trust, with too implicit a reliance, the enthusiastic descriptions of my friend, the artist, when indulging in comments upon the loveliness of woman. 1550511|1|7|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12411|When beauty was the theme, I well knew with what facility he soared into the regions of the purely ideal. 1550744|2|7|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12412|The truth is, I could not help regarding Mrs. Wyatt as a decidedly plain-looking woman. 1550849|0|8|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12413|If not positively ugly, she was not, I think, very far from it. 1550936|1|8|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12414|She was dressed, however, in exquisite taste–and then I had no doubt that she had captivated my friend's heart by the more enduring graces of the intellect and soul. 1550999|2|8|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12415|My old inquisitiveness now returned. 1551164|0|9|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12416|There was no servant–that was a settled point. 1551200|1|9|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12417|I looked, therefore, for the extra baggage. 1551246|2|9|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12418|After some delay, a cart arrived at the wharf, with an oblong pine box, which was every thing that seemed to be expected. 1551289|3|9|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12419|Immediately upon its arrival we made sail, and in a short time were safely over the bar and standing out to sea. 1551410|4|9|The Oblong Box|1844-09-25 00:00:00|['Horror', 'Ratiocination']
12420|It was a chilly November afternoon. 1551522|0|1|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12421|I had just consummated an unusually hearty dinner, of which the dyspeptic truffe formed not the least important item, and was sitting alone in the dining-room, with my feet upon the fender, and at my elbow a small table which I had rolled up to the fire, and upon which were some apologies for dessert, with some miscellaneous bottles of wine, spirit, and liqueur. 1551557|1|1|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12422|"In the morning I had been reading Glover's ""Leonidas,"" Wilkies ""Epigoniad,"" Lamartine's ""Pilgrimage,"" Barlow's ""Columbiad,"" Tuckermann's ""Sicily,"" and Griswold's ""Curiosities""; I am willing to confess, therefore, that I now felt a little stupid. 1551921"|2|1|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12423|I made effort to arouse myself by aid of frequent Lafitte, and, all failing, I betook myself to a stray newspaper in despair. 1552166|3|1|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12424|"Having carefully perused the column of ""houses to let,"" and the column of ""dogs lost,"" and then the two columns of ""wives and apprentices runaway,"" I attacked with great resolution the editorial matter, and, reading it from beginning to end without understanding a syllable, conceived the possibility of its being Chinese, and so re-read it from the end to the beginning, but with no more satisfactory result. 1552291"|4|1|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

12471|I cannot pretend to recount all that he told me, but I gleaned from what he said that he was the genius who presided over the contre temps of mankind, and whose business it was to bring about the odd accidents which are continually astonishing the skeptic. 1555935|1|27|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12472|Once or twice, upon my venturing to express my total incredulity in respect to his pretensions, he grew very angry indeed, so that at length I considered it the wiser policy to say nothing at all, and let him have his own way. 1556191|2|27|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12473|He talked on, therefore, at great length, while I merely leaned back in my chair with my eyes shut, and amused myself with munching raisins and flipping the stems about the room. 1556417|3|27|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

12477|The very few glasses of Lafitte that I had sipped had the effect of rendering me drowsy, and I felt inclined to take a nap of some fifteen or twenty minutes, as is my custom after dinner. 1557026|1|28|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12478|At six I had an appointment of consequence, which it was quite indispensable that I should keep. 1557213|2|28|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12479|The policy of insurance for my dwelling house had expired the day before; and, some dispute having arisen, it was agreed that, at six, I should meet the board of directors of the company and settle the terms of a renewal. 1557309|3|28|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12480|Glancing upward at the clock on the mantel-piece (for I felt too drowsy to take out my watch), I had the pleasure to find that I had still twenty-five minutes to spare. 1557530|4|28|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12481|It was half past five; I could easily walk to the insurance office in five minutes; and my usual post prandian siestas had never been known to exceed five and twenty. 1557698|5|28|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

12483|Having completed them to my satisfaction, I again looked toward the time-piece, and was half inclined to believe in the possibility of odd accidents when I found that, instead of my ordinary fifteen or twenty minutes, I had been dozing only three; for it still wanted seven and twenty of the appointed hour. 1557946|0|29|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12484|I betook myself again to my nap, and at length a second time awoke, when, to my utter amazement, it still wanted twenty-seven minutes of six. 1558253|1|29|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12485|I jumped up to examine the clock, and found that it had ceased running. 1558394|2|29|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12486|"My watch informed me that it was half past seven; and, of course, having slept two hours, I was too late for my appointment ""It will make no difference,"" I said; ""I can call at the office in the morning and apologize; in the meantime what can be the matter with the clock""? 1558465"|3|29|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12487|Upon examining it I discovered that one of the raisin-stems which I had been flipping about the room during the discourse of the Angel of the Odd had flown through the fractured crystal, and lodging, singularly enough, in the key-hole, with an end projecting outward, had thus arrested the revolution of the minute-hand. 1558738|4|29|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

12495|Methought he stood at the foot of the couch, drew aside the curtains, and, in the hollow, detestable tones of a rum-puncheon, menaced me with the bitterest vengeance for the contempt with which I had treated him. 1559568|1|32|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12496|He concluded a long harrangue by taking off his funnelcap, inserting the tube into my gullet, and thus deluging me with an ocean of Kirschenwasser, which he poured, in a continuous flood, from one of the long-necked bottles that stood him instead of an arm. 1559780|2|32|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12497|My agony was at length insufferable, and I awoke just in time to perceive that a rat had ran off with the lighted candle from the stand, but not in season to prevent his making his escape with it through the hole. 1560037|3|32|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12498|Very soon, a strong suffocating odor assailed my nostrils; the house, I clearly perceived, was on fire. 1560250|4|32|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12499|In a few minutes the blaze broke forth with violence, and in an incredibly brief period the entire building was wrapped in flames. 1560353|5|32|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

12502|By means of this I was descending rapidly, and in apparent safety, when a huge hog, about whose rotund stomach, and indeed about whose whole air and physiognomy, there was something which reminded me of the Angel of the Odd,;when this hog, I say, which hitherto had been quietly slumbering in the mud, took it suddenly into his head that his left shoulder needed scratching, and could find no more convenient rubbing post than that afforded by the foot of the ladder. 1560610|8|32|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12503|In an instant I was precipitated, and had the misfortune to fracture my arm. 1561077|9|32|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12504|This accident, with the loss of my insurance, and with the more serious loss of my hair, the whole of which had been singed off by the fire, predisposed me to serious impressions, so that, finally, I made up my mind to take a wife. 1561153|0|33|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12505|There was a rich widow disconsolate for the loss of her seventh husband, and to her wounded spirit I offered the balm of my vows. 1561384|1|33|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

12514|Meeting my betrothed in an avenue thronged with the elite of the city, I was hastening to greet her with one of my best considered bows, when a small particle of some foreign matter lodging in the corner of my eye, rendered me, for the moment, completely blind. 1562195|2|34|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12515|Before I could recover my sight, the lady of my love had disappeared;irreparably affronted at what she chose to consider my premeditated rudeness in passing her by ungreeted. 1562456|3|34|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12516|While I stood bewildered at the suddenness of this accident (which might have happened, nevertheless, to any one under the sun), and while I still continued incapable of sight, I was accosted by the Angel of the Odd, who proffered me his aid with a civility which I had no reason to expect. 1562630|4|34|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

12521|Postponing, therefore, for the present, my suicidal design, I just slipped my nether extremities into the sleeves of my coat, and betook myself to a pursuit of the felon with all the nimbleness which the case required and its circumstances would admit. 1563646|3|35|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12522|But my evil destiny attended me still. 1563898|4|35|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12523|As I ran at full speed, with my nose up in the atmosphere, and intent only upon the purloiner of my property, I suddenly perceived that my feet rested no longer upon terre firma; the fact is, I had thrown myself over a precipice, and should inevitably have been dashed to pieces, but for my good fortune in grasping the end of a long guide-rope, which descended from a passing balloon. 1563936|5|35|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

12544|With these words he let fall a heavy bottle of Kirschenwasser which, dropping precisely upon the crown of my head, caused me to imagine that my brains were entirely knocked out. 1566153|0|41|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12545|Impressed with this idea, I was about to relinquish my hold and give up the ghost with a good grace, when I was arrested by the cry of the Angel, who bade me hold on. 1566330|1|41|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

12549|I made haste, hereupon, to nod my head twice;once in the negative, meaning thereby that I would prefer not taking the other bottle at present;and once in the affirmative, intending thus to imply that I was sober and had positively come to my senses. 1566628|0|43|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12550|By these means I somewhat softened the Angel. 1566877|1|43|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

12558|Upon seeing this I fell into a great rage, without exactly knowing why. 1567189|0|5|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12559|"""This thing,"" I exclaimed, ""is a contemptible falsehood;a poor hoax;the lees of the invention of some pitiable penny-a-liner;of some wretched concoctor of accidents in Cocaigne. 1567260"|1|5|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

12561|For my own part, I intend to believe nothing henceforward that has anything of the 'singular' about it. 1567919|3|5|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

12564|In the first place, my left arm had been broken in my fall from the ladder, and, therefore, had I let go my hold with the right hand, I must have let go altogether. 1568215|1|51|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12565|In the second place, I could have no breeches until I came across the crow. 1568379|2|51|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12566|I was therefore obliged, much to my regret, to shake my head in the negative;intending thus to give the Angel to understand that I found it inconvenient, just at that moment, to comply with his very reasonable demand! 1568454|3|51|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

12571|Upon coming to my senses, (for the fall had very thoroughly stunned me,) I found it about four o'clock in the morning. 1569043|0|54|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12572|I lay outstretched where I had fAllan from the balloon. 1569161|1|54|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12573|My head grovelled in the ashes of an extinguished fire, while my feet reposed upon the wreck of a small table, overthrown, and amid the fragments of a miscellaneous dessert, intermingled with a newspaper, some broken glass and shattered bottles, and an empty jug of the Schiedam Kirschenwasser. 1569216|2|54|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12574|Thus revenged himself the Angel of the Odd. 1569510|3|54|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

12577|At first I took it for a rumbling in my ears;such as man sometimes experiences when getting very drunk- but, upon second thought, I considered the sound as more nearly resembling that which proceeds from an empty barrel beaten with a big stick; and, in fact, this I should have concluded it to be, but for the articulation of the syllables and words. 1569654|2|6|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12578|I am by no means naturally nervous, and the very few glasses of Lafitte which I had sipped served to embolden me a little, so that I felt nothing of trepidation, but merely uplifted my eyes with a leisurely movement, and looked carefully around the room for the intruder. 1570004|3|6|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12579|I could not, however, perceive any one at all. 1570275|4|6|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

12582|Hereupon I bethought me of looking immediately before my nose, and there, sure enough, confronting me at the table sat a personage nondescript, although not altogether indescribable. 1570454|0|8|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12583|His body was a wine-pipe, or a rum-puncheon, or something of that character, and had a truly Falstaffian air. 1570636|1|8|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12584|In its nether extremity were inserted two kegs, which seemed to answer all the purposes of legs. 1570745|2|8|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12585|For arms there dangled from the upper portion of the carcass two tolerably long bottles, with the necks outward for hands. 1570841|3|8|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12586|All the head that I saw the monster possessed of was one of those Hessian canteens which resemble a large snuff-box with a hole in the middle of the lid. 1570963|4|8|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12587|This canteen (with a funnel on its top, like a cavalier cap slouched over the eyes) was set on edge upon the puncheon, with the hole toward myself; and through this hole, which seemed puckered up like the mouth of a very precise old maid, the creature was emitting certain rumbling and grumbling noises which he evidently intended for intelligible talk. 1571116|5|8|The Angel Of The Odd|1844-10-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

12591|I will expound to you–as I alone can–the secret of the enginery that effected the Rattleborough miracle–the one, the true, the admitted, the undisputed, the indisputable miracle, which put a definite end to infidelity among the Rattleburghers and converted to the orthodoxy of the grandames all the carnal-minded who had ventured to be sceptical before. 1571747|1|0|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12592|This event–which I should be sorry to discuss in a tone of unsuitable levity–occurred in the summer of 18-. 1572100|0|1|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12593|Mr. Barnabas Shuttleworthy–one of the wealthiest and most respectable citizens of the borough–had been missing for several days under circumstances which gave rise to suspicion of foul play. 1572207|1|1|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12594|Mr. Shuttleworthy had set out from Rattleborough very early one Saturday morning, on horseback, with the avowed intention of proceeding to the city of-, about fifteen miles distant, and of returning the night of the same day. 1572397|2|1|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12595|Two hours after his departure, however, his horse returned without him, and without the saddle-bags which had been strapped on his back at starting. 1572622|3|1|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12596|The animal was wounded, too, and covered with mud. 1572770|4|1|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12597|These circumstances naturally gave rise to much alarm among the friends of the missing man; and when it was found, on Sunday morning, that he had not yet made his appearance, the whole borough arose en masse to go and look for his body. 1572820|5|1|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12598|Matters now wore a very serious aspect for Mr. Pennifeather, and it was observed, as an indubitable confirmation of the suspicions which were excited against him, that he grew exceedingly pale, and when asked what he had to say for himself, was utterly incapable of saying a word. 1573056|0|10|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12599|Hereupon, the few friends his riotous mode of living had left him, deserted him at once to a man, and were even more clamorous than his ancient and avowed enemies for his instantaneous arrest. 1573336|1|10|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12600|But, on the other hand, the magnanimity of Mr. Goodfellow shone forth with only the more brilliant lustre through contrast. 1573528|2|10|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12601|"He made a warm and intensely eloquent defence of Mr. Pennifeather, in which he alluded more than once to his own sincere forgiveness of that wild young gentleman–""the heir of the worthy Mr. Shuttleworthy,""–for the insult which he (the young gentleman) had, no doubt in the heat of passion, thought proper to put upon him (Mr. Goodfellow). 1573651"|3|10|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12602|"""He forgave him for it,"" he said, ""from the very bottom of his heart; and for himself (Mr. Goodfellow), so far from pushing the suspicious circumstances to extremity, which he was sorry to say, really had arisen against Mr. Pennifeather, he (Mr. Goodfellow) would make every exertion in his power, would employ all the little eloquence in his possession to–to–to–soften down, as much as he could conscientiously do so, the worst features of this really exceedingly perplexing piece of business"". 1573989"|4|10|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12603|Mr. Goodfellow went on for some half hour longer in this strain, very much to the credit both of his head and of his heart; but your warm-hearted people are seldom apposite in their observations–they run into all sorts of blunders, contre-temps and mal apropos-isms, in the hot-headedness of their zeal to serve a friend–thus, often with the kindest intentions in the world, doing infinitely more to prejudice his cause than to advance it. 1574484|0|11|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12604|"So, in the present instance, it turned out with all the eloquence of ""Old Charley""; for, although he laboured earnestly in behalf of the suspected, yet it so happened, somehow or other, that every syllable he uttered of which the direct but unwitting tendency was not to exalt the speaker in the good opinion of his audience, had the effect to deepen the suspicion already attached to the individual whose cause he pleaded, and to arouse against him the fury of the mob. 1574923"|0|12|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12605|"One of the most unaccountable errors committed by the orator was his allusion to the suspected as ""the heir of the worthy old gentleman Mr. Shuttleworthy"". 1575393"|0|13|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12606|The people had really never thought of this before. 1575548|1|13|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12607|Cui, to whom; bono, is it for a benefit. 1575599|10|13|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12608|It is a purely legal phrase, and applicable precisely in cases such as we have now under consideration, where the probability of the doer of a deed hinges upon the probability of the benefit accruing to this individual or to that from the deed's accomplishment. 1575639|11|13|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12609|Now in the present instance, the question cui bono? 1575900|12|13|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12610|very pointedly implicated Mr. Pennifeather. 1575951|13|13|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12611|His uncle had threatened him, after making a will in his favour, with disinheritance. 1575994|14|13|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12612|But the threat had not been actually kept; the original will, it appeared, had not been altered. 1576079|15|13|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12613|Had it been altered, the only supposable motive for murder on the part of the suspected would have been the ordinary one of revenge; and even this would have been counteracted by the hope of reinstation into the good graces of the uncle. 1576175|16|13|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12614|But the will being unaltered, while the threat to alter remained suspended over the nephew's head, there appears at once the very strongest possible inducement for the atrocity, and so concluded, very sagaciously, the worthy citizens of the borough of Rattle. 1576412|17|13|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12615|"They had only remembered certain threats of disinheritance uttered a year or two previously by the uncle (who had no living relative except the nephew), and they had, therefore, always looked upon this disinheritance as a matter that was settled–so single-minded a race of beings were the Rattleburghers; but the remark of ""Old Charley"" brought them at once to a consideration of this point, and thus gave them to see the possibility of the threats having been nothing more than a threat. 1576671"|2|13|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12616|And straightway hereupon, arose the natural question of cui bono? 1577159|3|13|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12617|–a question that tended even more than the waistcoat to fasten the terrible crime upon the young man. 1577224|4|13|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12618|And here, lest I may be misunderstood, permit me to digress for one moment merely to observe that the exceedingly brief and simple Latin phrase which I have employed, is invariably mistranslated and misconceived. 1577325|5|13|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']

12623|Mr. Pennifeather was, accordingly, arrested upon the spot, and the crowd, after some further search, proceeded homeward, having him in custody. 1578093|0|14|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12624|On the route, however, another circumstance occurred tending to confirm the suspicion entertained. 1578236|1|14|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12625|Mr. Goodfellow, whose zeal led him to be always a little in advance of the party, was seen suddenly to run forward a few paces, stoop, and then apparently to pick up some small object from the grass. 1578334|2|14|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12626|Having quickly examined it he was observed, too, to make a sort of half attempt at concealing it in his coat pocket; but this action was noticed, as I say, and consequently prevented, when the object picked up was found to be a Spanish knife which a dozen persons at once recognized as belonging to Mr. Pennifeather. 1578533|3|14|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12627|Moreover, his initials were engraved upon the handle. 1578849|4|14|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12628|The blade of this knife was open and bloody. 1578902|5|14|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12629|No doubt now remained of the guilt of the nephew, and immediately upon reaching Rattleborough he was taken before a magistrate for examination. 1578946|0|15|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12630|Here matters again took a most unfavourable turn. 1579089|0|16|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12631|The prisoner, being questioned as to his whereabouts on the morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy's disappearance, had absolutely the audacity to acknowledge that on that very morning he had been out with his rifle deer-stalking, in the immediate neighbourhood of the pool where the blood-stained waistcoat had been discovered through the sagacity of Mr. Goodfellow. 1579138|1|16|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12632|This latter now came forward, and, with tears in his eyes, asked permission to be examined. 1579495|0|17|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12633|He said that a stern sense of the duty he owed his Maker, not less than his fellow-men, would permit him no longer to remain silent. 1579586|1|17|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12634|Hitherto, the sincerest affection for the young man (notwithstanding the latter's ill-treatment of himself, Mr. Goodfellow) had induced him to make every hypothesis which imagination could suggest, by way of endeavouring to account for what appeared suspicious in the circumstances that told so seriously against Mr. Pennifeather, but these circumstances were now altogether too convincing–too damning, he would hesitate no longer- he would tell all he knew, although his heart (Mr. Goodfellow's) should absolutely burst asunder in the effort. 1579718|2|17|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12635|"He then went on to state that, on the afternoon of the day previous to Mr. Shuttleworthy's departure for the city, that worthy old gentleman had mentioned to his nephew, in his hearing (Mr. Goodfellow's), that his object in going to town on the morrow was to make a deposit of an unusually large sum of money in the ""Farmers and Mechanics' Bank,"" and that, then and there, the said Mr. Shuttleworthy had distinctly avowed to the said nephew his irrevocable determination of rescinding the will originally made, and of cutting him off with a shilling. 1580261"|3|17|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12636|He (the witness) now solemnly called upon the accused to state whether what he (the witness) had just stated was or was not the truth in every substantial particular. 1580811|4|17|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12637|Much to the astonishment of every one present, Mr. Pennifeather frankly admitted that it was. 1580977|5|17|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12638|The magistrate now considered it his duty to send a couple of constables to search the chamber of the accused in the house of his uncle. 1581070|0|18|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12639|From this search they almost immediately returned with the well-known steel-bound, russet leather pocket-book which the old gentleman had been in the habit of carrying for years. 1581206|1|18|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12640|Its valuable contents, however, had been abstracted, and the magistrate in vain endeavoured to extort from the prisoner the use which had been made of them, or the place of their concealment. 1581384|2|18|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12641|Indeed, he obstinately denied all knowledge of the matter. 1581575|3|18|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12642|The constables, also, discovered, between the bed and sacking of the unhappy man, a shirt and neck-handkerchief both marked with the initials of his name, and both hideously besmeared with the blood of the victim. 1581633|4|18|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12643|At this juncture, it was announced that the horse of the murdered man had just expired in the stable from the effects of the wound he had received, and it was proposed by Mr. Goodfellow that a post mortem examination of the beast should be immediately made, with the view, if possible, of discovering the ball. 1581846|0|19|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12644|This was accordingly done; and, as if to demonstrate beyond a question the guilt of the accused, Mr. Goodfellow, after considerable searching in the cavity of the chest was enabled to detect and to pull forth a bullet of very extraordinary size, which, upon trial, was found to be exactly adapted to the bore of Mr. Pennifeather's rifle, while it was far too large for that of any other person in the borough or its vicinity. 1582156|1|19|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12645|To render the matter even surer yet, however, this bullet was discovered to have a flaw or seam at right angles to the usual suture, and upon examination, this seam corresponded precisely with an accidental ridge or elevation in a pair of moulds acknowledged by the accused himself to be his own property. 1582581|2|19|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12646|Upon finding of this bullet, the examining magistrate refused to listen to any farther testimony, and immediately committed the prisoner for trial-declining resolutely to take any bail in the case, although against this severity Mr. Goodfellow very warmly remonstrated, and offered to become surety in whatever amount might be required. 1582886|3|19|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12647|"This generosity on the part of ""Old Charley"" was only in accordance with the whole tenour of his amiable and chivalrous conduct during the entire period of his sojourn in the borough of Rattle. 1583222"|4|19|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12648|In the present instance the worthy man was so entirely carried away by the excessive warmth of his sympathy, that he seemed to have quite forgotten, when he offered to go bail for his young friend, that he himself (Mr. Goodfellow) did not possess a single dollar's worth of property upon the face of the earth. 1583415|5|19|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12649|"The foremost and most energetic in instituting this search was the bosom friend of Mr. Shuttleworthy–a Mr. Charles Goodfellow, or, as he was universally called, ""Charley Goodfellow,"" or ""Old Charley Goodfellow"". 1583725"|0|2|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12650|"Now, whether it is a marvellous coincidence, or whether it is that the name itself has an imperceptible effect upon the character, I have never yet been able to ascertain; but the fact is unquestionable, that there never yet was any person named Charles who was not an open, manly, honest, good-natured, and frank-hearted fellow, with a rich, clear voice, that did you good to hear it, and an eye that looked you always straight in the face, as much as to say: ""I have a clear conscience myself, am afraid of no man, and am altogether above doing a mean action"". 1583936"|1|2|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12651|"And thus all the hearty, careless, ""walking gentlemen"" of the stage are very certain to be called Charles. 1584498"|2|2|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']

12653|"Mr. Pennifeather, amid the loud execrations of all Rattleborough, was brought to trial at the next criminal sessions, when the chain of circumstantial evidence (strengthened as it was by some additional damning facts, which Mr. Goodfellow's sensitive conscientiousness forbade him to withhold from the court) was considered so unbroken and so thoroughly conclusive, that the jury, without leaving their seats, returned an immediate verdict of ""Guilty of murder in the first degree"". 1584656"|1|20|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12654|Soon afterward the unhappy wretch received sentence of death, and was remanded to the county jail to await the inexorable vengeance of the law. 1585138|2|20|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']

12656|He became ten times a greater favorite than ever, and, as a natural result of the hospitality with which he was treated, he relaxed, as it were, perforce, the extremely parsimonious habits which his poverty had hitherto impelled him to observe, and very frequently had little reunions at his own house, when wit and jollity reigned supreme-dampened a little, of course, by the occasional remembrance of the untoward and melancholy fate which impended over the nephew of the late lamented bosom friend of the generous host. 1585408|1|21|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']

12675|The fact is, that Mr. Goodfellow had, since the death of Mr. Shuttleworthy, given over all expectation of ever receiving the promised Chateau-Margaux; and he, therefore, looked upon it now as a sort of especial dispensation of Providence in his behalf. 1587178|0|35|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12676|He was highly delighted, of course, and in the exuberance of his joy invited a large party of friends to a petit souper on the morrow, for the purpose of broaching the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy's present. 1587430|1|35|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']

12679|He did not mention to any one–if I remember aright–that he had received a present of Chateau-Margaux. 1587797|4|35|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12680|He merely asked his friends to come and help him drink some, of a remarkable fine quality and rich flavour, that he had ordered up from the city a couple of months ago, and of which he would be in the receipt upon the morrow. 1587898|5|35|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12681|"I have often puzzled myself to imagine why it was that ""Old Charley"" came to the conclusion to say nothing about having received the wine from his old friend, but I could never precisely understand his reason for the silence, although he had some excellent and very magnanimous reason, no doubt. 1588123"|6|35|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12682|The morrow at length arrived, and with it a very large and highly respectable company at Mr. Goodfellow's house. 1588418|0|36|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12683|"Indeed, half the borough was there,–I myself among the number,–but, much to the vexation of the host, the Chateau-Margaux did not arrive until a late hour, and when the sumptuous supper supplied by ""Old Charley"" had been done very ample justice by the guests. 1588530"|1|36|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']

12688|I lent a helping hand; and, in a trice we had the box upon the table, in the midst of all the bottles and glasses, not a few of which were demolished in the scuffle. 1589047|1|37|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12689|"""Old Charley,"" who was pretty much intoxicated, and excessively red in the face, now took a seat, with an air of mock dignity, at the head of the board, and thumped furiously upon it with a decanter, calling upon the company to keep order ""during the ceremony of disinterring the treasure"". 1589212"|2|37|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12690|After some vociferation, quiet was at length fully restored, and, as very often happens in similar cases, a profound and remarkable silence ensued. 1589502|0|38|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12691|"Being then requested to force open the lid, I complied, of course, ""with an infinite deal of pleasure"". 1589649"|1|38|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12692|I inserted a chisel, and giving it a few slight taps with a hammer, the top of the box flew suddenly off, and at the same instant, there sprang up into a sitting position, directly facing the host, the bruised, bloody, and nearly putrid corpse of the murdered Mr. Shuttleworthy himself. 1589752|2|38|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12693|"It gazed for a few seconds, fixedly and sorrowfully, with its decaying and lack-lustre eyes, full into the countenance of Mr. Goodfellow; uttered slowly, but clearly and impressively, the words–""Thou art the man""! 1590038"|3|38|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12694|and then, falling over the side of the chest as if thoroughly satisfied, stretched out its limbs quiveringly upon the table. 1590251|4|38|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12695|The scene that ensued is altogether beyond description. 1590375|0|39|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12696|The rush for the doors and windows was terrific, and many of the most robust men in the room fainted outright through sheer horror. 1590430|1|39|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12697|But after the first wild, shrieking burst of affright, all eyes were directed to Mr. Goodfellow. 1590561|2|39|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12698|If I live a thousand years, I can never forget the more than mortal agony which was depicted in that ghastly face of his, so lately rubicund with triumph and wine. 1590657|3|39|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12699|For several minutes he sat rigidly as a statue of marble; his eyes seeming, in the intense vacancy of their gaze, to be turned inward and absorbed in the contemplation of his own miserable, murderous soul. 1590820|4|39|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12700|At length their expression appeared to flash suddenly out into the external world, when, with a quick leap, he sprang from his chair, and falling heavily with his head and shoulders upon the table, and in contact with the corpse, poured out rapidly and vehemently a detailed confession of the hideous crime for which Mr. Pennifeather was then imprisoned and doomed to die. 1591025|5|39|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12701|"I have already said that Mr. Shuttleworthy was one of the most respectable and, undoubtedly, he was the most wealthy man in Rattleborough, while ""Old Charley Goodfellow"" was upon as intimate terms with him as if he had been his own brother. 1591397"|0|4|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12702|"The two old gentlemen were next-door neighbours, and, although Mr. Shuttleworthy seldom, if ever, visited ""Old Charley,"" and never was known to take a meal in his house, still this did not prevent the two friends from being exceedingly intimate, as I have just observed; for ""Old Charley"" never let a day pass without stepping in three or four times to see how his neighbour came on, and very often he would stay to breakfast or tea, and almost always to dinner, and then the amount of wine that was made way with by the two cronies at a sitting, it would really be a difficult thing to ascertain. 1591637"|1|4|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12703|"""Old Charleys"" favorite beverage was Chateau-Margaux, and it appeared to do Mr. Shuttleworthy's heart good to see the old fellow swallow it, as he did, quart after quart; so that, one day, when the wine was in and the wit as a natural consequence, somewhat out, he said to his crony, as he slapped him upon the back–""I tell you what it is, 'Old Charley,' you are, by all odds, the heartiest old fellow I ever came across in all my born days; and, since you love to guzzle the wine at that fashion, I'll be darned if I don't have to make thee a present of a big box of the Chateau-Margaux. 1592234"|2|4|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']

12706|I mention this little bit of liberality on the part of Mr. Shuttleworthy, just by way of showing you how very intimate an understanding existed between the two friends. 1593315|5|4|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12707|What he recounted was in substance this:–He followed his victim to the vicinity of the pool; there shot his horse with a pistol; despatched its rider with the butt end; possessed himself of the pocket-book, and, supposing the horse dead, dragged it with great labour to the brambles by the pond. 1593483|0|40|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12708|Upon his own beast he slung the corpse of Mr. Shuttleworthy, and thus bore it to a secure place of concealment a long distance off through the woods. 1593778|1|40|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12709|The waistcoat, the knife, the pocket-book, and bullet, had been placed by himself where found, with the view of avenging himself upon Mr. Pennifeather. 1593927|0|41|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12710|He had also contrived the discovery of the stained handkerchief and shirt. 1594078|1|41|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12711|Towards the end of the blood-churning recital the words of the guilty wretch faltered and grew hollow. 1594152|0|42|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12712|When the record was finally exhausted, he arose, staggered backward from the table, and fell-dead. 1594254|1|42|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12713|The means by which this happily-timed confession was extorted, although efficient, were simple indeed. 1594352|0|43|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12714|Mr. Goodfellow's excess of frankness had disgusted me, and excited my suspicions from the first. 1594454|1|43|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12715|I was present when Mr. Pennifeather had struck him, and the fiendish expression which then arose upon his countenance, although momentary, assured me that his threat of vengeance would, if possible, be rigidly fulfilled. 1594550|2|43|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12716|"I was thus prepared to view the manoeuvering of ""Old Charley"" in a very different light from that in which it was regarded by the good citizens of Rattleborough. 1594770"|3|43|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12717|I saw at once that all the criminating discoveries arose, either directly or indirectly, from himself. 1594931|4|43|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12718|But the fact which clearly opened my eyes to the true state of the case, was the affair of the bullet, found by Mr. G. in the carcass of the horse. 1595033|5|43|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12719|I had not forgotten, although the Rattleburghers had, that there was a hole where the ball had entered the horse, and another where it went out. 1595180|6|43|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12720|If it were found in the animal then, after having made its exit, I saw clearly that it must have been deposited by the person who found it. 1595324|7|43|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12721|The bloody shirt and handkerchief confirmed the idea suggested by the bullet; for the blood on examination proved to be capital claret, and no more. 1595463|8|43|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12722|When I came to think of these things, and also of the late increase of liberality and expenditure on the part of Mr. Goodfellow, I entertained a suspicion which was none the less strong because I kept it altogether to myself. 1595611|9|43|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12723|In the meantime, I instituted a rigorous private search for the corpse of Mr. Shuttleworthy, and, for good reasons, searched in quarters as divergent as possible from those to which Mr. Goodfellow conducted his party. 1595836|0|44|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12724|The result was that, after some days, I came across an old dry well, the mouth of which was nearly hidden by brambles; and here, at the bottom, I discovered what I sought. 1596053|1|44|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12725|Now it so happened that I had overheard the colloquy between the two cronies, when Mr. Goodfellow had contrived to cajole his host into the promise of a box of Chateaux-Margaux. 1596224|0|45|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12726|Upon this hint I acted. 1596401|1|45|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12727|I procured a stiff piece of whalebone, thrust it down the throat of the corpse, and deposited the latter in an old wine box-taking care so to double the body up as to double the whalebone with it. 1596424|2|45|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12728|In this manner I had to press forcibly upon the lid to keep it down while I secured it with nails; and I anticipated, of course, that as soon as these latter were removed, the top would fly off and the body up. 1596620|3|45|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12729|Having thus arranged the box, I marked, numbered, and addressed it as already told; and then writing a letter in the name of the wine merchants with whom Mr. Shuttleworthy dealt, I gave instructions to my servant to wheel the box to Mr. Goodfellow's door, in a barrow, at a given signal from myself. 1596830|0|46|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12730|For the words which I intended the corpse to speak, I confidently depended upon my ventriloquial abilities; for their effect, I counted upon the conscience of the murderous wretch. 1597129|1|46|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12731|I believe there is nothing more to be explained. 1597309|0|47|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12732|Mr. Pennifeather was released upon the spot, inherited the fortune of his uncle, profited by the lessons of experience, turned over a new leaf, and led happily ever afterward a new life. 1597357|1|47|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12733|"Well, on the Sunday morning in question, when it came to be fairly understood that Mr. Shuttleworthy had met with foul play, I never saw any one so profoundly affected as ""Old Charley Goodfellow"". 1597543"|0|5|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12734|When he first heard that the horse had come home without his master, and without his master's saddle-bags, and all bloody from a pistol-shot, that had gone clean through and through the poor animal's chest without quite killing him; when he heard all this, he turned as pale as if the missing man had been his own dear brother or father, and shivered and shook all over as if he had had a fit of the ague. 1597739|1|5|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12735|At first he was too much overpowered with grief to be able to do any thing at all, or to concert upon any plan of action; so that for a long time he endeavoured to dissuade Mr. Shuttleworthy's other friends from making a stir about the matter, thinking it best to wait awhile–say for a week or two, or a month, or two–to see if something wouldn't turn up, or if Mr. Shuttleworthy wouldn't come in the natural way, and explain his reasons for sending his horse on before. 1598144|0|6|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12736|I dare say you have often observed this disposition to temporize, or to procrastinate, in people who are labouring under any very poignant sorrow. 1598614|1|6|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12737|"Their powers of mind seem to be rendered torpid, so that they have a horror of any thing like action, and like nothing in the world so well as to lie quietly in bed and ""nurse their grief,"" as the old ladies express it–that is to say, ruminate over the trouble. 1598760"|2|6|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12738|"The people of Rattleborough had, indeed, so high an opinion of the wisdom and discretion of ""Old Charley,"" that the greater part of them felt disposed to agree with him, and not make a stir in the business ""until something should turn up,"" as the honest old gentleman worded it; and I believe that, after all this would have been the general determination, but for the very suspicious interference of Mr. Shuttleworthy's nephew, a young man of very dissipated habits, and otherwise of rather bad character. 1599021"|0|7|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12739|"This nephew, whose name was Pennifeather, would listen to nothing like reason in the matter of ""lying quiet,"" but insisted upon making immediate search for the ""corpse of the murdered man. 1599527"|1|7|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12740|"–This was the expression he employed; and Mr. Goodfellow acutely remarked at the time, that it was ""a singular expression, to say no more"". 1599715"|2|7|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12741|"This remark of 'Old Charley's,' too, had great effect upon the crowd; and one of the party was heard to ask, very impressively, ""how it happened that young Mr. Pennifeather was so intimately cognizant of all the circumstances connected with his wealthy uncle's disappearance, as to feel authorized to assert, distinctly and unequivocally, that his uncle was 'a murdered man. 1599854"|3|7|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12742|"'"" Hereupon some little squibbing and bickering occurred among various members of the crowd, and especially between ""Old Charley"" and Mr. Pennifeather–although this latter occurrence was, indeed, by no means a novelty, for no good will had subsisted between the parties for the last three or four months; and matters had even gone so far that Mr. Pennifeather had actually knocked down his uncles friend for some alleged excess of liberty that the latter had taken in the uncle's house, of which the nephew was an inmate. 1600228"|4|7|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12743|"Upon this occasion ""Old Charley"" is said to have behaved with exemplary moderation and Christian charity. 1600749"|5|7|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12744|"He arose from the blow, adjusted his clothes, and made no attempt at retaliation at all–merely muttering a few words about ""taking summary vengeance at the first convenient opportunity,""- a natural and very justifiable ebullition of anger, which meant nothing, however, and, beyond doubt, was no sooner given vent to than forgotten. 1600854"|6|7|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12745|However these matters may be (which have no reference to the point now at issue), it is quite certain that the people of Rattleborough, principally through the persuasion of Mr. Pennifeather, came at length to the determination of dispersion over the adjacent country in search of the missing Mr. Shuttleworthy. 1601186|0|8|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12746|I say they came to this determination in the first instance. 1601497|1|8|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12747|After it had been fully resolved that a search should be made, it was considered almost a matter of course that the seekers should disperse–that is to say, distribute themselves in parties–for the more thorough examination of the region round about. 1601557|2|8|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12748|"I forget, however, by what ingenious train of reasoning it was that ""Old Charley"" finally convinced the assembly that this was the most injudicious plan that could be pursued. 1601806"|3|8|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12749|"Convince them, however, he did–all except Mr. Pennifeather, and, in the end, it was arranged that a search should be instituted, carefully and very thoroughly, by the burghers en masse, ""Old Charley"" himself leading the way. 1601981"|4|8|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12750|"As for the matter of that, there could have been no better pioneer than ""Old Charley,"" whom everybody knew to have the eye of a lynx; but, although he led them into all manner of out-of-the-way holes and corners, by routes that nobody had ever suspected of existing in the neighbourhood, and although the search was incessantly kept up day and night for nearly a week, still no trace of Mr. Shuttleworthy could be discovered. 1602205"|0|9|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12751|When I say no trace, however, I must not be understood to speak literally, for trace, to some extent, there certainly was. 1602630|1|9|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12752|The poor gentleman had been tracked, by his horses shoes (which were peculiar), to a spot about three miles to the east of the borough, on the main road leading to the city. 1602752|2|9|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12753|Here the track made off into a by-path through a piece of woodland–the path coming out again into the main road, and cutting off about half a mile of the regular distance. 1602925|3|9|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12754|Following the shoe-marks down this lane, the party came at length to a pool of stagnant water, half hidden by the brambles, to the right of the lane, and opposite this pool all vestige of the track was lost sight of. 1603096|4|9|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12755|It appeared, however, that a struggle of some nature had here taken place, and it seemed as if some large and heavy body, much larger and heavier than a man, had been drawn from the by-path to the pool. 1603312|5|9|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12756|This latter was carefully dragged twice, but nothing was found; and the party was upon the point of going away, in despair of coming to any result, when Providence suggested to Mr. Goodfellow the expediency of draining the water off altogether. 1603514|6|9|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12757|"This project was received with cheers, and many high compliments to ""Old Charley"" upon his sagacity and consideration. 1603758"|7|9|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12758|As many of the burghers had brought spades with them, supposing that they might possibly be called upon to disinter a corpse, the drain was easily and speedily effected; and no sooner was the bottom visible, than right in the middle of the mud that remained was discovered a black silk velvet waistcoat, which nearly every one present immediately recognized as the property of Mr. Pennifeather. 1603876|8|9|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']
12759|This waistcoat was much torn and stained with blood, and there were several persons among the party who had a distinct remembrance of its having been worn by its owner on the very morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy's departure for the city; while there were others, again, ready to testify upon oath, if required, that Mr. P. did not wear the garment in question at any period during the remainder of that memorable day, nor could any one be found to say that he had seen it upon Mr. P.'s person at any period at all subsequent to Mr. Shuttleworthy's disappearance. 1604270|9|9|Thou Art The Man|1844-11-25 00:00:00|['Detective fiction', 'Satire']

12990|I have never yet been able to account, in a manner satisfactory to my own understanding, for the very peculiar countenance and demeanor with which Mr. Crab listened to me, as I unfolded to him my design. 1632396|0|65|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12991|He again went through the scene of the bell-rope and cudgel, and did not omit the duck. 1632599|1|65|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12992|At one period I thought he really intended to quack. 1632686|2|65|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12993|His fit, nevertheless, finally subsided as before, and he began to act and speak in a rational way. 1632738|3|65|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12994|"He declined bearing the cartel, however, and in fact, dissuaded me from sending it at all; but was candid enough to admit that the ""Daddy-Long-Legs"" had been disgracefully in the wrong–more especially in what related to the epithets ""gentleman and scholar"". 1632837"|4|65|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
12995|"Toward the end of this interview with Mr. Crab, who really appeared to take a paternal interest in my welfare, he suggested to me that I might turn an honest penny, and at the same time, advance my reputation, by occasionally playing Thomas Hawk for the ""Lollypop"". 1633094"|0|66|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

12997|"Here Mr. Crab again ""made great eyes"" (as we say in Germany), but at length, recovering himself from a profound attack of astonishment, he assured me that he employed the words ""Thomas Hawk"" to avoid the colloquialism, Tommy, which was low–but that the true idea was Tommy Hawk–or tomahawk–and that by ""playing tomahawk"" he referred to scalping, brow-beating, and otherwise using–up the herd of poor-devil authors. 1633462"|0|68|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

13000|It was captivating. 1634142|10|69|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
13001|Indeed, the reviews I brought to pass by this simple expedient have never been approached, and were the wonder of the world. 1634161|11|69|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
13002|At first, through bashfulness–the result of inexperience–I was a little put out by a certain inconsistency–a certain air of the bizarre (as we say in France), worn by the composition as a whole. 1634285|12|69|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
13003|All the phrases did not fit (as we say in the Anglo-Saxon). 1634479|13|69|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
13004|Many were quite awry. 1634538|14|69|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
13005|Some, even, were upside-down; and there were none of them which were not in some measure, injured in regard to effect, by this latter species of accident, when it occurred–with the exception of Mr. Lewis Clarkes paragraphs, which were so vigorous and altogether stout, that they seemed not particularly disconcerted by any extreme of position, but looked equally happy and satisfactory, whether on their heads, or on their heels. 1634559|15|69|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

13007|I found playing Thomas Hawk, indeed, a far less onerous occupation than poetizing; for I went upon system altogether, and thus it was easy to do the thing thoroughly well. 1635102|3|69|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
13008|My practice was this. 1635273|4|69|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
13009|"I bought auction copies (cheap) of ""Lord Brougham's speeches,"" ""Cobbett's Complete Works,"" the ""New Slang-Syllabus,"" the ""Whole Art of Snubbing,"" ""Prentice's Billingsgate"" (folio edition), and ""Lewis G.

13010|These works I cut up thoroughly with a curry-comb, and then, throwing the shreds into a sieve, sifted out carefully all that might be thought decent (a mere trifle); reserving the hard phrases, which I threw into a large tin pepper-castor with longitudinal holes, so that an entire sentence could get through without material injury. 1635515|6|69|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
13011|The mixture was then ready for use. 1635848|7|69|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
13012|When called upon to play Thomas Hawk, I anointed a sheet of foolscap with the white of a gander's egg; then, shredding the thing to be reviewed as I had previously shredded the books- only with more care, so as to get every word separate–I threw the latter shreds in with the former, screwed on the lid of the castor, gave it a shake, and so dusted out the mixture upon the egged foolscap; where it stuck. 1635883|8|69|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
13013|The effect was beautiful to behold. 1636288|9|69|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

13016|"From a fourth, which I recollect was also the work of a blind man, I selected a page or two all about ""hail"" and ""holy light""; and, although a blind man has no business to write about light, still the verses were sufficiently good in their way. 1636480"|10|7|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
13017|The contemplation of their excellence tended, naturally, to discourage me by comparison with my own abortions; so that for a long time I labored in vain. 1636724|2|7|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
13018|At length there came into my head one of those exquisitely original ideas which now and then will permeate the brain of a man of genius. 1636877|3|7|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
13019|It was this:–or, rather, thus was it carried into execution. 1637013|4|7|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
13020|From the rubbish of an old book-stall, in a very remote corner of the town, I got together several antique and altogether unknown or forgotten volumes. 1637073|5|7|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

13023|"From another, which contained a good many old plays by some person whose name I forget, I enacted in the same manner, and with the same care, a great number of lines about ""angels"" and ""ministers saying grace,"" and ""goblins damned,"" and more besides of that sort. 1637448"|8|7|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']
13024|"From a third, which was the composition of some blind man or other, either a Greek or a Choctaw–I cannot be at the pains of remembering every trifle exactly,–I took about fifty verses beginning with ""Achilles' wrath,"" and ""grease,"" and something else. 1637711"|9|7|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

13026|The most reasonable conclusion is, that he wept himself to death. 1638102|1|70|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

13054|The result of this well-conceived plan, however, (the success of which would have saved me much trouble in after-life,) served to convince me that some editors are not to be bamboozled, and gave the coup-de-grace (as they say in France) to my nascent hopes (as they say in the city of the transcendentals). 1640484|1|8|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

13057|The want of money, however, was, for a few weeks, a source of some discomfort; but at length, by carefully putting to use my two eyes, and observing how matters went just in front of my nose, I perceived how the thing was to be brought about. 1641066|2|80|The Literary Life Of Thingum Bob, Esq.|1844-12-25 00:00:00|['Humor']

13439|Our operations were now directed against the great toe of the right foot. 1696714|1|23|Some Words With A Mummy|1845-04-25 00:00:00|['Satire']

13441|Readjusting the battery, we now applied the fluid to the bisected nerves–when, with a movement of exceeding life-likeness, the Mummy first drew up its right knee so as to bring it nearly in contact with the abdomen, and then, straightening the limb with inconceivable force, bestowed a kick upon Doctor Ponnonner, which had the effect of discharging that gentleman, like an arrow from a catapult, through a window into the street below. 1696919|3|23|Some Words With A Mummy|1845-04-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
13442|We rushed out en masse to bring in the mangled remains of the victim, but had the happiness to meet him upon the staircase, coming up in an unaccountable hurry, brimful of the most ardent philosophy, and more than ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting our experiment with vigor and with zeal. 1697355|0|24|Some Words With A Mummy|1845-04-25 00:00:00|['Satire']

13457|But, perhaps, the true reason is to be sought in the spirit of the age, which proceeds by the rule of contraries altogether, and is now usually admitted as the solution of every thing in the way of paradox and impossibility. 1699355|4|28|Some Words With A Mummy|1845-04-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
13458|Or, perhaps, after all, it was only the Mummy's exceedingly natural and matter-of-course air that divested his words of the terrible. 1699579|5|28|Some Words With A Mummy|1845-04-25 00:00:00|['Satire']

13473|I may as well take this occasion to remark, that all the subsequent conversation in which the Mummy took a part, was carried on in primitive Egyptian, through the medium (so far as concerned myself and other untravelled members of the company)–through the medium, I say, of Messieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, as interpreters. 1701364|0|35|Some Words With A Mummy|1845-04-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
13474|These gentlemen spoke the mother tongue of the Mummy with inimitable fluency and grace; but I could not help observing that (owing, no doubt, to the introduction of images entirely modern, and, of course, entirely novel to the stranger) the two travellers were reduced, occasionally, to the employment of sensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning. 1701688|1|35|Some Words With A Mummy|1845-04-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
13475|"Mr. Gliddon, at one period, for example, could not make the Egyptian comprehend the term ""politics,"" until he sketched upon the wall, with a bit of charcoal a little carbuncle-nosed gentleman, out at elbows, standing upon a stump, with his left leg drawn back, right arm thrown forward, with his fist shut, the eyes rolled up toward Heaven, and the mouth open at an angle of ninety degrees. 1702058"|2|35|Some Words With A Mummy|1845-04-25 00:00:00|['Satire']

13477|It will be readily understood that Mr. Gliddon's discourse turned chiefly upon the vast benefits accruing to science from the unrolling and disembowelling of mummies; apologizing, upon this score, for any disturbance that might have been occasioned him, in particular, the individual Mummy called Allamistakeo; and concluding with a mere hint (for it could scarcely be considered more) that, as these little matters were now explained, it might be as well to proceed with the investigation intended. 1702641|0|36|Some Words With A Mummy|1845-04-25 00:00:00|['Satire']

13479|In regard to the latter suggestions of the orator, it appears that Allamistakeo had certain scruples of conscience, the nature of which I did not distinctly learn; but he expressed himself satisfied with the apologies tendered, and, getting down from the table, shook hands with the company all round. 1703189|0|37|Some Words With A Mummy|1845-04-25 00:00:00|['Satire']

13482|It was now observed that the Count (this was the title, it seems, of Allamistakeo) had a slight fit of shivering–no doubt from the cold. 1703752|0|39|Some Words With A Mummy|1845-04-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
13483|The Doctor immediately repaired to his wardrobe, and soon returned with a black dress coat, made in Jennings' best manner, a pair of sky-blue plaid pantaloons with straps, a pink gingham chemise, a flapped vest of brocade, a white sack overcoat, a walking cane with a hook, a hat with no brim, patent-leather boots, straw-colored kid gloves, an eye-glass, a pair of whiskers, and a waterfall cravat. 1703888|1|39|Some Words With A Mummy|1845-04-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
13484|Owing to the disparity of size between the Count and the doctor (the proportion being as two to one), there was some little difficulty in adjusting these habiliments upon the person of the Egyptian; but when all was arranged, he might have been said to be dressed. 1704287|2|39|Some Words With A Mummy|1845-04-25 00:00:00|['Satire']
13485|Mr. Gliddon, therefore, gave him his arm, and led him to a comfortable chair by the fire, while the Doctor rang the bell upon the spot and ordered a supply of cigars and wine. 1704551|3|39|Some Words With A Mummy|1845-04-25 00:00:00|['Satire']

13509|Well I cannot enter into details just now: but it is necessary to explain that to embalm (properly speaking), in Egypt, was to arrest indefinitely all the animal functions subjected to the process. 1707140|1|51|Some Words With A Mummy|1845-04-25 00:00:00|['Satire']

13658|You are well aware that, as no thought can perish, so no act is without infinite result. 1724642|2|19|The Power Of Words|1845-06-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
13659|We moved our hands, for example, when we were dwellers on the earth, and, in so doing, gave vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it. 1724730|3|19|The Power Of Words|1845-06-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
13660|This vibration was indefinitely extended, till it gave impulse to every particle of the earth's air, which thenceforward, and for ever, was actuated by the one movement of the hand. 1724869|4|19|The Power Of Words|1845-06-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
13661|This fact the mathematicians of our globe well knew. 1725050|5|19|The Power Of Words|1845-06-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
13662|They made the special effects, indeed, wrought in the fluid by special impulses, the subject of exact calculation–so that it became easy to determine in what precise period an impulse of given extent would engirdle the orb, and impress (for ever) every atom of the atmosphere circumambient. 1725102|6|19|The Power Of Words|1845-06-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
13663|Retrograding, they found no difficulty, from a given effect, under given conditions, in determining the value of the original impulse. 1725392|7|19|The Power Of Words|1845-06-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
13664|Now the mathematicians who saw that the results of any given impulse were absolutely endless–and who saw that a portion of these results were accurately traceable through the agency of algebraic analysis–who saw, too, the facility of the retrogradation–these men saw, at the same time, that this species of analysis itself, had within itself a capacity for indefinite progress–that there were no bounds conceivable to its advancement and applicability, except within the intellect of him who advanced or applied it. 1725526|8|19|The Power Of Words|1845-06-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']

13671|Because there were some considerations of deep interest beyond. 1726285|1|21|The Power Of Words|1845-06-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
13672|It was deducible from what they knew, that to a being of infinite understanding–one to whom the perfection of the algebraic analysis lay unfolded–there could be no difficulty in tracing every impulse given the air–and the ether through the air–to the remotest consequences at any even infinitely remote epoch of time. 1726348|2|21|The Power Of Words|1845-06-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
13673|It is indeed demonstrable that every such impulse given the air, must, in the end, impress every individual thing that exists within the universe;–and the being of infinite understanding–the being whom we have imagined–might trace the remote undulations of the impulse- trace them upward and onward in their influences upon all particles of an matter–upward and onward for ever in their modifications of old forms–or, in other words, in their creation of new–until he found them reflected–unimpressive at last–back from the throne of the Godhead. 1726665|3|21|The Power Of Words|1845-06-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
13674|And not only could such a thing do this, but at any epoch, should a given result be afforded him–should one of these numberless comets, for example, be presented to his inspection–he could have no difficulty in determining, by the analytic retrogradation, to what original impulse it was due. 1727211|4|21|The Power Of Words|1845-06-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']
13675|This power of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfection–this faculty of referring at all epochs, all effects to all causes–is of course the prerogative of the Deity alone–but in every variety of degree, short of the absolute perfection, is the power itself exercised by the whole host of the Angelic intelligences. 1727503|5|21|The Power Of Words|1845-06-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction']

13736|It would have been wiser, it would have been safer, to classify (if classify we must) upon the basis of what man usually or occasionally did, and was always occasionally doing, rather than upon the basis of what we took it for granted the Deity intended him to do. 1732798|0|1|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13737|If we cannot comprehend God in his visible works, how then in his inconceivable thoughts, that call the works into being? 1733062|1|1|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13738|If we cannot understand him in his objective creatures, how then in his substantive moods and phases of creation? 1733183|2|1|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13739|One day, whilst sauntering along the streets, I arrested myself in the act of murmuring, half aloud, these customary syllables. 1733296|0|10|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13740|"In a fit of petulance, I remodelled them thus; ""I am safe–I am safe- yes–if I be not fool enough to make open confession""! 1733423"|1|10|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13741|No sooner had I spoken these words, than I felt an icy chill creep to my heart. 1733545|0|11|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13742|I had had some experience in these fits of perversity, (whose nature I have been at some trouble to explain), and I remembered well that in no instance I had successfully resisted their attacks. 1733624|1|11|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13743|And now my own casual self-suggestion that I might possibly be fool enough to confess the murder of which I had been guilty, confronted me, as if the very ghost of him whom I had murdered–and beckoned me on to death. 1733818|2|11|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13744|At first, I made an effort to shake off this nightmare of the soul. 1734034|0|12|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13745|I walked vigorously–faster–still faster–at length I ran. 1734101|1|12|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13746|I turned–I gasped for breath. 1734157|10|12|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13747|For a moment I experienced all the pangs of suffocation; I became blind, and deaf, and giddy; and then some invisible fiend, I thought, struck me with his broad palm upon the back. 1734186|11|12|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13748|The long imprisoned secret burst forth from my soul. 1734366|12|12|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13749|I felt a maddening desire to shriek aloud. 1734418|2|12|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13750|Every succeeding wave of thought overwhelmed me with new terror, for, alas! 1734460|3|12|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13751|I well, too well understood that to think, in my situation, was to be lost. 1734535|4|12|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13752|I still quickened my pace. 1734610|5|12|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13753|I bounded like a madman through the crowded thoroughfares. 1734636|6|12|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13754|At length, the populace took the alarm, and pursued me. 1734694|7|12|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13755|I felt then the consummation of my fate. 1734749|8|12|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13756|Could I have torn out my tongue, I would have done it, but a rough voice resounded in my ears–a rougher grasp seized me by the shoulder. 1734789|9|12|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13757|They say that I spoke with a distinct enunciation, but with marked emphasis and passionate hurry, as if in dread of interruption before concluding the brief, but pregnant sentences that consigned me to the hangman and to hell. 1734925|0|13|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13758|Having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial conviction, I fell prostrate in a swoon. 1735151|0|14|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13759|But why shall I say more? 1735254|0|15|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13760|To-day I wear these chains, and am here! 1735279|1|15|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13761|To-morrow I shall be fetterless! 1735319|2|15|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13762|–but where? 1735351|3|15|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13763|Induction, a posteriori, would have brought phrenology to admit, as an innate and primitive principle of human action, a paradoxical something, which we may call perverseness, for want of a more characteristic term. 1735362|0|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13764|In the sense I intend, it is, in fact, a mobile without motive, a motive not motivirt. 1735577|1|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13765|The phrenological combativeness has for its essence, the necessity of self-defence. 1735663|10|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13766|It is our safeguard against injury. 1735746|11|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13767|Its principle regards our well-being; and thus the desire to be well is excited simultaneously with its development. 1735781|12|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13768|It follows, that the desire to be well must be excited simultaneously with any principle which shall be merely a modification of combativeness, but in the case of that something which I term perverseness, the desire to be well is not only not aroused, but a strongly antagonistical sentiment exists. 1735897|13|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13769|Through its promptings we act without comprehensible object; or, if this shall be understood as a contradiction in terms, we may so far modify the proposition as to say, that through its promptings we act, for the reason that we should not. 1736196|2|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13770|In theory, no reason can be more unreasonable, but, in fact, there is none more strong. 1736436|3|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13771|With certain minds, under certain conditions, it becomes absolutely irresistible. 1736523|4|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13772|I am not more certain that I breathe, than that the assurance of the wrong or error of any action is often the one unconquerable force which impels us, and alone impels us to its prosecution. 1736604|5|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13773|Nor will this overwhelming tendency to do wrong for the wrong's sake, admit of analysis, or resolution into ulterior elements. 1736795|6|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13774|It is a radical, a primitive impulse-elementary. 1736921|7|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13775|It will be said, I am aware, that when we persist in acts because we feel we should not persist in them, our conduct is but a modification of that which ordinarily springs from the combativeness of phrenology. 1736969|8|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13776|But a glance will show the fallacy of this idea. 1737178|9|2|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13777|An appeal to one's own heart is, after all, the best reply to the sophistry just noticed. 1737226|0|3|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13778|No one who trustingly consults and thoroughly questions his own soul, will be disposed to deny the entire radicalness of the propensity in question. 1737315|1|3|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13779|It is not more incomprehensible than distinctive. 1737463|2|3|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13780|There lives no man who at some period has not been tormented, for example, by an earnest desire to tantalize a listener by circumlocution. 1737512|3|3|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13781|The speaker is aware that he displeases; he has every intention to please, he is usually curt, precise, and clear, the most laconic and luminous language is struggling for utterance upon his tongue, it is only with difficulty that he restrains himself from giving it flow; he dreads and deprecates the anger of him whom he addresses; yet, the thought strikes him, that by certain involutions and parentheses this anger may be engendered. 1737650|4|3|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13782|That single thought is enough. 1738087|5|3|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13783|The impulse increases to a wish, the wish to a desire, the desire to an uncontrollable longing, and the longing (to the deep regret and mortification of the speaker, and in defiance of all consequences) is indulged. 1738117|6|3|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13784|We have a task before us which must be speedily performed. 1738332|0|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13785|We know that it will be ruinous to make delay. 1738390|1|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13786|But, if the contest have proceeded thus far, it is the shadow which prevails,–we struggle in vain. 1738436|10|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13787|The clock strikes, and is the knell of our welfare. 1738534|11|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13788|At the same time, it is the chanticleer- note to the ghost that has so long overawed us. 1738585|12|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13789|It flies–it disappears–we are free. 1738673|13|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13790|The old energy returns. 1738708|14|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13791|We will labor now. 1738731|15|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13792|Alas, it is too late! 1738749|16|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13793|The most important crisis of our life calls, trumpet-tongued, for immediate energy and action. 1738770|2|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13794|We glow, we are consumed with eagerness to commence the work, with the anticipation of whose glorious result our whole souls are on fire. 1738864|3|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13795|It must, it shall be undertaken to-day, and yet we put it off until to-morrow, and why? 1739001|4|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13796|There is no answer, except that we feel perverse, using the word with no comprehension of the principle. 1739088|5|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13797|To-morrow arrives, and with it a more impatient anxiety to do our duty, but with this very increase of anxiety arrives, also, a nameless, a positively fearful, because unfathomable, craving for delay. 1739192|6|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13798|This craving gathers strength as the moments fly. 1739392|7|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13799|The last hour for action is at hand. 1739441|8|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13800|We tremble with the violence of the conflict within us,–of the definite with the indefinite–of the substance with the shadow. 1739477|9|4|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13801|We stand upon the brink of a precipice. 1739602|0|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13802|We peer into the abyss–we grow sick and dizzy. 1739641|1|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13803|There is no passion in nature so demoniacally impatient, as that of him who, shuddering upon the edge of a precipice, thus meditates a Plunge. 1739687|10|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13804|To indulge, for a moment, in any attempt at thought, is to be inevitably lost; for reflection but urges us to forbear, and therefore it is, I say, that we cannot. 1739829|11|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13805|If there be no friendly arm to check us, or if we fail in a sudden effort to prostrate ourselves backward from the abyss, we plunge, and are destroyed. 1739991|12|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13806|Our first impulse is to shrink from the danger. 1740142|2|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13807|Unaccountably we remain. 1740189|3|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13808|By slow degrees our sickness and dizziness and horror become merged in a cloud of unnamable feeling. 1740213|4|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13809|By gradations, still more imperceptible, this cloud assumes shape, as did the vapor from the bottle out of which arose the genius in the Arabian Nights. 1740313|5|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13810|But out of this our cloud upon the precipice's edge, there grows into palpability, a shape, far more terrible than any genius or any demon of a tale, and yet it is but a thought, although a fearful one, and one which chills the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the delight of its horror. 1740465|6|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13811|It is merely the idea of what would be our sensations during the sweeping precipitancy of a fall from such a height. 1740767|7|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13812|And this fall–this rushing annihilation- for the very reason that it involves that one most ghastly and loathsome of all the most ghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering which have ever presented themselves to our imagination–for this very cause do we now the most vividly desire it. 1740883|8|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13813|And because our reason violently deters us from the brink, therefore do we the most impetuously approach it. 1741178|9|5|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13814|Examine these similar actions as we will, we shall find them resulting solely from the spirit of the Perverse. 1741286|0|6|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13815|We perpetrate them because we feel that we should not. 1741396|1|6|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13816|Beyond or behind this there is no intelligible principle; and we might, indeed, deem this perverseness a direct instigation of the Arch-Fiend, were it not occasionally known to operate in furtherance of good. 1741450|2|6|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13817|I have said thus much, that in some measure I may answer your question, that I may explain to you why I am here, that I may assign to you something that shall have at least the faint aspect of a cause for my wearing these fetters, and for my tenanting this cell of the condemned. 1741658|0|7|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13818|Had I not been thus prolix, you might either have misunderstood me altogether, or, with the rabble, have fancied me mad. 1741937|1|7|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13819|As it is, you will easily perceive that I am one of the many uncounted victims of the Imp of the Perverse. 1742057|2|7|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13820|It is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a more thorough deliberation. 1742163|0|8|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13821|For weeks, for months, I pondered upon the means of the murder. 1742252|1|8|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13822|I rejected a thousand schemes, because their accomplishment involved a chance of detection. 1742315|2|8|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13823|At length, in reading some French Memoirs, I found an account of a nearly fatal illness that occurred to Madame Pilau, through the agency of a candle accidentally poisoned. 1742406|3|8|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13824|The idea struck my fancy at once. 1742578|4|8|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13825|I knew my victim's habit of reading in bed. 1742611|5|8|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13826|I knew, too, that his apartment was narrow and ill-ventilated. 1742654|6|8|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13827|But I need not vex you with impertinent details. 1742716|7|8|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13828|I need not describe the easy artifices by which I substituted, in his bed-room candle-stand, a wax-light of my own making for the one which I there found. 1742764|8|8|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13829|"The next morning he was discovered dead in his bed, and the Coroner's verdict was–""Death by the visitation of God"". 1742918"|9|8|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13830|Having inherited his estate, all went well with me for years. 1743033|0|9|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13831|The idea of detection never once entered my brain. 1743094|1|9|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13832|It is quite a common thing to be thus annoyed with the ringing in our ears, or rather in our memories, of the burthen of some ordinary song, or some unimpressive snatches from an opera. 1743144|10|9|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13833|Nor will we be the less tormented if the song in itself be good, or the opera air meritorious. 1743329|11|9|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13834|"In this manner, at last, I would perpetually catch myself pondering upon my security, and repeating, in a low undertone, the phrase, ""I am safe"". 1743423"|12|9|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13835|Of the remains of the fatal taper I had myself carefully disposed. 1743568|2|9|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13836|I had left no shadow of a clew by which it would be possible to convict, or even to suspect me of the crime. 1743634|3|9|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13837|It is inconceivable how rich a sentiment of satisfaction arose in my bosom as I reflected upon my absolute security. 1743742|4|9|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
13838|For a very long period of time I was accustomed to revel in this sentiment. 1743858|5|9|The Imp Of The Perverse|1845-07-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

14515|I regard the visions, even as they arise, with an awe which, in some measure moderates or tranquillises the ecstasy–I so regard them, through a conviction (which seems a portion of the ecstasy itself) that this ecstasy, in itself, is of a character supernal to the Human Nature–is a glimpse of the spirit's outer world; and I arrive at this conclusion–if this term is at all applicable to instantaneous intuition–by a perception that the delight experienced has, as its element, but the absoluteness of novelty. 1822192|1|32|Marginalia|1846-01-25 00:00:00|['Essay']

14738|It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season, that I encountered my friend. 1851038|0|4|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14739|He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. 1851149|1|4|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14740|The man wore motley. 1851217|2|4|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14741|He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. 1851237|3|4|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14742|I was so pleased to see him that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand. 1851341|4|4|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14743|He raised it to his lips with a leer. 1851427|0|40|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14744|He paused and nodded to me familiarly, while his bells jingled. 1851464|1|40|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

14747|He again took my arm, and we proceeded. 1851611|0|43|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

14759|The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. 1852129|0|51|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14760|My own fancy grew warm with the Medoc. 1852181|1|51|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14761|We had passed through long walls of piled skeletons, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of the catacombs. 1852219|2|51|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14762|I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunato by an arm above the elbow. 1852354|3|51|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14763|"""The nitre""! 1852441"|0|52|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

14766|We are below the river's bed. 1852515|3|52|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14767|The drops of moisture trickle among the bones. 1852544|4|52|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14768|Come, we will go back ere it is too late. 1852590|5|52|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

14771|I broke and reached him a flagon of De Grave. 1852712|0|54|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14772|He emptied it at a breath. 1852757|1|54|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14773|His eyes flashed with a fierce light. 1852783|2|54|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14774|He laughed and threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand. 1852820|3|54|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14775|I looked at him in surprise. 1852902|0|55|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14776|He repeated the movement --a grotesque one. 1852930|1|55|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14777|"""You do not comprehend""? 1852973"|0|56|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

14794|"""It is this,"" I answered, producing from beneath the folds of my roquelaire a trowel. 1853282"|0|65|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14795|"""You jest,"" he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. 1853367"|0|66|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

14797|"""Be it so,"" I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again offering him my arm. 1853455"|0|67|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14798|He leaned upon it heavily. 1853542|1|67|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14799|We continued our route in search of the Amontillado. 1853568|2|67|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14800|We passed through a range of low arches, descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame. 1853620|3|67|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14801|At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious. 1853810|0|68|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14802|Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris. 1853883|1|68|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14803|Three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. 1854004|2|68|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14804|From the fourth side the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size. 1854076|3|68|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14805|Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we perceived a still interior crypt or recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in height six or seven. 1854209|4|68|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14806|It seemed to have been constructed for no especial use within itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite. 1854382|5|68|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14807|It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavoured to pry into the depth of the recess. 1854619|0|69|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14808|Its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see. 1854724|1|69|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14809|"""I have my doubts,"" I replied; ""and I was silly enough to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. 1854782"|0|7|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14810|"You were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain"". 1854908"|1|7|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

14812|"""He is an ignoramus,"" interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily forward, while I followed immediately at his heels. 1855019"|0|71|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14813|In niche, and finding an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. 1855140|1|71|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14814|A moment more and I had fettered him to the granite. 1855289|2|71|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14815|In its surface were two iron staples, distant from each other about two feet, horizontally. 1855341|3|71|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14816|From one of these depended a short chain, from the other a padlock. 1855432|4|71|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14817|Throwing the links about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. 1855499|5|71|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14818|He was too much astounded to resist. 1855585|6|71|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14819|Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the recess. 1855621|7|71|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14820|"""Pass your hand,"" I said, ""over the wall; you cannot help feeling the nitre. 1855672"|0|72|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14821|Indeed, it is very damp. 1855748|1|72|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14822|Once more let me implore you to return. 1855772|2|72|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14823|No? 1855811|3|72|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14824|Then I must positively leave you. 1855814|4|72|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14825|"But I must first render you all the little attentions in my power"". 1855847"|5|72|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

14827|ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his astonishment. 1855932|1|73|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14828|"""True,"" I replied; ""the Amontillado"". 1855994"|0|74|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14829|As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which I have before spoken. 1856031|0|75|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14830|Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity of building stone and mortar. 1856123|1|75|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14831|With these materials and with the aid of my trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche. 1856201|2|75|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14832|I had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I discovered that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. 1856309|0|76|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14833|The earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess. 1856444|1|76|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14834|It was not the cry of a drunken man. 1856533|2|76|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14835|There was then a long and obstinate silence. 1856569|3|76|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14836|I laid the second tier, and the third, and the fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain. 1856613|4|76|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14837|The noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labours and sat down upon the bones. 1856721|5|76|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14838|When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel, and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh tier. 1856876|6|76|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14839|The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast. 1857011|7|76|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14840|I again paused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within. 1857063|8|76|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14841|A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. 1857173|0|77|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14842|For a brief moment I hesitated, I trembled. 1857304|1|77|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14843|Unsheathing my rapier, I began to grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant reassured me. 1857347|2|77|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14844|I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt satisfied. 1857456|3|77|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14845|I reapproached the wall; I replied to the yells of him who clamoured. 1857532|4|77|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14846|I re-echoed, I aided, I surpassed them in volume and in strength. 1857601|5|77|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14847|I did this, and the clamourer grew still. 1857666|6|77|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14848|It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. 1857707|0|78|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14849|I had completed the eighth, the ninth and the tenth tier. 1857763|1|78|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14850|I had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in. 1857820|2|78|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14851|I struggled with its weight; I placed it partially in its destined position. 1857939|3|78|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14852|But now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head. 1858015|4|78|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14853|It was succeeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognizing as that of the noble Fortunato. 1858101|5|78|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

14877|But is it not getting late? 1858448|7|81|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14878|Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady Fortunato and the rest? 1858475|8|81|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

14885|"""Fortunato""! 1858738"|0|86|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

14889|I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within. 1858788|1|89|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14890|There came forth in return only a jingling of the bells. 1858859|2|89|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14891|My heart grew sick; it was the dampness of the catacombs that made it so. 1858915|3|89|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']
14892|I hastened to make an end of my labour. 1858988|4|89|The Cask Of Amontillado|1846-11-25 00:00:00|['Horror']

14898|TO THE EDITORS OF THE LADY'S BOOK: I have the honor of sending you, for your magazine, an article which I hope you will be able to comprehend rather more distinctly than I do myself. 1859243|0|0|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14899|"It is a translation, by my friend, Martin Van Buren Mavis, (sometimes called the ""Toughkeepsie Seer"") of an odd-looking MS. 1859425"|1|0|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14900|which I found, about a year ago, tightly corked up in a jug floating in the Mare Tenebrarum–a sea well described by the Nubian geographer, but seldom visited now-a-days, except for the transcendentalists and divers for crotchets. 1859548|2|0|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14901|Now, my dear friend, I do assure you, most positively, that I represent this matter fairly, on the soundest authority and you can easily understand how a notion so absurd on its very face must have operated to retard the progress of all true knowledge–which makes its advances almost invariably by intuitive bounds. 1859777|0|10|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14902|The ancient idea confined investigations to crawling; and for hundreds of years so great was the infatuation about Hog especially, that a virtual end was put to all thinking, properly so called. 1860092|1|10|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14903|No man dared utter a truth to which he felt himself indebted to his Soul alone. 1860286|2|10|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14904|It mattered not whether the truth was even demonstrably a truth, for the bullet-headed savans of the time regarded only the road by which he had attained it. 1860365|3|10|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14905|They would not even look at the end. 1860522|4|10|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14906|"""Let us see the means,"" they cried, ""the means""! 1860558"|5|10|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14907|"If, upon investigation of the means, it was found to come under neither the category Aries (that is to say Ram) nor under the category Hog, why then the savans went no farther, but pronounced the ""theorist"" a fool, and would have nothing to do with him or his truth. 1860606"|6|10|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14908|Now, it cannot be maintained, even, that by the crawling system the greatest amount of truth would be attained in any long series of ages, for the repression of imagination was an evil not to be compensated for by any superior certainty in the ancient modes of investigation. 1860872|0|11|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14909|The error of these Jurmains, these Vrinch, these Inglitch, and these Amriccans (the latter, by the way, were our own immediate progenitors), was an error quite analogous with that of the wiseacre who fancies that he must necessarily see an object the better the more closely he holds it to his eyes. 1861147|1|11|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14910|Let me see! 1861446|10|11|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14911|I will go and ask Pundit and be back in a minute. 1861457|11|11|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14912|Ah, here we have it! 1861506|15|11|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14913|Here is a book written nearly a thousand years ago and lately translated from the Inglitch–which, by the way, appears to have been the rudiment of the Amriccan. 1861526|16|11|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14914|Pundit says it is decidedly the cleverest ancient work on its topic, Logic. 1861686|17|11|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14915|The author (who was much thought of in his day) was one Miller, or Mill; and we find it recorded of him, as a point of some importance, that he had a mill-horse called Bentham. 1861761|18|11|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14916|But let us glance at the treatise! 1861937|19|11|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14917|These people blinded themselves by details. 1861971|2|11|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14918|"When they proceeded Hoggishly, their ""facts"" were by no means always facts–a matter of little consequence had it not been for assuming that they were facts and must be facts because they appeared to be such. 1862014"|3|11|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14919|When they proceeded on the path of the Ram, their course was scarcely as straight as a ram's horn, for they never had an axiom which was an axiom at all. 1862221|4|11|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14920|"They must have been very blind not to see this, even in their own day; for even in their own day many of the long ""established"" axioms had been rejected. 1862374"|5|11|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14921|"For example–""Ex nihilo nihil fit""; ""a body cannot act where it is not""; ""there cannot exist antipodes""; ""darkness cannot come out of light""–all these, and a dozen other similar propositions, formerly admitted without hesitation as axioms, were, even at the period of which I speak, seen to be untenable. 1862527"|6|11|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14922|"How absurd in these people, then, to persist in putting faith in ""axioms"" as immutable bases of Truth! 1862830"|7|11|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14923|But even out of the mouths of their soundest reasoners it is easy to demonstrate the futility, the impalpability of their axioms in general. 1862932|8|11|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14924|Who was the soundest of their logicians? 1863072|9|11|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14925|Ah! 1863112|0|12|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14926|"–""Ability or inability to conceive,"" says Mr. Mill, very properly, ""is in no case to be received as a criterion of axiomatic truth"". 1863115"|1|12|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14927|"But this is no answer at all, by his own showing, for has he not just admitted as a truism that ""ability or inability to conceive is in no case to be received as a criterion of axiomatic truth"". 1863247"|10|12|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14928|What modern in his senses would ever think of disputing this truism? 1863441|2|12|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14929|The only wonder with us must be, how it happened that Mr. Mill conceived it necessary even to hint at any thing so obvious. 1863509|3|12|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14930|So far good–but let us turn over another paper. 1863632|4|12|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14931|What have we here? 1863679|5|12|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14932|"- ""Contradictories cannot both be true–that is, cannot co-exist in nature"". 1863697"|6|12|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14933|Here Mr. Mill means, for example, that a tree must be either a tree or not a tree–that it cannot be at the same time a tree and not a tree. 1863772|7|12|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14934|Very well; but I ask him why. 1863911|8|12|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14935|"His reply is this–and never pretends to be any thing else than this–""Because it is impossible to conceive that contradictories can both be true"". 1863940"|9|12|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14936|Now I do not complain of these ancients so much because their logic is, by their own showing, utterly baseless, worthless and fantastic altogether, as because of their pompous and imbecile proscription of all other roads of Truth, of all other means for its attainment than the two preposterous paths–the one of creeping and the one of crawling–to which they have dared to confine the Soul that loves nothing so well as to soar. 1864085|0|13|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14937|By the by, my dear friend, do you not think it would have puzzled these ancient dogmaticians to have determined by which of their two roads it was that the most important and most sublime of all their truths was, in effect, attained? 1864513|0|14|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
14938|I mean the truth of Gravitation. 1864746|1|14|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']

14963|For my part, I make no doubt that a track of some sort must have existed in very remote times, as Pundit asserts; for nothing can be clearer, to my mind, than that, at some period–not less than seven centuries ago, certainly–the Northern and Southern Kanadaw continents were united; the Kanawdians, then, would have been driven, by necessity, to a great railroad across the continent. 1867731|21|16|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']

15033|The whole length of the island is nine miles; the breadth varies materially. 1877887|7|20|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
15034|The entire area (so Pundit says) was, about eight hundred years ago, densely packed with houses, some of them twenty stories high; land (for some most unaccountable reason) being considered as especially precious just in this vicinity. 1877963|8|20|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
15035|The disastrous earthquake, however, of the year 2050, so totally uprooted and overwhelmed the town (for it was almost too large to be called a village) that the most indefatigable of our antiquarians have never yet been able to obtain from the site any sufficient data (in the shape of coins, medals or inscriptions) wherewith to build up even the ghost of a theory concerning the manners, customs, &amp;c. 1878198|9|20|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']

15037|It seems, however, that while digging in the centre of the emperors garden, (which, you know, covers the whole island), some of the workmen unearthed a cubical and evidently chiseled block of granite, weighing several hundred pounds. 1878707|1|21|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']

15040|On one of its surfaces was a marble slab with (only think of it! 1879059|3|21|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']

15134|His plan referred altogether to Sensation. 1888560|17|9|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
15135|He proceeded by observing, analyzing, and classifying facts-instantiae naturae, as they were affectedly called–into general laws. 1888602|18|9|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
15136|Aries Tottle's mode, in a word, was based on noumena; Hog's on phenomena. 1888731|19|9|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
15137|From the car below you know the prospect is not so comprehensive–you can see little vertically. 1888804|2|9|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
15138|Well, so great was the admiration excited by this latter system that, at its first introduction, Aries Tottle fell into disrepute; but finally he recovered ground and was permitted to divide the realm of Truth with his more modern rival. 1888899|20|9|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
15139|The savans now maintained the Aristotelian and Baconian roads were the sole possible avenues to knowledge. 1889136|21|9|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
15140|"""Baconian,"" you must know, was an adjective invented as equivalent to Hog-ian and more euphonious and dignified. 1889242"|22|9|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
15141|But seated here (where I write this) in the luxuriously-cushioned open piazza of the summit, one can see everything that is going on in all directions. 1889354|3|9|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
15142|Just now there is quite a crowd of balloons in sight, and they present a very animated appearance, while the air is resonant with the hum of so many millions of human voices. 1889505|4|9|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
15143|I have heard it asserted that when Yellow or (Pundit will have it) Violet, who is supposed to have been the first aeronaut, maintained the practicability of traversing the atmosphere in all directions, by merely ascending or descending until a favorable current was attained, he was scarcely hearkened to at all by his contemporaries, who looked upon him as merely an ingenious sort of madman, because the philosophers (? 1889679|5|9|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
15144|) of the day declared the thing impossible. 1890100|6|9|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
15145|Really now it does seem to me quite unaccountable how any thing so obviously feasible could have escaped the sagacity of the ancient savans. 1890143|7|9|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
15146|But in all ages the great obstacles to advancement in Art have been opposed by the so-called men of science. 1890283|8|9|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
15147|To be sure, our men of science are not quite so bigoted as those of old:–oh, I have something so queer to tell you on this topic. 1890391|9|9|Mellonta Tauta|1849-02-25 00:00:00|['Science fiction', 'Hoax']
15148|I NEVER knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was. 1890520|0|0|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15149|He seemed to live only for joking. 1890582|1|0|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15150|To tell a good story of the joke kind, and to tell it well, was the surest road to his favor. 1890616|2|0|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15151|Thus it happened that his seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers. 1890709|3|0|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15152|They all took after the king, too, in being large, corpulent, oily men, as well as inimitable jokers. 1890802|4|0|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15153|Whether people grow fat by joking, or whether there is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke, I have never been quite able to determine; but certain it is that a lean joker is a rara avis in terris. 1890903|5|0|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15154|About the refinements, or, as he called them, the 'ghost' of wit, the king troubled himself very little. 1891115|0|1|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15155|He had an especial admiration for breadth in a jest, and would often put up with length, for the sake of it. 1891219|1|1|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15156|Over-niceties wearied him. 1891327|2|1|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15157|He would have preferred Rabelais' 'Gargantua' to the 'Zadig' of Voltaire: and, upon the whole, practical jokes suited his taste far better than verbal ones. 1891353|3|1|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15158|The night appointed for the fete had arrived. 1891509|0|10|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15159|A gorgeous hall had been fitted up, under Trippetta's eye, with every kind of device which could possibly give eclat to a masquerade. 1891554|1|10|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15160|The whole court was in a fever of expectation. 1891687|2|10|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15161|As for costumes and characters, it might well be supposed that everybody had come to a decision on such points. 1891733|3|10|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15162|Many had made up their minds (as to what roles they should assume) a week, or even a month, in advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision anywhere–except in the case of the king and his seven minsters. 1891844|4|10|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15163|Why they hesitated I never could tell, unless they did it by way of a joke. 1892064|5|10|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15164|More probably, they found it difficult, on account of being so fat, to make up their minds. 1892139|6|10|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15165|At all events, time flew; and, as a last resort they sent for Trippetta and Hop-Frog. 1892230|7|10|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15166|When the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found him sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council; but the monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor. 1892315|0|11|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15167|He knew that Hop-Frog was not fond of wine, for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness; and madness is no comfortable feeling. 1892507|1|11|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15168|But the king loved his practical jokes, and took pleasure in forcing Hop-Frog to drink and (as the king called it) 'to be merry. 1892640|2|11|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15169|"""Come here, Hop-Frog,"" said he, as the jester and his friend entered the room; ""swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends, [here Hop-Frog sighed,] and then let us have the benefit of your invention. 1892768"|0|12|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15170|We want characters–characters, man–something novel–out of the way. 1892981|1|12|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15171|We are wearied with this everlasting sameness. 1893047|2|12|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15172|Come, drink! 1893093|3|12|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15173|"the wine will brighten your wits"". 1893105"|4|12|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15174|Hop-Frog endeavored, as usual, to get up a jest in reply to these advances from the king; but the effort was too much. 1893139|0|13|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15175|It happened to be the poor dwarf's birthday, and the command to drink to his 'absent friends' forced the tears to his eyes. 1893257|1|13|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15176|Many large, bitter drops fell into the goblet as he took it, humbly, from the hand of the tyrant. 1893380|2|13|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15177|"""Ah! 1893477"|0|14|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']

15184|his large eyes gleamed, rather than shone; for the effect of wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous. 1893638|1|15|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15185|He placed the goblet nervously on the table, and looked round upon the company with a half–insane stare. 1893768|2|15|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15186|They all seemed highly amused at the success of the king's 'joke. 1893872|3|15|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15187|"""And now to business,"" said the prime minister, a very fat man. 1893937"|0|16|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']

15192|and as this was seriously meant for a joke, his laugh was chorused by the seven. 1894131|4|17|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15193|Hop-Frog also laughed although feebly and somewhat vacantly. 1894211|0|18|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15194|"""Come, come,"" said the king, impatiently, ""have you nothing to suggest""? 1894271"|0|19|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15195|At the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not altogether gone out of fashion at court. 1894343|0|2|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15196|Several of the great continental 'powers' still retain their 'fools,' who wore motley, with caps and bells, and who were expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms, at a moment's notice, in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table. 1894439|1|2|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15197|"""I am endeavoring to think of something novel,"" replied the dwarf, abstractedly, for he was quite bewildered by the wine. 1894695"|0|20|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']

15204|"""Drink, I say""! 1895063"|0|22|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']

15206|The king grew purple with rage. 1895098|1|23|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15207|The courtiers smirked. 1895129|2|23|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15208|Trippetta, pale as a corpse, advanced to the monarch's seat, and, falling on her knees before him, implored him to spare her friend. 1895151|3|23|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15209|The tyrant regarded her, for some moments, in evident wonder at her audacity. 1895283|0|24|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15210|He seemed quite at a loss what to do or say–how most becomingly to express his indignation. 1895360|1|24|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15211|At last, without uttering a syllable, he pushed her violently from him, and threw the contents of the brimming goblet in her face. 1895451|2|24|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15212|The poor girl got up the best she could, and, not daring even to sigh, resumed her position at the foot of the table. 1895581|0|25|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15213|There was a dead silence for about half a minute, during which the falling of a leaf, or of a feather, might have been heard. 1895698|0|26|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15214|It was interrupted by a low, but harsh and protracted grating sound which seemed to come at once from every corner of the room. 1895823|1|26|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15215|"""What–what–what are you making that noise for""? 1895950"|0|27|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']

15219|Our king, as a matter of course, retained his 'fool. 1896079|0|3|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15220|' The fact is, he required something in the way of folly–if only to counterbalance the heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers–not to mention himself. 1896131|1|3|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15221|"""The sound appeared to come from without,"" observed one of the courtiers. 1896299"|0|30|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']

15223|"""True,"" replied the monarch, as if much relieved by the suggestion; ""but, on the honor of a knight, I could have sworn that it was the gritting of this vagabond's teeth"". 1896453"|0|31|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15224|Hereupon the dwarf laughed (the king was too confirmed a joker to object to any one's laughing), and displayed a set of large, powerful, and very repulsive teeth. 1896623|0|32|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15225|Moreover, he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as much wine as desired. 1896785|1|32|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15226|The monarch was pacified; and having drained another bumper with no very perceptible ill effect, Hop-Frog entered at once, and with spirit, into the plans for the masquerade. 1896864|2|32|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15227|"""I cannot tell what was the association of idea,"" observed he, very tranquilly, and as if he had never tasted wine in his life, ""but just after your majesty, had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her face–just after your majesty had done this, and while the parrot was making that odd noise outside the window, there came into my mind a capital diversion–one of my own country frolics–often enacted among us, at our masquerades: but here it will be new altogether. 1897038"|0|33|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']

15241|Dwarfs were as common at court, in those days, as fools; and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through their days (days are rather longer at court than elsewhere) without both a jester to laugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at. 1898424|2|4|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15242|But, as I have already observed, your jesters, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, are fat, round, and unwieldy–so that it was no small source of self-gratulation with our king that, in Hop-Frog (this was the fool's name), he possessed a triplicate treasure in one person. 1898665|3|4|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']

15244|exclaimed the king. 1898964|1|40|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15245|"""Hop-Frog! 1898983"|2|40|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15246|"I will make a man of you"". 1898993"|3|40|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15247|"""The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their jangling. 1899019"|0|41|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15248|You are supposed to have escaped, en masse, from your keepers. 1899097|1|41|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15249|Your majesty cannot conceive the effect produced, at a masquerade, by eight chained ourang-outangs, imagined to be real ones by most of the company; and rushing in with savage cries, among the crowd of delicately and gorgeously habited men and women. 1899159|2|41|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15250|"The contrast is inimitable""! 1899409"|3|41|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15251|"""It must be,"" said the king: and the council arose hurriedly (as it was growing late), to put in execution the scheme of Hop-Frog. 1899437"|0|42|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15252|His mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple, but effective enough for his purposes. 1899567|0|43|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15253|The animals in question had, at the epoch of my story, very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized world; and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently beast-like and more than sufficiently hideous, their truthfulness to nature was thus thought to be secured. 1899672|1|43|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15254|The king and his ministers were first encased in tight-fitting stockinet shirts and drawers. 1899950|0|44|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15255|They were then saturated with tar. 1900042|1|44|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15256|At this stage of the process, some one of the party suggested feathers; but the suggestion was at once overruled by the dwarf, who soon convinced the eight, by ocular demonstration, that the hair of such a brute as the ourang-outang was much more efficiently represented by flu. 1900076|2|44|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15257|A thick coating of the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar. 1900354|3|44|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15258|A long chain was now procured. 1900434|4|44|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15259|First, it was passed about the waist of the king, and tied, then about another of the party, and also tied; then about all successively, in the same manner. 1900464|5|44|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15260|When this chaining arrangement was complete, and the party stood as far apart from each other as possible, they formed a circle; and to make all things appear natural, Hop-Frog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters, at right angles, across the circle, after the fashion adopted, at the present day, by those who capture Chimpanzees, or other large apes, in Borneo. 1900620|6|44|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15261|The grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place, was a circular room, very lofty, and receiving the light of the sun only through a single window at top. 1900995|0|45|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15262|At night (the season for which the apartment was especially designed) it was illuminated principally by a large chandelier, depending by a chain from the centre of the sky-light, and lowered, or elevated, by means of a counter-balance as usual; but (in order not to look unsightly) this latter passed outside the cupola and over the roof. 1901159|1|45|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15263|The arrangements of the room had been left to Trippetta's superintendence; but, in some particulars, it seems, she had been guided by the calmer judgment of her friend the dwarf. 1901497|0|46|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15264|At his suggestion it was that, on this occasion, the chandelier was removed. 1901675|1|46|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15265|Its waxen drippings (which, in weather so warm, it was quite impossible to prevent) would have been seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests, who, on account of the crowded state of the saloon, could not all be expected to keep from out its centre; that is to say, from under the chandelier. 1901751|2|46|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15266|Additional sconces were set in various parts of the hall, out of the war, and a flambeau, emitting sweet odor, was placed in the right hand of each of the Caryatides that stood against the wall–some fifty or sixty altogether. 1902057|3|46|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15267|The eight ourang-outangs, taking Hop-Frog's advice, waited patiently until midnight (when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders) before making their appearance. 1902282|0|47|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15268|No sooner had the clock ceased striking, however, than they rushed, or rather rolled in, all together–for the impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall, and all to stumble as they entered. 1902453|1|47|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15269|The excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious, and filled the heart of the king with glee. 1902660|0|48|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15270|As had been anticipated, there were not a few of the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be beasts of some kind in reality, if not precisely ourang-outangs. 1902757|1|48|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15271|Many of the women swooned with affright; and had not the king taken the precaution to exclude all weapons from the saloon, his party might soon have expiated their frolic in their blood. 1902932|2|48|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15272|As it was, a general rush was made for the doors; but the king had ordered them to be locked immediately upon his entrance; and, at the dwarf's suggestion, the keys had been deposited with him. 1903118|3|48|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15273|While the tumult was at its height, and each masquerader attentive only to his own safety (for, in fact, there was much real danger from the pressure of the excited crowd), the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung, and which had been drawn up on its removal, might have been seen very gradually to descend, until its hooked extremity came within three feet of the floor. 1903311|0|49|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15274|I believe the name 'Hop-Frog' was not that given to the dwarf by his sponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by general consent of the several ministers, on account of his inability to walk as other men do. 1903690|0|5|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15275|In fact, Hop-Frog could only get along by a sort of interjectional gait–something between a leap and a wriggle–a movement that afforded illimitable amusement, and of course consolation, to the king, for (notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional swelling of the head) the king, by his whole court, was accounted a capital figure. 1903908|1|5|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15276|Soon after this, the king and his seven friends having reeled about the hall in all directions, found themselves, at length, in its centre, and, of course, in immediate contact with the chain. 1904264|0|50|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15277|While they were thus situated, the dwarf, who had followed noiselessly at their heels, inciting them to keep up the commotion, took hold of their own chain at the intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle diametrically and at right angles. 1904456|1|50|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15278|Here, with the rapidity of thought, he inserted the hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend; and, in an instant, by some unseen agency, the chandelier-chain was drawn so far upward as to take the hook out of reach, and, as an inevitable consequence, to drag the ourang-outangs together in close connection, and face to face. 1904711|2|50|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15279|The masqueraders, by this time, had recovered, in some measure, from their alarm; and, beginning to regard the whole matter as a well-contrived pleasantry, set up a loud shout of laughter at the predicament of the apes. 1905050|0|51|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15280|"""Leave them to me""! 1905269"|0|52|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15281|now screamed Hop-Frog, his shrill voice making itself easily heard through all the din. 1905288|1|52|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15282|"""Leave them to me. 1905375"|2|52|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15283|I fancy I know them. 1905393|3|52|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15284|"If I can only get a good look at them, I can soon tell who they are"". 1905413"|4|52|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15285|"Here, scrambling over the heads of the crowd, he managed to get to the wall; when, seizing a flambeau from one of the Caryatides, he returned, as he went, to the centre of the room-leaping, with the agility of a monkey, upon the kings head, and thence clambered a few feet up the chain; holding down the torch to examine the group of ourang-outangs, and still screaming: ""I shall soon find out who they are""! 1905482"|0|53|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15286|And now, while the whole assembly (the apes included) were convulsed with laughter, the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle; when the chain flew violently up for about thirty feet–dragging with it the dismayed and struggling ourang-outangs, and leaving them suspended in mid-air between the sky-light and the floor. 1905890|0|54|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15287|Hop-Frog, clinging to the chain as it rose, still maintained his relative position in respect to the eight maskers, and still (as if nothing were the matter) continued to thrust his torch down toward them, as though endeavoring to discover who they were. 1906210|1|54|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15288|So thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent, that a dead silence, of about a minute's duration, ensued. 1906464|0|55|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15289|It was broken by just such a low, harsh, grating sound, as had before attracted the attention of the king and his councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of Trippetta. 1906585|1|55|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15290|But, on the present occasion, there could be no question as to whence the sound issued. 1906767|2|55|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15291|It came from the fang–like teeth of the dwarf, who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at the mouth, and glared, with an expression of maniacal rage, into the upturned countenances of the king and his seven companions. 1906854|3|55|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15292|"""Ah, ha""! 1907078"|0|56|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15293|said at length the infuriated jester. 1907087|1|56|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15294|"""Ah, ha! 1907124"|2|56|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15295|"I begin to see who these people are now""! 1907132"|3|56|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15296|Here, pretending to scrutinize the king more closely, he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him, and which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame. 1907173|4|56|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15297|In less than half a minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely, amid the shrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below, horror-stricken, and without the power to render them the slightest assistance. 1907342|5|56|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15298|At length the flames, suddenly increasing in virulence, forced the jester to climb higher up the chain, to be out of their reach; and, as he made this movement, the crowd again sank, for a brief instant, into silence. 1907566|0|57|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15299|"""I now see distinctly"". 1907783"|0|58|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15300|"he said, ""what manner of people these maskers are. 1907806"|1|58|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15301|They are a great king and his seven privy-councillors,–a king who does not scruple to strike a defenceless girl and his seven councillors who abet him in the outrage. 1907856|2|58|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15302|"As for myself, I am simply Hop-Frog, the jester–and this is my last jest"". 1908022"|3|58|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15303|Owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it adhered, the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the work of vengeance was complete. 1908096|0|59|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15304|The eight corpses swung in their chains, a fetid, blackened, hideous, and indistinguishable mass. 1908276|1|59|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15305|The cripple hurled his torch at them, clambered leisurely to the ceiling, and disappeared through the sky-light. 1908373|2|59|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15306|But although Hop-Frog, through the distortion of his legs, could move only with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor, the prodigious muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms, by way of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled him to perform many feats of wonderful dexterity, where trees or ropes were in question, or any thing else to climb. 1908485|0|6|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15307|At such exercises he certainly much more resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a frog. 1908878|1|6|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15308|It is supposed that Trippetta, stationed on the roof of the saloon, had been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge, and that, together, they effected their escape to their own country: for neither was seen again. 1908972|0|60|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15309|I am not able to say, with precision, from what country Hop-Frog originally came. 1909196|0|7|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15310|It was from some barbarous region, however, that no person ever heard of–a vast distance from the court of our king. 1909277|1|7|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15311|Hop-Frog, and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself (although of exquisite proportions, and a marvellous dancer), had been forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces, and sent as presents to the king, by one of his ever-victorious generals. 1909393|2|7|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15312|Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that a close intimacy arose between the two little captives. 1909676|0|8|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15313|Indeed, they soon became sworn friends. 1909791|1|8|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15314|Hop-Frog, who, although he made a great deal of sport, was by no means popular, had it not in his power to render Trippetta many services; but she, on account of her grace and exquisite beauty (although a dwarf), was universally admired and petted; so she possessed much influence; and never failed to use it, whenever she could, for the benefit of Hop-Frog. 1909830|2|8|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15315|On some grand state occasion–I forgot what–the king determined to have a masquerade, and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind, occurred at our court, then the talents, both of Hop-Frog and Trippetta were sure to be called into play. 1910188|0|9|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15316|Hop-Frog, in especial, was so inventive in the way of getting up pageants, suggesting novel characters, and arranging costumes, for masked balls, that nothing could be done, it seems, without his assistance. 1910431|1|9|Hop-Frog|1849-03-17 00:00:00|['Horror']
15317|AFTER THE very minute and elaborate paper by Arago, to say nothing of the summary in 'Silliman's Journal,' with the detailed statement just published by Lieutenant Maury, it will not be supposed, of course, that in offering a few hurried remarks in reference to Von Kempelen's discovery, I have any design to look at the subject in a scientific point of view. 1910638|0|0|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15318|My object is simply, in the first place, to say a few words of Von Kempelen himself (with whom, some years ago, I had the honor of a slight personal acquaintance), since every thing which concerns him must necessarily, at this moment, be of interest; and, in the second place, to look in a general way, and speculatively, at the results of the discovery. 1910997|1|0|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15319|It may be as well, however, to premise the cursory observations which I have to offer, by denying, very decidedly, what seems to be a general impression (gleaned, as usual in a case of this kind, from the newspapers), viz. 1911351|0|1|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15320|: that this discovery, astounding as it unquestionably is, is unanticipated. 1911573|1|1|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15321|Opening into the garret where they caught him, was a closet, ten feet by eight, fitted up with some chemical apparatus, of which the object has not yet been ascertained. 1911649|0|10|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15322|In one corner of the closet was a very small furnace, with a glowing fire in it, and on the fire a kind of duplicate crucible–two crucibles connected by a tube. 1911818|1|10|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15323|One of these crucibles was nearly full of lead in a state of fusion, but not reaching up to the aperture of the tube, which was close to the brim. 1911978|2|10|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15324|The other crucible had some liquid in it, which, as the officers entered, seemed to be furiously dissipating in vapor. 1912124|3|10|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15325|They relate that, on finding himself taken, Kempelen seized the crucibles with both hands (which were encased in gloves that afterwards turned out to be asbestic), and threw the contents on the tiled floor. 1912242|4|10|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15326|It was now that they hand-cuffed him; and before proceeding to ransack the premises they searched his person, but nothing unusual was found about him, excepting a paper parcel, in his coat-pocket, containing what was afterward ascertained to be a mixture of antimony and some unknown substance, in nearly, but not quite, equal proportions. 1912448|5|10|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15327|All attempts at analyzing the unknown substance have, so far, failed, but that it will ultimately be analyzed, is not to be doubted. 1912787|6|10|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15328|Passing out of the closet with their prisoner, the officers went through a sort of ante-chamber, in which nothing material was found, to the chemist's sleeping-room. 1912919|0|11|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15329|They here rummaged some drawers and boxes, but discovered only a few papers, of no importance, and some good coin, silver and gold. 1913084|1|11|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15330|At length, looking under the bed, they saw a large, common hair trunk, without hinges, hasp, or lock, and with the top lying carelessly across the bottom portion. 1913215|2|11|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15331|Upon attempting to draw this trunk out from under the bed, they found that, with their united strength (there were three of them, all powerful men), they 'could not stir it one inch. 1913377|3|11|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15332|'No wonder we couldn't move it–why it's full to the brim of old bits of brass! 1913559|0|12|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15333|Putting his feet, now, against the wall so as to get a good purchase, and pushing with all his force, while his companions pulled with an theirs, the trunk, with much difficulty, was slid out from under the bed, and its contents examined. 1913637|0|13|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15334|The supposed brass with which it was filled was all in small, smooth pieces, varying from the size of a pea to that of a dollar; but the pieces were irregular in shape, although more or less flat-looking, upon the whole, 'very much as lead looks when thrown upon the ground in a molten state, and there suffered to grow cool. 1913875|1|13|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15335|' Now, not one of these officers for a moment suspected this metal to be any thing but brass. 1914200|2|13|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15336|The idea of its being gold never entered their brains, of course; how could such a wild fancy have entered it? 1914293|3|13|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15337|And their astonishment may be well conceived, when the next day it became known, all over Bremen, that the 'lot of brass' which they had carted so contemptuously to the police office, without putting themselves to the trouble of pocketing the smallest scrap, was not only gold–real gold–but gold far finer than any employed in coinage-gold, in fact, absolutely pure, virgin, without the slightest appreciable alloy. 1914403|4|13|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15338|I need not go over the details of Von Kempelen's confession (as far as it went) and release, for these are familiar to the public. 1914818|0|14|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15339|That he has actually realized, in spirit and in effect, if not to the letter, the old chimaera of the philosopher's stone, no sane person is at liberty to doubt. 1914948|1|14|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15340|The opinions of Arago are, of course, entitled to the greatest consideration; but he is by no means infallible; and what he says of bismuth, in his report to the Academy, must be taken cum grano salis. 1915109|2|14|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15341|The simple truth is, that up to this period all analysis has failed; and until Von Kempelen chooses to let us have the key to his own published enigma, it is more than probable that the matter will remain, for years, in statu quo. 1915310|3|14|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15342|All that as yet can fairly be said to be known is, that 'Pure gold can be made at will, and very readily from lead in connection with certain other substances, in kind and in proportions, unknown. 1915540|4|14|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15343|Speculation, of course, is busy as to the immediate and ultimate results of this discovery–a discovery which few thinking persons will hesitate in referring to an increased interest in the matter of gold generally, by the late developments in California; and this reflection brings us inevitably to another–the exceeding inopportuneness of Von Kempelen's analysis. 1915736|0|15|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15344|If many were prevented from adventuring to California, by the mere apprehension that gold would so materially diminish in value, on account of its plentifulness in the mines there, as to render the speculation of going so far in search of it a doubtful one–what impression will be wrought now, upon the minds of those about to emigrate, and especially upon the minds of those actually in the mineral region, by the announcement of this astounding discovery of Von Kempelen? 1916100|1|15|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15345|a discovery which declares, in so many words, that beyond its intrinsic worth for manufacturing purposes (whatever that worth may be), gold now is, or at least soon will be (for it cannot be supposed that Von Kempelen can long retain his secret), of no greater value than lead, and of far inferior value to silver. 1916573|2|15|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15346|It is, indeed, exceedingly difficult to speculate prospectively upon the consequences of the discovery, but one thing may be positively maintained–that the announcement of the discovery six months ago would have had material influence in regard to the settlement of California. 1916887|3|15|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15347|In Europe, as yet, the most noticeable results have been a rise of two hundred per cent. 1917164|0|16|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15348|in the price of lead, and nearly twenty-five per cent. 1917252|1|16|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15349|that of silver. 1917306|2|16|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15350|By reference to the 'Diary of Sir Humphrey Davy' (Cottle and Munroe, London, pp. 1917321|0|2|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15351|150), it will be seen at pp. 1917401|1|2|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15352|53 and 82, that this illustrious chemist had not only conceived the idea now in question, but had actually made no inconsiderable progress, experimentally, in the very identical analysis now so triumphantly brought to an issue by Von Kempelen, who although he makes not the slightest allusion to it, is, without doubt (I say it unhesitatingly, and can prove it, if required), indebted to the 'Diary' for at least the first hint of his own undertaking. 1917429|2|2|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15353|The paragraph from the 'Courier and Enquirer,' which is now going the rounds of the press, and which purports to claim the invention for a Mr. Kissam, of Brunswick, Maine, appears to me, I confess, a little apocryphal, for several reasons; although there is nothing either impossible or very improbable in the statement made. 1917880|0|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15354|I need not go into details. 1918205|1|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15355|Very little dependence is to be placed upon it, in my humble opinion; and if I were not well aware, from experience, how very easily men of science are mystified, on points out of their usual range of inquiry, I should be profoundly astonished at finding so eminent a chemist as Professor Draper, discussing Mr. Kissam's (or is it Mr. Quizzem's? 1918232|10|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15356|) pretensions to the discovery, in so serious a tone. 1918577|11|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15357|My opinion of the paragraph is founded principally upon its manner. 1918630|2|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15358|It does not look true. 1918697|3|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15359|Persons who are narrating facts, are seldom so particular as Mr. Kissam seems to be, about day and date and precise location. 1918719|4|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15360|Besides, if Mr. Kissam actually did come upon the discovery he says he did, at the period designated- nearly eight years ago–how happens it that he took no steps, on the instant, to reap the immense benefits which the merest bumpkin must have known would have resulted to him individually, if not to the world at large, from the discovery? 1918844|5|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15361|It seems to me quite incredible that any man of common understanding could have discovered what Mr. Kissam says he did, and yet have subsequently acted so like a baby–so like an owl–as Mr. Kissam admits that he did. 1919183|6|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15362|By-the-way, who is Mr. Kissam? 1919398|7|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15363|and is not the whole paragraph in the 'Courier and Enquirer' a fabrication got up to 'make a talk'? 1919428|8|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15364|It must be confessed that it has an amazingly moon-hoaxy-air. 1919527|9|3|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15365|But to return to the 'Diary' of Sir Humphrey Davy. 1919588|0|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15366|This pamphlet was not designed for the public eye, even upon the decease of the writer, as any person at all conversant with authorship may satisfy himself at once by the slightest inspection of the style. 1919638|1|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15367|I say 'his wishes,' for that he meant to include this note-book among the miscellaneous papers directed 'to be burnt,' I think there can be no manner of doubt. 1919843|10|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15368|Whether it escaped the flames by good fortune or by bad, yet remains to be seen. 1920002|11|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15369|That the passages quoted above, with the other similar ones referred to, gave Von Kempelen the hint, I do not in the slightest degree question; but I repeat, it yet remains to be seen whether this momentous discovery itself (momentous under any circumstances) will be of service or disservice to mankind at large. 1920082|12|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15370|That Von Kempelen and his immediate friends will reap a rich harvest, it would be folly to doubt for a moment. 1920395|13|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15371|They will scarcely be so weak as not to 'realize,' in time, by large purchases of houses and land, with other property of intrinsic value. 1920505|14|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15372|At page 13, for example, near the middle, we read, in reference to his researches about the protoxide of azote: 'In less than half a minute the respiration being continued, diminished gradually and were succeeded by analogous to gentle pressure on all the muscles. 1920643|2|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15373|' That the respiration was not 'diminished,' is not only clear by the subsequent context, but by the use of the plural, 'were. 1920907|3|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15374|' The sentence, no doubt, was thus intended: 'In less than half a minute, the respiration [being continued, these feelings] diminished gradually, and were succeeded by [a sensation] analogous to gentle pressure on all the muscles. 1921033|4|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15375|' A hundred similar instances go to show that the MS. 1921263|5|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15376|so inconsiderately published, was merely a rough note-book, meant only for the writer's own eye, but an inspection of the pamphlet will convince almost any thinking person of the truth of my suggestion. 1921316|6|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15377|The fact is, Sir Humphrey Davy was about the last man in the world to commit himself on scientific topics. 1921518|7|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15378|Not only had he a more than ordinary dislike to quackery, but he was morbidly afraid of appearing empirical; so that, however fully he might have been convinced that he was on the right track in the matter now in question, he would never have spoken out, until he had every thing ready for the most practical demonstration. 1921624|8|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15379|I verily believe that his last moments would have been rendered wretched, could he have suspected that his wishes in regard to burning this 'Diary' (full of crude speculations) would have been unattended to; as, it seems, they were. 1921947|9|4|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15380|In the brief account of Von Kempelen which appeared in the 'Home Journal,' and has since been extensively copied, several misapprehensions of the German original seem to have been made by the translator, who professes to have taken the passage from a late number of the Presburg 'Schnellpost. 1922179|0|5|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15381|' 'Viele' has evidently been misconceived (as it often is), and what the translator renders by 'sorrows,' is probably 'lieden,' which, in its true version, 'sufferings,' would give a totally different complexion to the whole account; but, of course, much of this is merely guess, on my part. 1922471|1|5|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15382|Von Kempelen, however, is by no means 'a misanthrope,' in appearance, at least, whatever he may be in fact. 1922762|0|6|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15383|My acquaintance with him was casual altogether; and I am scarcely warranted in saying that I know him at all; but to have seen and conversed with a man of so prodigious a notoriety as he has attained, or will attain in a few days, is not a small matter, as times go. 1922869|1|6|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15384|'The Literary World' speaks of him, confidently, as a native of Presburg (misled, perhaps, by the account in 'The Home Journal') but I am pleased in being able to state positively, since I have it from his own lips, that he was born in Utica, in the State of New York, although both his parents, I believe, are of Presburg descent. 1923135|0|7|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15385|The family is connected, in some way, with Maelzel, of Automaton-chess-player memory. 1923466|1|7|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15386|In person, he is short and stout, with large, fat, blue eyes, sandy hair and whiskers, a wide but pleasing mouth, fine teeth, and I think a Roman nose. 1923551|2|7|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15387|There is some defect in one of his feet. 1923702|3|7|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15388|His address is frank, and his whole manner noticeable for bonhomie. 1923742|4|7|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15389|Altogether, he looks, speaks, and acts as little like 'a misanthrope' as any man I ever saw. 1923809|5|7|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15390|We were fellow-sojouners for a week about six years ago, at Earl's Hotel, in Providence, Rhode Island; and I presume that I conversed with him, at various times, for some three or four hours altogether. 1923901|6|7|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15391|His principal topics were those of the day, and nothing that fell from him led me to suspect his scientific attainments. 1924103|7|7|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15392|He left the hotel before me, intending to go to New York, and thence to Bremen; it was in the latter city that his great discovery was first made public; or, rather, it was there that he was first suspected of having made it. 1924223|8|7|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15393|This is about all that I personally know of the now immortal Von Kempelen; but I have thought that even these few details would have interest for the public. 1924448|9|7|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15394|There can be little question that most of the marvellous rumors afloat about this affair are pure inventions, entitled to about as much credit as the story of Aladdin's lamp; and yet, in a case of this kind, as in the case of the discoveries in California, it is clear that the truth may be stranger than fiction. 1924605|0|8|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15395|The following anecdote, at least, is so well authenticated, that we may receive it implicitly. 1924918|1|8|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15396|Von Kempelen had never been even tolerably well off during his residence at Bremen; and often, it was well known, he had been put to extreme shifts in order to raise trifling sums. 1925012|0|9|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15397|When the great excitement occurred about the forgery on the house of Gutsmuth &amp; Co., suspicion was directed toward Von Kempelen, on account of his having purchased a considerable property in Gasperitch Lane, and his refusing, when questioned, to explain how he became possessed of the purchase money. 1925192|1|9|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15398|He was at length arrested, but nothing decisive appearing against him, was in the end set at liberty. 1925496|2|9|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15399|The police, however, kept a strict watch upon his movements, and thus discovered that he left home frequently, taking always the same road, and invariably giving his watchers the slip in the neighborhood of that labyrinth of narrow and crooked passages known by the flash name of the 'Dondergat. 1925597|3|9|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15400|' Finally, by dint of great perseverance, they traced him to a garret in an old house of seven stories, in an alley called Flatzplatz,–and, coming upon him suddenly, found him, as they imagined, in the midst of his counterfeiting operations. 1925892|4|9|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15401|His agitation is represented as so excessive that the officers had not the slightest doubt of his guilt. 1926133|5|9|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15402|After hand-cuffing him, they searched his room, or rather rooms, for it appears he occupied all the mansarde. 1926237|6|9|Von Kempelen And His Discovery|1849-04-14 00:00:00|['Hoax']
15403|AS it is well known that the 'wise men' came 'from the East,' and as Mr. Touch-and-go Bullet-head came from the East, it follows that Mr. Bullet-head was a wise man; and if collateral proof of the matter be needed, here we have it–Mr. B. was an editor. 1926346|0|0|X-Ing A Paragrab|1849-05-12 00:00:00|['Humor']
15404|Irascibility was his sole foible, for in fact the obstinacy of which men accused him was anything but his foible, since he justly considered it his forte. 1926598|1|0|X-Ing A Paragrab|1849-05-12 00:00:00|['Humor']
15405|It was his strong point–his virtue; and it would have required all the logic of a Brownson to convince him that it was 'anything else. 1926752|2|0|X-Ing A Paragrab|1849-05-12 00:00:00|['Humor']
15406|' I have shown that Touch-and-go Bullet-head was a wise man; and the only occasion on which he did not prove infallible, was when, abandoning that legitimate home for all wise men, the East, he migrated to the city of Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis, or some place of a similar title, out West. 1926886|3|0|X-Ing A Paragrab|1849-05-12 00:00:00|['Humor']
15407|I must do him the justice to say, however, that when he made up his mind finally to settle in that town, it was under the impression that no newspaper, and consequently no editor, existed in that particular section of the country. 1927178|0|1|X-Ing A Paragrab|1849-05-12 00:00:00|['Humor']
15408|In establishing 'The Tea-Pot' he expected to have the field all to himself. 1927408|1|1|X-Ing A Paragrab|1849-05-12 00:00:00|['Humor']
15409|I feel confident he never would have dreamed of taking up his residence in Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis had he been aware that, in Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis, there lived a gentleman named John Smith (if I rightly remember), who for many years had there quietly grown fat in editing and publishing the 'Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis Gazette. 1927483|2|1|X-Ing A Paragrab|1849-05-12 00:00:00|['Humor']
15410|' It was solely, therefore, on account of having been misinformed, that Mr. Bullet-head found himself in Alex-suppose we call it Nopolis, 'for short'–but, as he did find himself there, he determined to keep up his character for obst–for firmness, and remain. 1927828|3|1|X-Ing A Paragrab|1849-05-12 00:00:00|['Humor']
15411|So remain he did; and he did more; he unpacked his press, type, etc. 1928086|4|1|X-Ing A Paragrab|1849-05-12 00:00:00|['Humor']

15413|, rented an office exactly opposite to that of the 'Gazette,' and, on the third morning after his arrival, issued the first number of 'The Alexan'–that is to say, of 'The Nopolis Tea-Pot'–as nearly as I can recollect, this was the name of the new paper. 1928160|6|1|X-Ing A Paragrab|1849-05-12 00:00:00|['Humor']
15414|Meantime the devil, to whom the copy was entrusted, ran up stairs to his 'case,' in an unutterable hurry, and forthwith made a commencement at 'setting' the MS. 1928413|0|10|X-Ing A Paragrab|1849-05-12 00:00:00|['Humor']

15556|DURING A pedestrian trip last summer, through one or two of the river counties of New York, I found myself, as the day declined, somewhat embarrassed about the road I was pursuing. 1939603|0|0|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15557|The land undulated very remarkably; and my path, for the last hour, had wound about and about so confusedly, in its effort to keep in the valleys, that I no longer knew in what direction lay the sweet village of B-, where I had determined to stop for the night. 1939783|1|0|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15558|The road, however, except in being open through the wood–if wood be not too weighty a name for such an assemblage of light trees–and except in the particulars of evident wheel-tracks–bore no resemblance to any road I had before seen. 1940044|10|0|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15559|The tracks of which I speak were but faintly perceptible–having been impressed upon the firm, yet pleasantly moist surface of–what looked more like green Genoese velvet than any thing else. 1940277|11|0|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15560|It was grass, clearly–but grass such as we seldom see out of England–so short, so thick, so even, and so vivid in color. 1940466|12|0|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15561|Not a single impediment lay in the wheel-route–not even a chip or dead twig. 1940586|13|0|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15562|The stones that once obstructed the way had been carefully placed–not thrown-along the sides of the lane, so as to define its boundaries at bottom with a kind of half-precise, half-negligent, and wholly picturesque definition. 1940662|14|0|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15563|Clumps of wild flowers grew everywhere, luxuriantly, in the interspaces. 1940888|15|0|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15564|The sun had scarcely shone–strictly speaking–during the day, which nevertheless, had been unpleasantly warm. 1940960|2|0|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15565|A smoky mist, resembling that of the Indian summer, enveloped all things, and of course, added to my uncertainty. 1941068|3|0|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15566|Not that I cared much about the matter. 1941181|4|0|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15567|If I did not hit upon the village before sunset, or even before dark, it was more than possible that a little Dutch farmhouse, or something of that kind, would soon make its appearance–although, in fact, the neighborhood (perhaps on account of being more picturesque than fertile) was very sparsely inhabited. 1941220|5|0|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15568|At all events, with my knapsack for a pillow, and my hound as a sentry, a bivouac in the open air was just the thing which would have amused me. 1941529|6|0|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15569|I sauntered on, therefore, quite at ease–Ponto taking charge of my gun–until at length, just as I had begun to consider whether the numerous little glades that led hither and thither, were intended to be paths at all, I was conducted by one of them into an unquestionable carriage track. 1941673|7|0|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15570|There could be no mistaking it. 1941960|8|0|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15571|The traces of light wheels were evident; and although the tall shrubberies and overgrown undergrowth met overhead, there was no obstruction whatever below, even to the passage of a Virginian mountain wagon–the most aspiring vehicle, I take it, of its kind. 1941991|9|0|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15572|What to make of all this, of course I knew not. 1942247|0|1|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15573|"Here was art undoubtedly–that did not surprise me–all roads, in the ordinary sense, are works of art; nor can I say that there was much to wonder at in the mere excess of art manifested; all that seemed to have been done, might have been done here–with such natural ""capabilities"" (as they have it in the books on Landscape Gardening)–with very little labor and expense. 1942294"|1|1|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15574|No; it was not the amount but the character of the art which caused me to take a seat on one of the blossomy stones and gaze up and down this fairy–like avenue for half an hour or more in bewildered admiration. 1942664|2|1|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15575|One thing became more and more evident the longer I gazed: an artist, and one with a most scrupulous eye for form, had superintended all these arrangements. 1942874|3|1|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15576|The greatest care had been taken to preserve a due medium between the neat and graceful on the one hand, and the pittoresque, in the true sense of the Italian term, on the other. 1943030|4|1|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15577|There were few straight, and no long uninterrupted lines. 1943208|5|1|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15578|The same effect of curvature or of color appeared twice, usually, but not oftener, at any one point of view. 1943265|6|1|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15579|Everywhere was variety in uniformity. 1943373|7|1|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15580|"It was a piece of ""composition,"" in which the most fastidiously critical taste could scarcely have suggested an emendation. 1943410"|8|1|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15581|The lake was deep–at some points thirty feet–but the rivulet seldom exceeded three, while its greatest width was about eight. 1943533|0|10|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15582|Its bottom and banks were as those of the pond–if a defect could have been attributed, in point of picturesqueness, it was that of excessive neatness. 1943658|1|10|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15583|The expanse of the green turf was relieved, here and there, by an occasional showy shrub, such as the hydrangea, or the common snowball, or the aromatic seringa; or, more frequently, by a clump of geraniums blossoming gorgeously in great varieties. 1943808|0|11|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15584|These latter grew in pots which were carefully buried in the soil, so as to give the plants the appearance of being indigenous. 1944056|1|11|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15585|Besides all this, the lawn's velvet was exquisitely spotted with sheep–a considerable flock of which roamed about the vale, in company with three tamed deer, and a vast number of brilliantly–plumed ducks. 1944183|2|11|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15586|A very large mastiff seemed to be in vigilant attendance upon these animals, each and all. 1944387|3|11|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15587|Along the eastern and western cliffs–where, toward the upper portion of the amphitheatre, the boundaries were more or less precipitous–grew ivy in great profusion–so that only here and there could even a glimpse of the naked rock be obtained. 1944477|0|12|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15588|The northern precipice, in like manner, was almost entirely clothed by grape-vines of rare luxuriance; some springing from the soil at the base of the cliff, and others from ledges on its face. 1944719|1|12|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15589|The slight elevation which formed the lower boundary of this little domain, was crowned by a neat stone wall, of sufficient height to prevent the escape of the deer. 1944912|0|13|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15590|Nothing of the fence kind was observable elsewhere; for nowhere else was an artificial enclosure needed:–any stray sheep, for example, which should attempt to make its way out of the vale by means of the ravine, would find its progress arrested, after a few yards' advance, by the precipitous ledge of rock over which tumbled the cascade that had arrested my attention as I first drew near the domain. 1945077|1|13|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15591|In short, the only ingress or egress was through a gate occupying a rocky pass in the road, a few paces below the point at which I stopped to reconnoitre the scene. 1945478|2|13|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15592|I have described the brook as meandering very irregularly through the whole of its course. 1945642|0|14|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15593|Its two general directions, as I have said, were first from west to east, and then from north to south. 1945732|1|14|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15594|At the turn, the stream, sweeping backward, made an almost circular loop, so as to form a peninsula which was very nearly an island, and which included about the sixteenth of an acre. 1945835|2|14|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15595|"On this peninsula stood a dwelling-house–and when I say that this house, like the infernal terrace seen by Vathek, ""etait d'une architecture inconnue dans les annales de la terre,"" I mean, merely, that its tout ensemble struck me with the keenest sense of combined novelty and propriety–in a word, of poetry–(for, than in the words just employed, I could scarcely give, of poetry in the abstract, a more rigorous definition)–and I do not mean that merely outre was perceptible in any respect. 1946018"|3|14|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15596|In fact nothing could well be more simple–more utterly unpretending than this cottage. 1946510|0|15|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15597|Its marvellous effect lay altogether in its artistic arrangement as a picture. 1946596|1|15|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15598|I could have fancied, while I looked at it, that some eminent landscape-painter had built it with his brush. 1946674|2|15|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15599|The point of view from which I first saw the valley, was not altogether, although it was nearly, the best point from which to survey the house. 1946782|0|16|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15600|I will therefore describe it as I afterwards saw it- from a position on the stone wall at the southern extreme of the amphitheatre. 1946925|1|16|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15601|The main building was about twenty-four feet long and sixteen broad- certainly not more. 1947056|0|17|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15602|Its total height, from the ground to the apex of the roof, could not have exceeded eighteen feet. 1947144|1|17|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15603|These latter did not extend to the floor, but were much longer and narrower than usual–they had single shutters like doors- the panes were of lozenge form, but quite large. 1947241|10|17|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15604|The door itself had its upper half of glass, also in lozenge panes–a movable shutter secured it at night. 1947413|11|17|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15605|The door to the west wing was in its gable, and quite simple–a single window looked out to the south. 1947518|12|17|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15606|There was no external door to the north wing, and it also had only one window to the east. 1947619|13|17|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15607|To the west end of this structure was attached one about a third smaller in all its proportions:–the line of its front standing back about two yards from that of the larger house, and the line of its roof, of course, being considerably depressed below that of the roof adjoining. 1947709|2|17|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15608|At right angles to these buildings, and from the rear of the main one–not exactly in the middle–extended a third compartment, very small- being, in general, one-third less than the western wing. 1947988|3|17|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15609|The roofs of the two larger were very steep–sweeping down from the ridge-beam with a long concave curve, and extending at least four feet beyond the walls in front, so as to form the roofs of two piazzas. 1948182|4|17|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15610|These latter roofs, of course, needed no support; but as they had the air of needing it, slight and perfectly plain pillars were inserted at the corners alone. 1948386|5|17|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15611|The roof of the northern wing was merely an extension of a portion of the main roof. 1948545|6|17|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15612|Between the chief building and western wing arose a very tall and rather slender square chimney of hard Dutch bricks, alternately black and red:–a slight cornice of projecting bricks at the top. 1948629|7|17|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15613|Over the gables the roofs also projected very much:–in the main building about four feet to the east and two to the west. 1948823|8|17|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15614|The principal door was not exactly in the main division, being a little to the east–while the two windows were to the west. 1948944|9|17|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15615|The blank wall of the eastern gable was relieved by stairs (with a balustrade) running diagonally across it–the ascent being from the south. 1949067|0|18|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15616|Under cover of the widely projecting eave these steps gave access to a door leading to the garret, or rather loft–for it was lighted only by a single window to the north, and seemed to have been intended as a store-room. 1949207|1|18|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15617|The piazzas of the main building and western wing had no floors, as is usual; but at the doors and at each window, large, flat irregular slabs of granite lay imbedded in the delicious turf, affording comfortable footing in all weather. 1949427|0|19|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15618|Excellent paths of the same material–not nicely adapted, but with the velvety sod filling frequent intervals between the stones, led hither and thither from the house, to a crystal spring about five paces off, to the road, or to one or two out–houses that lay to the north, beyond the brook, and were thoroughly concealed by a few locusts and catalpas. 1949662|1|19|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15619|I had turned to the right as I entered this road, and now, arising, I continued in the same direction. 1950014|0|2|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15620|The path was so serpentine, that at no moment could I trace its course for more than two or three paces in advance. 1950116|1|2|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15621|Its character did not undergo any material change. 1950231|2|2|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15622|Not more than six steps from the main door of the cottage stood the dead trunk of a fantastic pear-tree, so clothed from head to foot in the gorgeous bignonia blossoms that one required no little scrutiny to determine what manner of sweet thing it could be. 1950281|0|20|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15623|From various arms of this tree hung cages of different kinds. 1950538|1|20|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15624|In one, a large wicker cylinder with a ring at top, revelled a mocking bird; in another an oriole; in a third the impudent bobolink–while three or four more delicate prisons were loudly vocal with canaries. 1950599|2|20|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15625|The pillars of the piazza were enwreathed in jasmine and sweet honeysuckle; while from the angle formed by the main structure and its west wing, in front, sprang a grape-vine of unexampled luxuriance. 1950805|0|21|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15626|Scorning all restraint, it had clambered first to the lower roof–then to the higher; and along the ridge of this latter it continued to writhe on, throwing out tendrils to the right and left, until at length it fairly attained the east gable, and fell trailing over the stairs. 1951005|1|21|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15627|The whole house, with its wings, was constructed of the old-fashioned Dutch shingles–broad, and with unrounded corners. 1951282|0|22|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15628|It is a peculiarity of this material to give houses built of it the appearance of being wider at bottom than at top–after the manner of Egyptian architecture; and in the present instance, this exceedingly picturesque effect was aided by numerous pots of gorgeous flowers that almost encompassed the base of the buildings. 1951401|1|22|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15629|The shingles were painted a dull gray; and the happiness with which this neutral tint melted into the vivid green of the tulip tree leaves that partially overshadowed the cottage, can readily be conceived by an artist. 1951722|0|23|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15630|From the position near the stone wall, as described, the buildings were seen at great advantage–for the southeastern angle was thrown forward–so that the eye took in at once the whole of the two fronts, with the picturesque eastern gable, and at the same time obtained just a sufficient glimpse of the northern wing, with parts of a pretty roof to the spring-house, and nearly half of a light bridge that spanned the brook in the near vicinity of the main buildings. 1951940|0|24|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15631|I did not remain very long on the brow of the hill, although long enough to make a thorough survey of the scene at my feet. 1952406|0|25|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15632|It was clear that I had wandered from the road to the village, and I had thus good traveller's excuse to open the gate before me, and inquire my way, at all events; so, without more ado, I proceeded. 1952529|1|25|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15633|The road, after passing the gate, seemed to lie upon a natural ledge, sloping gradually down along the face of the north-eastern cliffs. 1952728|0|26|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15634|It led me on to the foot of the northern precipice, and thence over the bridge, round by the eastern gable to the front door. 1952864|1|26|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15635|In this progress, I took notice that no sight of the out-houses could be obtained. 1952989|2|26|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15636|As I turned the corner of the gable, the mastiff bounded towards me in stern silence, but with the eye and the whole air of a tiger. 1953071|0|27|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15637|I held him out my hand, however, in token of amity–and I never yet knew the dog who was proof against such an appeal to his courtesy. 1953203|1|27|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15638|He not only shut his mouth and wagged his tail, but absolutely offered me his paw-afterward extending his civilities to Ponto. 1953336|2|27|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15639|As no bell was discernible, I rapped with my stick against the door, which stood half open. 1953462|0|28|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15640|Instantly a figure advanced to the threshold- that of a young woman about twenty-eight years of age–slender, or rather slight, and somewhat above the medium height. 1953553|1|28|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15641|As she approached, with a certain modest decision of step altogether indescribable. 1953717|2|28|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15642|"I said to myself, ""Surely here I have found the perfection of natural, in contradistinction from artificial grace"". 1953800"|3|28|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15643|The second impression which she made on me, but by far the more vivid of the two, was that of enthusiasm. 1953915|4|28|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15644|So intense an expression of romance, perhaps I should call it, or of unworldliness, as that which gleamed from her deep-set eyes, had never so sunk into my heart of hearts before. 1954020|5|28|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15645|I know not how it is, but this peculiar expression of the eye, wreathing itself occasionally into the lips, is the most powerful, if not absolutely the sole spell, which rivets my interest in woman. 1954199|6|28|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15646|"""Romance, provided my readers fully comprehended what I would here imply by the word–""romance"" and ""womanliness"" seem to me convertible terms: and, after all, what man truly loves in woman, is simply her womanhood. 1954397"|7|28|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15647|"The eyes of Annie (I heard some one from the interior call her ""Annie, darling""! 1954611"|8|28|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15648|") were ""spiritual grey;"" her hair, a light chestnut: this is all I had time to observe of her. 1954691"|9|28|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15649|At her most courteous of invitations, I entered–passing first into a tolerably wide vestibule. 1954785|0|29|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15650|Having come mainly to observe, I took notice that to my right as I stepped in, was a window, such as those in front of the house; to the left, a door leading into the principal room; while, opposite me, an open door enabled me to see a small apartment, just the size of the vestibule, arranged as a study, and having a large bow window looking out to the north. 1954879|1|29|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15651|Presently the murmur of water fell gently upon my ear–and in a few moments afterward, as I turned with the road somewhat more abruptly than hitherto, I became aware that a building of some kind lay at the foot of a gentle declivity just before me. 1955240|0|3|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15652|I could see nothing distinctly on account of the mist which occupied all the little valley below. 1955487|1|3|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15653|A gentle breeze, however, now arose, as the sun was about descending; and while I remained standing on the brow of the slope, the fog gradually became dissipated into wreaths, and so floated over the scene. 1955584|2|3|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15654|Passing into the parlor, I found myself with Mr. Landor–for this, I afterwards found, was his name. 1955790|0|30|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15655|He was civil, even cordial in his manner, but just then, I was more intent on observing the arrangements of the dwelling which had so much interested me, than the personal appearance of the tenant. 1955889|1|30|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15656|The north wing, I now saw, was a bed-chamber, its door opened into the parlor. 1956086|0|31|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15657|West of this door was a single window, looking toward the brook. 1956164|1|31|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15658|At the west end of the parlor, were a fireplace, and a door leading into the west wing–probably a kitchen. 1956228|2|31|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15659|Nothing could be more rigorously simple than the furniture of the parlor. 1956334|0|32|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15660|On the floor was an ingrain carpet, of excellent texture–a white ground, spotted with small circular green figures. 1956407|1|32|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15661|At the windows were curtains of snowy white jaconet muslin: they were tolerably full, and hung decisively, perhaps rather formally in sharp, parallel plaits to the floor–just to the floor. 1956522|2|32|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15662|The walls were prepared with a French paper of great delicacy, a silver ground, with a faint green cord running zig-zag throughout. 1956710|3|32|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15663|Its expanse was relieved merely by three of Julien's exquisite lithographs a trois crayons, fastened to the wall without frames. 1956841|4|32|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15664|"One of these drawings was a scene of Oriental luxury, or rather voluptuousness; another was a ""carnival piece,"" spirited beyond compare; the third was a Greek female head–a face so divinely beautiful, and yet of an expression so provokingly indeterminate, never before arrested my attention. 1956969"|5|32|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15665|"The more substantial furniture consisted of a round table, a few chairs (including a large rocking-chair), and a sofa, or rather ""settee;"" its material was plain maple painted a creamy white, slightly interstriped with green; the seat of cane. 1957260"|0|33|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15666|"The chairs and table were ""to match,"" but the forms of all had evidently been designed by the same brain which planned ""the grounds;"" it is impossible to conceive anything more graceful. 1957503"|1|33|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15667|On the table were a few books, a large, square, crystal bottle of some novel perfume, a plain ground–glass astral (not solar) lamp with an Italian shade, and a large vase of resplendently-blooming flowers. 1957689|0|34|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15668|Flowers, indeed, of gorgeous colours and delicate odour formed the sole mere decoration of the apartment. 1957894|1|34|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15669|The fire-place was nearly filled with a vase of brilliant geranium. 1957999|2|34|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15670|On a triangular shelf in each angle of the room stood also a similar vase, varied only as to its lovely contents. 1958066|3|34|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15671|One or two smaller bouquets adorned the mantel, and late violets clustered about the open windows. 1958179|4|34|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15672|It is not the purpose of this work to do more than give in detail, a picture of Mr. Landor's residence–as I found it. 1958277|0|35|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15673|How he made it what it was–and why–with some particulars of Mr. Landor himself- may, possibly form the subject of another article. 1958394|1|35|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15674|"As it came fully into view–thus gradually as I describe it–piece by piece, here a tree, there a glimpse of water, and here again the summit of a chimney, I could scarcely help fancying that the whole was one of the ingenious illusions sometimes exhibited under the name of ""vanishing pictures"". 1958524"|0|4|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15675|By the time, however, that the fog had thoroughly disappeared, the sun had made its way down behind the gentle hills, and thence, as it with a slight chassez to the south, had come again fully into sight, glaring with a purplish lustre through a chasm that entered the valley from the west. 1958818|0|5|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15676|Suddenly, therefore–and as if by the hand of magic- this whole valley and every thing in it became brilliantly visible. 1959108|1|5|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15677|The first coup d'oeil, as the sun slid into the position described, impressed me very much as I have been impressed, when a boy, by the concluding scene of some well-arranged theatrical spectacle or melodrama. 1959227|0|6|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15678|Not even the monstrosity of color was wanting; for the sunlight came out through the chasm, tinted all orange and purple; while the vivid green of the grass in the valley was reflected more or less upon all objects from the curtain of vapor that still hung overhead, as if loth to take its total departure from a scene so enchantingly beautiful. 1959436|1|6|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15679|The little vale into which I thus peered down from under the fog canopy could not have been more than four hundred yards long; while in breadth it varied from fifty to one hundred and fifty or perhaps two hundred. 1959781|0|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15680|It was most narrow at its northern extremity, opening out as it tended southwardly, but with no very precise regularity. 1959994|1|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15681|Here, generally, the slopes were nothing more than gentle inclinations, extending from east to west about one hundred and fifty yards. 1960114|10|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15682|In the middle of this extent was a depression, level with the ordinary floor of the valley. 1960248|11|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15683|As regards vegetation, as well as in respect to every thing else, the scene softened and sloped to the south. 1960339|12|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15684|To the north–on the craggy precipice–a few paces from the verge–up sprang the magnificent trunks of numerous hickories, black walnuts, and chestnuts, interspersed with occasional oak, and the strong lateral branches thrown out by the walnuts especially, spread far over the edge of the cliff. 1960448|13|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15685|Proceeding southwardly, the explorer saw, at first, the same class of trees, but less and less lofty and Salvatorish in character; then he saw the gentler elm, succeeded by the sassafras and locust–these again by the softer linden, red-bud, catalpa, and maple–these yet again by still more graceful and more modest varieties. 1960740|14|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15686|The whole face of the southern declivity was covered with wild shrubbery alone–an occasional silver willow or white poplar excepted. 1961065|15|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15687|In the bottom of the valley itself–(for it must be borne in mind that the vegetation hitherto mentioned grew only on the cliffs or hillsides)–were to be seen three insulated trees. 1961197|16|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15688|One was an elm of fine size and exquisite form: it stood guard over the southern gate of the vale. 1961377|17|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15689|Another was a hickory, much larger than the elm, and altogether a much finer tree, although both were exceedingly beautiful: it seemed to have taken charge of the northwestern entrance, springing from a group of rocks in the very jaws of the ravine, and throwing its graceful body, at an angle of nearly forty-five degrees, far out into the sunshine of the amphitheatre. 1961475|18|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15690|About thirty yards east of this tree stood, however, the pride of the valley, and beyond all question the most magnificent tree I have ever seen, unless, perhaps, among the cypresses of the Itchiatuckanee. 1961845|19|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15691|The widest portion was within eighty yards of the southern extreme. 1962050|2|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15692|It was a triple–stemmed tulip-tree–the Liriodendron Tulipiferum–one of the natural order of magnolias. 1962117|20|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15693|Its three trunks separated from the parent at about three feet from the soil, and diverging very slightly and gradually, were not more than four feet apart at the point where the largest stem shot out into foliage: this was at an elevation of about eighty feet. 1962219|21|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15694|The whole height of the principal division was one hundred and twenty feet. 1962480|22|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15695|Nothing can surpass in beauty the form, or the glossy, vivid green of the leaves of the tulip-tree. 1962555|23|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15696|In the present instance they were fully eight inches wide; but their glory was altogether eclipsed by the gorgeous splendor of the profuse blossoms. 1962654|24|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15697|Conceive, closely congregated, a million of the largest and most resplendent tulips! 1962802|25|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15698|Only thus can the reader get any idea of the picture I would convey. 1962886|26|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15699|And then the stately grace of the clean, delicately–granulated columnar stems, the largest four feet in diameter, at twenty from the ground. 1962954|27|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15700|The innumerable blossoms, mingling with those of other trees scarcely less beautiful, although infinitely less majestic, filled the valley with more than Arabian perfumes. 1963094|28|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15701|The slopes which encompassed the vale could not fairly be called hills, unless at their northern face. 1963265|3|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15702|Here a precipitous ledge of granite arose to a height of some ninety feet; and, as I have mentioned, the valley at this point was not more than fifty feet wide; but as the visiter proceeded southwardly from the cliff, he found on his right hand and on his left, declivities at once less high, less precipitous, and less rocky. 1963367|4|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15703|All, in a word, sloped and softened to the south; and yet the whole vale was engirdled by eminences, more or less high, except at two points. 1963693|5|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15704|One of these I have already spoken of. 1963834|6|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15705|It lay considerably to the north of west, and was where the setting sun made its way, as I have before described, into the amphitheatre, through a cleanly cut natural cleft in the granite embankment; this fissure might have been ten yards wide at its widest point, so far as the eye could trace it. 1963872|7|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15706|It seemed to lead up, up like a natural causeway, into the recesses of unexplored mountains and forests. 1964170|8|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15707|The other opening was directly at the southern end of the vale. 1964274|9|7|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15708|The general floor of the amphitheatre was grass of the same character as that I had found in the road; if anything, more deliciously soft, thick, velvety, and miraculously green. 1964337|0|8|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15709|It was hard to conceive how all this beauty had been attained. 1964515|1|8|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15710|I have spoken of two openings into the vale. 1964577|0|9|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15711|From the one to the northwest issued a rivulet, which came, gently murmuring and slightly foaming, down the ravine, until it dashed against the group of rocks out of which sprang the insulated hickory. 1964621|1|9|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15712|A light birch canoe that lay placidly on the water, was reflected in its minutest fibres with a fidelity unsurpassed by the most exquisitely polished mirror. 1964822|10|9|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15713|A small island, fairly laughing with flowers in full bloom, and affording little more space than just enough for a picturesque little building, seemingly a fowl-house–arose from the lake not far from its northern shore–to which it was connected by means of an inconceivably light–looking and yet very primitive bridge. 1964979|11|9|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15714|It was formed of a single, broad and thick plank of the tulip wood. 1965297|12|9|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15715|This was forty feet long, and spanned the interval between shore and shore with a slight but very perceptible arch, preventing all oscillation. 1965364|13|9|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15716|"From the southern extreme of the lake issued a continuation of the rivulet, which, after meandering for, perhaps, thirty yards, finally passed through the ""depression"" (already described) in the middle of the southern declivity, and tumbling down a sheer precipice of a hundred feet, made its devious and unnoticed way to the Hudson. 1965507"|14|9|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15717|Here, after encircling the tree, it passed on a little to the north of east, leaving the tulip tree some twenty feet to the south, and making no decided alteration in its course until it came near the midway between the eastern and western boundaries of the valley. 1965840|2|9|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15718|At this point, after a series of sweeps, it turned off at right angles and pursued a generally southern direction meandering as it went–until it became lost in a small lake of irregular figure (although roughly oval), that lay gleaming near the lower extremity of the vale. 1966105|3|9|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15719|This lakelet was, perhaps, a hundred yards in diameter at its widest part. 1966378|4|9|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15720|No crystal could be clearer than its waters. 1966452|5|9|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15721|Its bottom, which could be distinctly seen, consisted altogether, of pebbles brilliantly white. 1966496|6|9|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15722|Its banks, of the emerald grass already described, rounded, rather than sloped, off into the clear heaven below; and so clear was this heaven, so perfectly, at times, did it reflect all objects above it, that where the true bank ended and where the mimic one commenced, it was a point of no little difficulty to determine. 1966591|7|9|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15723|The trout, and some other varieties of fish, with which this pond seemed to be almost inconveniently crowded, had all the appearance of veritable flying-fish. 1966913|8|9|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
15724|It was almost impossible to believe that they were not absolutely suspended in the air. 1967071|9|9|Landor'S Cottage|1849-06-09 00:00:00|['Sketch']
